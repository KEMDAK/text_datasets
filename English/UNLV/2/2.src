rine limit (Fig. 2-2) show a distinct pattern of
calving-bay propagation into northern Lauren-
tide ice.This pattern in itself is a strong indicator
that the maximum reconstruction in Figure 2-2
is more nearly correct than the minimum. The
sea penetrated northwestern ice-stream channels
in M'Clure Strait and Amundsen Gulf by 12,600
BP, at least 3000 yr prior to penetration of the
eastern ice-stream channel in Lancaster Sound.
In fact, the Amundsen Gulf ice stream had re-
ceded by 10,215 BP to Coronation Gulf, where
a bottleneck checked calving-bay propagation;
also, the M'Clure Strait ice stream lay against the
Winter Harbor moraine between about 11,000
and 10,000 BP, without concurrent recession of
the Lancaster Sound ice stream in the east. Rapid
breakup of northern Laurentide ice commenced
after 10,000 BP with the withdrawal of ice from
the Winter Harbor moraine. A calving bay had
propagated eastward into Viscount Melville
Sound by 9800 BP and into Barrow Strait north
of Prince of Wales and Somerset Islands by 9380
BP. Westward propagation of a calving bay into
Lancaster Sound was underway by 9280 BP. Sub-
sequently, coastal Somerset and Prince of Wales
Islands, as well as northern Boothia Peninsula,
were largely cleared of ice by 9200 BP, and the
southern Gulf of Boothia was cleared by 8870
BP. Thus, the northern sector of the Laurentide
Ice Sheet was dissected by calving bays that
propagated inland to the upper marine limit. By
8160 BP, the northern ice-sheet margin, no
longer being dissected by calving bays, lay
against the MacAlpine moraine system (Blake,
1966), which partly outlines the residual Kee-
watin dome, and against moraines on Melville
Peninsula (Craig, 1965a), which may possibly
mark the western margin of a residual dome in
Foxe Basin. Recession from these moraine sys-
tems and final ice-sheet disintegration are dis-
cussed with the history of the interior of the Lau-
rentide Ice Sheet.
Northeastern Sector
Late Wisconsin Maximum. The northeastern
margin of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, particularly
in Labrador and Baffin Island, is discussed in
detail here, because the concepts derived from
studies of this margin have greatly influenced
development of the model of a restricted Arctic
ice cover during the late Wisconsin glaciation. At
its maximum, the northeastern margin of the Lau-
rentide Ice Sheet extended from the Maritime
Provinces to northern Baffin Island. Along this
margin, the coastal mountains of Labrador-Un-
gava and Baffin Island are the dissected edges of
plateau blocks that have been uplifted and tilted.
Of two early views of Wisconsin ice extent, the
first proposed limited Wisconsin ice extent. Fol-
lowing the work by Lieber (1861), Daly (1902)
suggested that the Torngat Mountains in Labra-
dor were not overtopped by Labradorean (Lau-
rentide) ice that streamed through deep troughs
toward the Atlantic. This conclusion was based
largely on the observed upper limit of glacier
deposits, as well as on the presence of wide-
spread felsenmeer at high levels. Coleman (1920,
1921) later agreed with these conclusions and
even argued that Laurentide ice did not reach
the Atlantic. Coleman (1921, 1926) further pos-
tulated that Wisconsin Laurentide ice did not
overrun the southeast coast of Labrador and that
the widespread presence of high-lying felsen-
meer suggests that much of Newfoundland re-
mained free of ice throughout Wisconsin time.
The second early theory, which supported more-
extensive Wisconsin ice, was put forward by
Odell (1933) and accepted by Tanner (1944). The
main evidence cited for this viewpoint was the
presence of high-level erratics and poorly pre-
served striations; the felsenmeer was assigned a
postglacial age. Flint and others (1942) postu-
lated, on the basis of high erratics and striated
surfaces, that the Shickshock Mountains in the
Gaspe Peninsula were overrun by Wisconsin ice;
felsenmeer on the summits was again thought to
have originated in postglacial time. Subse-
quently, Flint (1971, p. 484-485) inferred that the
Laurentide Ice Sheet overran all coastal high-
lands between New York and Labrador at some
time during the Wisconsin glaciation.
The modern view of Wisconsin ice extent has
its roots in field work carried out in the past two
decades (reviewed by Ives, 1978). The major re-
sult has been the development of the weathering
2zone concept. The weathering zones envisioned
are not to be confused with the geologic terms
''weathering zone'' or ''zone of weathering,'
which refer to a weathered zone in bedrock or
regolith that is nearly parallel with the surface
(Flint, 1971, p. 287). Rather, it refers to ''units of
the land surface which are distinguishable from
each other on the basis of the distinct weathering
features that record different lengths of time
through which they have formed'' (Dyke, 1977,
p. 40). Three broad weathering zones, as well as
possible subdivisions, have been recognized
along the entire northeastern margin of the Lau-
have played an important role in recession of
southern and western LLaurentide terrestrial mar-
gins, because the deeper lakes may temporarily
have given these margins a marine character. If
ice streams entering the proglacial lakes became
afloat, they woule have acquired the same ability
to pull ice out of the ice sheet, as did floating
ice-stream tongues along LLaurentide marine mar-
gins. This suggests that calving bays in the
deeper proglacial lakes could have migrated up
the ice-stream channels and have cleared ice
from these lake basins.
Downdraw of the northwestern sector of the
Laurentide Ice Sheet, and perhaps of the western
margin of the Innuitian Ice Sheet, through ma-
rine ice streams was probably underway by 14,-
000 BP, because calving bays had propagated
into M'Clure Strait and probably into Amundsen
Gulf by 12,600 BP and because Prince Patrick
Island was at least partially free of ice by 11,660
BP. It is rather striking that deglaciation of coasts
or inter-island channels elsewhere in the Queen
Elizabeth Islands or along the northern Lauren-
tide margin apparently had not occurred by this
time.
Disintegration of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet
after 14,000 BP may have been rapid along its
eastern and western margins tor several reasons.
Dissipation of the Laurentide ice fan on the
plains of western Canada may have created an
ice-free corridor in northeastern British Colum-
bia, where merger of the Laurentide and Cordil-
leran Ice Sheets may have previously created an
ice saddle. Ice saddles typically are high enough
to lie above the equilibrium line, so the eastern
Cordilleran margin in northwestern Alberta and
northeastern British Columbia was probably in
an accumulation zone when the saddle existed,
but was suddenly thrown into an ice-ablation
zone after the corridor formed. This might have
thrown this portion of the eastern margin of the
Cordilleran Ice Sheet into a negative mass bal-
ance regime, causing rapid retreat. The western
margin retreated when calving bays carved away
any ice-shelf fringe confined in the straits and
sounds or pinned by the island archipelago aloug
the Pacific coast. Removal of any ice-shelf fringe,
as well as sea-level rise and climatic warming,
would have allowed ice streams occupying fiords
in the Coast Mountains to surge. Such surges
could downdraw the western fringe of the Cor-
dilleran Ice Sheet, allowing calving bays to mi-
grate into the coastal fiords. The southern margin
receded by marginal recession and downwasting.
General recession after 14,000 BP, which appar-
ently was interrupted only by the Sumas read-
vance, left only mountain-glacier complexes and
possibly residual ice caps by 9000 BP.
Figure 2-6 shows our reconstruction of glaciol-
ogical conditions at 10,000 BP, after ice fans
along the southern and western terrestrial mar-
gins of the Laurentide Ice Sheet had been re-
placed by proglacial lakes in the Great Lakes and
the Great Plains and after possible ice shelves
along the northern and northeastern Laurentide
Ice Sheet marine margins had been replaced by
open waters in the Arctic Ocean and Baffin Bay.
A calving bay had migrated up the Amundsen
Gulf ice stream as far as Queen Maud Gulf, but
an ice stream still occupied much of M'Clure
Strait. Downdraw of Innuitian and northern Lau-
rentide ice was caused by surging ice streams
passing through LLancaster Sound, through inter-
island channels leading outward from the central
Norwegian Bay area of the Queen Elizabeth Is-
lands, and through channels between Ellesmere
Island and Greenland.
The overall chronology of northern deglacia-
tion shows delayed ice recession with the first
deglaciation in the west about 12,600 BP, fol-
lowed by progressively younger deglaciation in
the east. This northern marine deglaciation is
thus distinctly different from southern terrestrial
deglaciation in timing and pattern. As indicated
in Chapter S, we think that the pattern and chro-
nology of northern deglaciation reflect recession
of an ice shelf on the Arctic Ocean that, in turn,
regulated downdraw through northern ice
streams and subsequent inland propagation of
calving bays.
North American Ice Sheets: 10,000 BP to 6000
BP. The central event of this interval was the
final collapse of the Innuitian and Laurentide
Ice Sheets, caused largely by downdraw through
surging marine ice streams followed by calving-
bay migration up ice-stream channels. By this
mechanism, the Parry Channel south of the
Queen Elizabeth Islands opened between 9500
and 9000 BP, the channel between Ellesmere
Island and Greenland began to open by 9500 BP,
and most interisland channels beneath the In-
nuitian Ice Sheet were carved out by about 9000
BP. Calving bays propagated deep into northern
lLaurentide ice between 9500 and 8800 BP.
Meanwhile, continued downdraw through the
surging Hudson Strait ice stream greatly deep-
ened the Hudson Bay ice saddle, leading to
not bordered by ice shelves and terrestrial mar-
gins bordered by deep proglacial lakes.
Conclusions. These glaciological speculations
emphasize that marine ice-sheet dynamics dom-
inated late Wisconsin collapse of the eastern,
northeastern, northern, and interior sectors of the
Laurentide Ice Sheet, as well as all sectors of the
Innuitian Ice Sheet; these dynamics are dis-
cussed in more detail in Chapters 7 and 8. Thus
large quantities of atmospheric heat need not be
invoked to melt these ice sheets, because surging
ice streams on marine margins transported inter-
ior ice seaward, where it could melt. Ice would
therefore be transported to the heat source,
rather than the reverse. Also, the predominance
of marine dynamics means that the climatic
change necessary to induce overall late Wiscon-
sin deglaciation need not be extraordinarily
large, for the ice sheet could partly self-destruct
through the positive feedback mechanisms de-
scribed in Chapter 8. In short, climatic amelio-
ration could melt southern terrestrial ice-sheet
sectors, leading to a sea-level rise that could in-
duce further collapse of marine margins because
of their inherent instability. For example, sea-
level rise caused by climatic warming during the
Erie interstade could trigger increased down-
draw through the Laurentian and Hudson Strait
ice streams, as well as recession of the marine
West Antarctic Ice Sheet (Chapter 7) and marine
sectors of other ice sheets, The secondary sea-
level rise induced by downdraw could, in turn,
trigger further marine recession. The predomi-
nance of marine processes in the northern, north-
eastern, and interior sectors of the Laurentide
Ice Sheet also explains the asymmetrical reces-
sion toward Baffin Island, whose high eastern
rim would protect the northeastern flank of the
ice sheet from marine inroads, delaying ice col-
lapse until calving bays eventually propagated
into Foxe Basin, These processes may not have
been restricted solely to marine ice-sheet mar-
gins; they may also have operated where deep
proglacial lakes abutted retreating terrestrial
margins.
The glaciological speculations given in this
section highlight the southern terrestrial margin
of the Laurentide Ice Sheet as the most likely
area for climatic reversals to cause readvances
superimposed on overall late Wisconsin degla-
ciation. This is because widespread late Wiscon-
sin stagnation may have characterized much of
the western sector and because climatic reversals
may not have affected ongoing downdraw and
calving-bay migration in marine ice-sheet sec-
tors, However, caution must be exercised in in-
terpreting widespread fluctuations of the south-
ern Laurentide margin in terms of climatic
change, because downdraw through marine sec-
tors could have controlled the positions of inter-
ior domes and saddles, thereby influencing events
on far-distant terrestrial margins.
One major component of the Antarctic Ice
Sheet-namely, ice shelves-has been largely ig-
nored in this discussion of North American ice
sheets, The possible role of large ice shelves in
the late Wisconsin history of Northern Hemi-
sphere ice sheets is discussed in Chapter 8, in-
cluding the following two points. First, it is quite
possible that large late Wisconsin ice shelves
covered the Arctic Ocean and Baffin Bay; if so,
they may have regulated outward flow through
marine ice streams. The effect of ice shelves in
buttressing ice streams is discussed in Chapter
7. Second, our discussion of deglaciation of
northern marine ice assumes that the oldest
shells from near the marine limit closely postdate
grounding-line recession. This ignores the pos-
sibility that the highest shell-bearing marine sed-
iments or beaches may reflect recession of ice-
shelf calving fronts rather than recession of ice-
shelf grounding lines. In either case, the geologic
record would miss a major element of deglacia-
tion-namely, the prolonged downdraw through
surging ice streams that preceded propagation of
calving bays up former ice-stream channels.

ice tongues are weak links between ice shelves
and ice streams partly because of surface warm-
ing by katabatic winds. Surface warming de-
creases ice-hardness parameter A in the flow law
of ice.
A rapid increase in the intensity of surface cre-
Vasses seems to occur when ice streams move
faster than about 500 m/yr. Photographs of Ant-
arctic ice streams on both sides of this velocity
threshold show the surface transformation
(Swithinbank, 1964, 1977). The ice-stream sur-
face is completely transformed from a relatively
smooth featureless landscape to a chaotic jumble
of large seracs and crevasses arrayed in alternat-
ing ridges and furrows aligned with the flow di-
rection, This transformation also occurs during
surges of mountain glaciers, so it is natural to
conclude that fast-moving, heavily crevassed
Antarctic ice streams are in a continuously surg-
ing state (Weertman, 1969). However, a correla-
tion of the lengths of ice-stream tongues with the
intensity of ice-stream crevassing suggests that
surges come and go for some of the important ice
streams supplying West Antarctic ice to the Ross
lce Shelf (Hughes, 1975).
Surface ablation of ice streams by katabatic
winds is increased manyfold when ice-stream
velocity crosses the surge threshold, because the
change in crevasse intensity greatly increases the
ice-stream surface area exposed to melting, evap-
oration, and sublimation. Unevaporated surface
meltwater flows into crevasses and refreezes be-
fore ice crosses the grounding line, This warms
the ice stream by releasing latent heat but does
not contribute to ablation. After ice crosses the
grounding line, the bottom surface can also be-
come heavily crevassed, and water-filled bottom
crevasses can migrate upward to meet surface
crevasses, The amount of surface meltwater that
flows into surface crevasses and reaches water-
filled bottom crevasses without refreezing con-
tributes to surface ablation. Since the latent heat
of evaporation is over seven times the latent heat
of melting, if only one-seventh of the surface
meltwater enters crevasses and escapes refreez-
ing, it still causes as much surface ablation as
evaporation does, Surface ablation by sublima-
tion occurs primarily during the cold Antarctic
night. Sublimation is an important component of
surface ablation on Antarctic glaciers (Bull and
Carnein, 1970) and sublimation rates should in-
crease as dry katabatic winds respond to climatic
warming.
Even if climatic warming does not throw the
surface of an ice shelf into an ablation regime,
thus creating a dendritic network of surface melt-
water streams that drain into crevasses in the ice-
stream and bedrock weak links of the ice shelf,
climatic warming can affect ice-stream weak
links if the ice streams are already in an ablation
regime from katabatic winds and if their surface
areas are already heavily crevassed by a surge.
The major effect is to thin the ice stream by
increasing surface ablation, so that the ice-stream
grounding line is forced to retreat.
Basal melting along ice-shelf grounding lines
has received little attention, and no attempt has
been made to measure it directly. This is unfor-
tunate, because determining whether ice-shelf
grounding lines in Antarctica are currently re-
treating or advancing depends in large measure
on the rates of melting or freezing along these
grounding lines. Hughes (1972, 1973) first sug-
gested that basal melting prevailed along Ross
Ice Shelf grounding lines of the West Antarctic
Ice Sheet, because most glacial geological and
glaciological work by others seemed to indicate
that the Ross Sea sector of the West Antarctic Ice
Sheet continued to collapse in Holocene time
after the disintegration of Northern Hemisphere
ice sheets no longer contributed to rising sea
level. Basal melting along ice-shelf grounding
lines, particularly where ice streams entered the
ice shelf, seemed to be the best way to continue
disintegration of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet;
because basal melting would have the same ef-
fect as increasing sea level-namely, by forcing
ice-shelf grounding lines to retreat.
Using data from the RISS traverse, Hughes
(1972) attempted to determine whether basal
melting or freezing exists today along the Siple
Coast grounding line of the Ross Ice Shelf. His
study is not generally available so it is repro-
duced here in amended form. According to Fig-
ure 7-37, about the same degree of bending con-
verging flow occurs between the grounding line
of ice stream C and RISS station 133 as occurs
between RISS stations 133 and 53. Insofar as the
average ice hardness parameter A depends on
the stress field, it should be about the same for
both flowline segments. Applying equation (88)
to the segment between RISS stations 133 and
53, we find

As discussed in the Appendix, it is difficult to assign appropriate

absorption calibration curves. For smectite and alkali feldspar, the
estimated error is believed to be approximately 6-10% whenn the phase is
abundant (-50 modal percent), but mx:h greater, approximately 33%, whhen
the phase is present in only minor amounts ( -3 modal percent). For
reasons explained in the report, estimated errors in calculated weight
percents of zeolites are believed to be somewhat larger than corre-
sponding values for smectite and alkali feldsper.

1. Topopeh Spring tuff from Busted Butte is similar texturally to the
samples of Topopah Spring tuff from borehole USWG1, but the outcrop
material and core material differ somewhat mineralogically. For
example, the two core samples were found to have lower
qguartz/cristobalite ratios. More importantly, however, the core
samples contain significant quantities of smectite (approximately 10X
by weight), whereas the outcrop material from Busted Butte contains
only trace amounts of smectite.
2. No ma,jor differences in bulk or clay mineralogy were detected among
the five size fractions of Busted Butte outcrop material. In fact, the
samples exhibited only one minor mineralogic variation: an apparent
decrease in quartz and a concomitant increase in alkali feldsper with
decreasing mesh size.

Fifteen liters (4 gal) of J-13 well water were received from the U.S.
At 25% C and near pH 7 the uranyl carbonate, hydroxide, and pyro-
phosphate will react with sulfide to precipitate pitchblende which has a very
small crystallite size, The concentration of uranium in solution when
either the uranyl carbonate or hydroxide reacts with the sulfide ion is less
than 10- M[. The uranyl pyrophosphate reaction with sulfide has been
only qualitatively investigated. Uranyl fluoride reacts with the sulfide
ion at 25 C to precipitate uranium tetrafluoride, UF,, The uranium in
solution above UF, is less than 10- Mi. The sulfide ion has no effect on
the solubility of uranium IV in solution other than to assist in keeping it
in its reduced state. The hydroxide ion, however, reacts with uranium IV'
at 25f C near pH 7 to precipitate pitchblende. It has a very small crystallite
size.
At the elevated temperature of 215 C and near pH 7 uranyl carbonate,
hydroxide, fluoride, and pyrophosphate react with sulfide, sulfite, and hy-
drogen gas to precipitate pitchblende which has a large crystallite size.
The concentration of uranium in solution above the pitchblende is less than
10- M, when sulfide ions react with uranyl carbonate, hydroxide and
fluoride at 215* C. Uranium IV in an inert or HgS atmosphere at 215? C
and near pH 7 reacts with water to precipitate pitchblende. It has a large
crystallite size. The concentration of uranium in solution above the
pitchblende is less than 10- M.
Foreign cations are known to react with complex uranium ions and form
precipitates. They will also change the chemical properties of solutions,

PREPARATION OF MAP
The drainage basins above each gaging
station were outlined on tracing paper laid
over Geological Survey base maps of, the United
States, and the figures of aversge runoff were
entered within the basin outlines. The base
maps used were those showing drainage and re-
11er.
Wherever possible , opportunity was taken
to oalculate runoff from partisl bas in areas
and thus define areal variations in runoff
more close ly. This was done by subtracting
the flow at one or more upstream stations from
that at a domnstream a tation. It m1st be rec-
ognized that the runoff thus computed for an
intervening area comonly represents the dif-
ference be tween two comparative ly large qusn-
tities and is sub ject to a relatively large
error either tn the figures of discharge or in
the drainage area. Neverthe less, such sub-
traction when expressed in terms of discharge
per unit of ares produces a result that is
highly informative in connection with the
study of the geographic distribution of runoff.
The runoff isograms were drawn so thst
the figure plotted would conform to the aver-
age runoff in each basin or partial basin.- In
basins where the runoff vsried greatly, the
delineation of the isograms was aided by s tudy
of the general pa ttern, by reference to pre-
oipitation, or by knowledge of the terrain.
lIn such basins the extremes in runoff may be
greatly in error - for example, along mountain
3. For snapshot simulations of, e.g., 50 or 100 m.y. ago, the paleogeogra-
phy and SST boundary conditions and the paleoclimatic data used for com-
parison with the simulated results are averaged over a 1- to 5-m.y, period.
Therefore, the distribution of solar radiation with latitude and season should
be an average calculated over many cycles of orbital periodicities.
5.4.5. AtmosphericAerosol Content. It is well known from both observa-
tionsand climate modeling(Toon and Pollack, 1980; Turco et al., 1982)that
atmospheric aerosols can affect climate. This is because they scatter and
absorb shortwave radiation and absorb and emit infrared radiation (IR)
(Prospero et al., 1983). Observations of surface temperature anomalies
following major volcanic eruptions and the results of climate modeling
indicate that stratospheric aerosols increase the temperature in the lower
stratosphere and reduce surface temperature. This is because the effect due
to the increase in planetary albedo is greater than that due to the absorption
and emission of IR (Pollack et al., 1976).
Stratospheric aerosol content is closely related to one source, explosive
volcanic eruptions that periodically inject silicate dust particles and sulfur
gases (HS, SO4) into the stratosphere. The sulfur gases are converted
through photochemical reactions to sulfuric acid particles. After major
eruptions, stratospheric aerosols decline to background levels after 1- 2 yr
(Castleman et al., 1974). While the mean global atmospheric optical depth
(r)due to aerosol is in the range 0.05 to 0.2 (Deirmendjian, 1971; Pollack et
al., 1976), and major eruptions can increase this to 0.4-0.5 for several
months, the mean volcanic contribution over the last few centuries to total
atmospheric aerosol r has been - 0.02, constituting about 80% of the total
stratospheric aerosol r (Pollack et al., 1976). Therefore, periods of en-
hanced volcanicactivity in the geological past could have had climaticeffects
through increased r. Approximate estimates of the variation of strato-
spheric aerosol content can be made, given a knowledge of changes in the
global rate ofvolcanism through time. This could be achieved by the follow-
ing methods.
1. Major volcanic episodes (lasting maybe a few million years) can be
recognized in the geologic record from widespread and thick ash horizons
(Axelrod, 1981). However, there is insufficient data to document changes
in the global rate of volcanism with any confidence.
2. The global average ocean floor spreading rate slowly varies over tens of
millions of years. This must affect mean rates of volcanism at midocean
ridges and in island arcs and Andean mountain belts along destructive plate
margins. Hays and Pitman (1973)argued that the mean ocean floor spread-
ingrate between 110 and 85 m.y. ago was double the presentvalue [although
during the last few hundred years (125). It may also
signify a decrease in local weed (NAP) pollen produc-
tion, to be expected when a pueblo or other prehistoric
village was abandoned. An apparent increase in tree
pollen would accompany the decrease in herb pollen
following abandonment and the end of disturbance by
man, without benefit of forest expansion or climatic
change.
In brief, the major features of postpluvial climatic
history are threefold: an initial arid period (zone IV)
climatically equivalent to the present and dating 8,000
- 10,500 B. P.; next, a less arid interval (zone III)
with an intensified monsoon rainfall, the climate per-
haps no warmer but slightly wetter than at present, and
corresponding in time to the classic ''altithermal,'' 4,000
to 8,000 B. P.; and finally an arid period (zones I and
II) closely resembling present conditions but with at
least one possible shift in the seasonal distribution of
rainfall and lasting from 4,000 B. P. to the present.
There is a strong resemblance to the classic threefold
postglacial pollen sequence of von Post.
IX. A REAPPRAISAL OF POSTPLUVIAL CLIMATES
Recent pollen analysis of pluvial lake sediments
sustains the view of most geologists that glacio-pluvial
climates of arid America were decidedly colder and
wetter than the present. It is within the postpluvial pe-
riod that the desert grassland pollen chronology fails
to support the climatic interpretations of certain pre-
vious workers, Foremost is lack of pollen evidence of
pluvial conditions at the Sulphur Spring stage type
locality (profile of Double Adobe I).
According to Antevs (151) ''The bones of the
extinct animals, the much greater moisture indicated
by the hickory, the permanent river, and the lakelet
show that ... the beds ... were deposited during the
last Pluvial, the correlative of the last glaciation in
western North America.'' In 1942, Bryan visited the Sul-
phur Spring valley and confirmed Antevs' interpreta-
tion that the alluvial beds of the Sulphur Spring stage
were deposited at a time wetter than the present (27).
But the pollen record of Sulphur Spring stage sediments
bears no resemblance to the pollen of pluvial-age sedi-
ments of the Willcox Playa and makes a pluvial climate
and age virtually impossible.
A second and perhaps more provocative discovery
is the high frequency of moisture indicators including
tree pollen in the middle of the postpluvial pollen rec-
ord. This suggests a moist, not a dry altithermal. It
led me to re-examine the Bryan-Antevs model of post-
pluvial climates which is commonplace in the literature
of Southwestern prehistory. The discord does not in-
volve the Bryan-Antevs älluvial chronology, based on
reasonably secure field evidence of synchronous epi-
sodes of deposition and erosion in Southwestern flood
SEcToN 5,--IDLLUSTRaTIONS OF G EOLOGICAL STRUCTUEE.
It is customary to consult the older and usually the more thoroughly
consolidated stratified rocks for illustration of geological structure, but, as
such feattnnres are in many cases the records of the manner in whichh the
beds were deposited, it is evident that they should occur in thhe newest as
well as the oldest formations. It is well known that the history of the earth
is a continuous record, however fragmentary it may seem at the present
day, and that the processes of nature have been the same throughout thhe
geological ages, Nowhere are these axioms more thoroughly sustained
than in the recently desiccated lake basins of the Far West, As the gravels
and finer sediments deposited in Lake Lahontan afford many instructive
records of the circumstances under which they were accumulated, we have
prepared the following brief summary of observations relating to geologic
structure due to deposition, erosion, etc., believing that it will assist in inter-
preting similar phenomena when observed in older rocks, where they are
frequently obscured by metamorphism and other changes.
STRATIEICATION AND LAMINATION.
The sediments forming the upper and lower portions of the Lahontan
section consist of fine, homogeneous, evenly-stratified marly-clays, which
show a distinct lamination parallel with the planes of bedding. Attention
is called to the lamination of these deposits in connection with other features
due to deposition, as it has manifestly resulted from the slow accumulation
of fine sediments in thin layers, and does not owe its existence to pressure,
as is the case in many older rocks, This is evident since both the upper
and lower clays are alike laminated, while the higher members of the series
at least have never been subjected to the pressure of superimposed deposits,
CURRENT BEDDING.
The gravels separating the upper and lower Lahontan clays are char-
acterized by extreme irregularity, and afford many illustrations of structure
due to deposition, They were deposited in the shallow waters and were
much agitated by waves and currents, and among other features present
and, (ii) that
estimated consumptive use by man for that year was added to
the actual volume, giving an adjusted volume and correspond-
ing surface area. The increase in area was multiplied by the
estimated rate of evaporation to calculate the increase in
evaporation loss. Subtracting this evaporation loss from the
first adjusted volume gave a final adjusted volume and a net
gain in volume for the year equal to man's consumptive use
less the increased evaporation loss. The net gain in volume was
then added to the volume corresponding to the observed mean
elevation for the next year (1852), and the computations were
repeated. The evaporation factor was applied only to the
computed increase in area; the actual evaporation loss from
the total lake surface did not enter into the computations.
Computations for the entire period of record were run on a
digital computer, using a program prepared by E. L. Peck, and
another computation was also run for the period of statehood,
1896--1965. The mean annual elevations of G reat Salt Lake
for the period 1851--1965, adjusted for the computed effects
of man's consumptive use, are plotted along with the observed
elevations in figure 3. Results of the computation for
1896--1965 gave the same adjusted elevation for 1965. The
computed cumulative reduction in lake elevation caused by
consumptive use of water in the drainage basin for the period
1851- 1965 was 5.28 feet.

the group given only a single course. This makes the study especially
valuable, because the time of the split-dose x-ray exposure can be clearly
specified.
On January 1, 1970, the group not re-treated with a second course
numbered 4,420 patients still alive and 1,759 who had died (477 had
emigrated or were otherwise lost to followup). A more extensive report
of this followup has been made available to the Committee (R. Doll
and P. G. Smith, personal communication) and was included in the
1977 uNscEAR report.
UUnfortunately, no radiation-exposure data for these patients have been
published since the original very detailed analysis in 1957. In the
following section, the doses delivered to various tissues in this group
are estimated. We believe that these estimates are valid at least to
within S0%, and they have been used to calculate risk estimates from
the epidemiologic evidence of excess cancers (by site) observed in these
patients.
ESTIMATES OF RADIATION DOSES IN TISSUES AND ORGANS
IN THE SINGLE-COURSE RADIOTHERAPY PATIENTS TREATED
FOR ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS IN ENGLAND AND WALES
The available data on patients with ankylosing spondylitis who received
a single treatment course with x rays in the Doll and Smith study%.'3
were reviewed, to estimate average radiation doses in tissues and organs
giving rise to excess leukemias and cancers of heavily irradiated sites.
It was not possible to review the radiotherapy charts of each patient,
and it was therefore necessary to make assumptions on, for example,
the selection of patients, the extent and severity of disease, the method
of therapy, the radiotherapy dosimetry and exposures, the tissues ir-
radiated, and the doses absorbed. The number of assumptions was kept
to a minimum; it was recognized that the selection of patients and the
clinical courses of treatment chosen by the radiotherapist in individual
cases were, understandably, extremely variable. In spite of these limita-
tions, however, it has been possible to make reasonable assumptions
and to develop a model of what probably occurred in the radiotherapy
planning and treatment of these patients, on the basis of conventional
orthovoltage radiotherapy of the 19304-1950s. The estimates of radiation
doses absorbed thus derived, however, are imprecise and must be further
corrected as new information becomes available, not only with respect
to the assumptions made above, but also with respect to subtle informa-
tion still lacking-for example, on the location of the organ during
treatment and on the fraction of the organ or tissue that was irradiated.

Introduction
The electrochemical nature of corrosion would be only of
ninor or academic interest to the corrosion engineer if it
provided merely an additional rmethod of measuring average
corrosion rate, The standard gravimetric method of weigh-
ing the amount of metal reacted during a specified time can
yield adequate accuracy when good descaling procedures
are used. The gravimetric method is generally satisfactory
and it still widely used in investigating corroding systerms of
industrial importance. Corrosion rate measured by rmetal
weight loss is, however, an average value over a relatively
long reaction time.
The electrochemical nature of corrosion provides a
means of determining an almost instantaneous corrosion
rate. Over the time interval required to obtain a gravirmetric
corrosion rate, one can follow electrochemically how the
rate varies with time, The mean corrosion rate, obtained by
integration of the rate/time curve, should be equal to the
rate obtained by descaled weight loss.
Consider the reaction of iron in sulfuric acid to form
ferrous sulfate:
or by the rate of the cathodic process:
where D is the metal density in g cm '', d day, and y
year,
Unfortunately, one cannot simply hook up an armmeter
to any naturally corroding metal and measure the current
equivalent to the instantaneous corrosion rate, because this
current is internally shorted, There are, however, three
fundamental concepts which can be brougYt into play to
develop electrochemical techniques for measuring corrosion
rate.
Tsfel Equation
Fundamental Concepts
In 1905, Tafel' found that the cuent equivalent to
the rate of a sfnge electrode reaction on a metal surface is
related to the potential of the metal bby
where E is the potential measured with respect to a selected
reference electrode, a and b being constants. The Tafel
equation has been confirmed experimentally for a wide
variety of individual anodic and cathodic reactions. Con-
stants a and b can be predicted theoretically for many
reaction mechanisms,' Foor the purpose of this report, the
Tafel slope, b s dE/d log 1, is considered an experimental
quantity characteristic of a particular anodic process (b,) or
cathodic process (b), not a theoretical quantity calculated
from the reaction model.
Additiviry Principle
A naturally corroding metal always has more than one
electrochemical process occurring on its surface at a
measurable rate, These must include at least one anodic
process and one cathodic. If external current is applied to
the corroding metal to change its potential, the potential
change affects the rates of all electrochemical processes at
the metal surface, This is depicted graphically in Figure 1.
The system represented in Figure 1 it a generalized
corroding metal on which there are three reactions desig-
gted by prine, double prirme, and triple prme, the three
reactions having reversible potentials E,', E,'', and E,''',
The lines represent linear Tafel (E vs iog 1) plots for the
anodc and cathodic processes of each reaction, The current
for any one of these processes is referred to as a partial
current, and it represents the rate of that process.

cracks to be transgranular and Royuela and Staehle
detected both intergranular and transgranular cracking.
There is a clear trend for sasceptibility to cricking to
follow the nickel content regardless of the crystal structure
(ferritic vs austenitic) and alloy base (Fe, FeCr, Fe-Cr-Mn).
The effect of chromium variation on the Fe-Ni base has
not been so extensively studied. The first extensive study
by Denhard? showed that increasing chromium in a
Fe-12Ni base increased its susceptibility to cracking in
boiling MgCl. His data are summarized in Figure 54. A
range of Ni-Cr variations has been studied by both Truman
and Perry' * (10-25 Cr, 15-45 Ni) and Evans and Burm'
(16-35 Cr, 8-41 Ni). These results tend to show a minimum
in cracking generally at 20% Cr with less susceptibility at
higher and lower chromium. The work of Truman and
Perry was more specific with respect to cracking times.
They also investigated MgClg, CaCl,, 3 and 10% NaCl at
250 C, NaCl at 330 C, condensing steam and caustic with
most tests being in tension. Typical results from their work
are summarized in Figure 55. Royuela and Staehle'8' have
investigated the effect of a broad range of chromium and
in the solution annealed (705 C) condition. Steel A was
hardened to Rg 19 by annealing (705 C), air cooling,
austenitizing (982 C), oil quenching and tempering at 649
C, and to R, 34 by tempering at 538 C. Steel B was
hardened to R 18 as above but was tempered at 593 C.
Steel B was tempered at 510 C in order to obtain a hardness
of R, 34. As can be seen from the above tempering
temperatures, the two steels respond to tempering slightly
differently. Likewise, the mechanical properties are some-
what different as can be seen from Table 2. The structures
were fully martensitic when hardened and tempered.
In order to determine whether steels A and B had
different responses to other chemical media and to electro-
chemical polarization, wires were prepared from each steel
and testt were conducted in apparatus resembling van
Rooyen's.' Mediz evaluated (besides 42% boiling MgCl4)
included: dilute HC1 + SeO4, 4iluts H4SO, + SeOg, dilute
aoetic acid + (NH,)YS, boiling 3% NaCl, nd boiling 3%
NaCl + CS4. Although many testt were performed with
anodic, cathodic and no applied currents (at several tensile
loads), only little differences were found in the behavior of
steels A and B-except in MgCl, without applied currents.
Only Steel B appeared ssceptible to stress corrosion
cracking in boiling 42% by weight MgCl; without an
applied current. The environments purported to accelerate
hydrogen embrittlement (such as dilute acetic acid +
(NH,)S) acted more quickly upon Steel A but both steels
did crack, and fracture paths appeared to be very similar. In
fact, the crack path in all environhents, for both steels, was
extremely similar. The cracks follow an.intergranular path
astociated with the prior austenite gains. The one major
exception, it the crack path in Steel B when tested in
boiling 42% MgCl4, either without an applied current or
with anodic polarization. As can be seen from Figures 1, 2,
3, and 4 the cracks have more of a transgrannlar
appearance, as well as much more branching. Figures S and
6 are examples of cracks in other media or under cathodic
polarization.
I believe that these data do show that although the 12%
chromium martensitic steels are susceptible to hydrogen
embrittlement and anodic accelerated cracking, the
presence of 1.76% Ni in the alloy leads to a unique cracking
behavior in boiling 42% MgCl without any applied current.

not only occur at the grain boundaries, but on slip bands
and pearlite lamellae as well, and this causes a renewed
decrease in the time to fracture. In an annealed 0.28% C
steel, Zabik' did not observe such effects. The time to
fracture decreased regularly with increasing load. This was
evidently due to the much lower ductdity of that steel
when compared with low-carbon iron and annealed 0.14%

Concentration vs Boiling Temperature of
Magnesium Chloride Solutions
M. A. Streicher and 1. B. Casale
Introduction
The temperature of boiling magnesium chloride solu-
tions, which are used to detect the susceptibility of stainless
steel alloys to stress corrosion cracking has a pronounced
effect on the measured time to failure. A discrepancy
between the boilingpointconcentration relationship was
brought to our attention when a series of 42 wt % solutions
was prepared in the Engineering Materials laboratory and a
boiling point observed that was apparently low by almost
10 C compared with values often cited in the literature. In
an attempt to resolve this discrepancy, atmospheri4
boilingpoint data were assembled from the literature for
MgCl; solutions in the 0-46 wt % concentration range.
These data were supplemented by new experimental
determinations on 40-46 wt % MgCl, -the concentration
range of greatest interest in stress corrosion tests-for which
little information was available.
The concentration in general use was apparently
proposed by Scheil,' who reported preparing a ''solution
containing approximately 1375 gm of MgCl, - 6H4O and
150 ml H4O boiling at 309 F (154 C)... This solution
contains about 42 wt % MgCl;. Numerous authors''? have
cited this paper and have reported preparing 42 wt % MgCls
solutions with boiling points of 154 C.
In 1961 Barnartt and van Rooyen' called attention to
the inconsistency in the reported boiling point. They
measured a boiling point of 146 C at 730 mm Hg for a 42.5
wt % MgCl;. These data, when corrected to 760 mrm Hg,
yield a value of 147.0 C, in good agreement with data
published by Pershke and Kalinin' in 1932, which plot to

On ramnfall analyses of the 1976 Big Thompson storm for the two
basins are 153 and 110 m'/s (Miller and others, 1978) (Table 6).
Ihese values are also closer to the paleohydraulic values than are
the slope-area estimates. Thus, two independent indirect discharge
cstimates give peak discharge estimates similar to those calculated
by the paleohydraulic technique developed here, but significantly
less than the published conventional slope-area discharge estimates
(Table 6). These results support the suggestion that excessive chan-
nel scour in small mountain tributaries could cause slope-area dis-
charge estimates to be too large.
A second explanation for why most paleohydraulic recon-
Structed discharges on small streams are lower than those estimated
by slope-area techniques may be that slope-area methods require
the estimation of a roughness coefficient (n). Typical values conss-
tently selected for large floods in small mountain channels are n =
0.035 to 0.06. Research on verification of roughness coefficients for
steep mountain channels recently completed (R. D. Jarrett, unpub.
data) indicates that these n values may be too low by factors of 1,5
o 2.0. Higher values would reduce velocities and result in lower
lope-area discharge estimates.
Finally, the fundamental assumptions that particles of all sizes
are avalable for transport in small, steep mountam valleys and that
flood velocty and depth (actually depth-slope product) are
reflected in the suze of boulders in flood deposits must be examned.
lLarge floods may have been able to move boulders larger than
those that were avalable. This may be the case in Sawmill Gulch
(Table 6, site 9), which follows a major shear zone along which
uranium enrchment occurs (Sims and Sheridan, 1964). Fault
movements have crushed and broken the bedrock along closely
Spaced jonts and fractures, and consequently there are no very
large boulders avalable to be moved during a large flood. The
Second assumption, that average velocity and depth can be recon-
Structed from particle size wth reasonable accuracy, requires that
the methods selected, premises, and numertcal values estimated rea-
Sonably approximate processes and conditions in the field. Unfor-
tunately, the hazards entailed in compiling actual measurements
and observations during catastrophic floods preclude any substan-
1al direct emprical corroboration,

while the soil is wet and conductive enough to supply w.iter to the site of
evaporation at a rate commensurate with the evaporative demand. During
this stage, the evaporation rate is limited by, and hence also controlled by,
external meteorological conditions (i.e., radiation, wind, air humidity, etc.)
rather than by the properties of the soil profile. As such, this stage, being
weather controlled, is analogous to the flux-controlled stage of nfiltration (in
contrast with the profile-controlled stage; see Sections B and H, on rain
infiltration, in Chapter 12). The evaporation rate during this stige might also
be influenced by soil surface conditions, including surface reflectivity and
the possible presence of a mulch, insofar as these can modify the cffect of the
meterorological factors acting on the soil. In a dry climate, this stage of
evaporation is generally brief and may last only a few hours to a few days,
(2) An intermediate falling-rate stage, during whch the evaporation
rate falls progressively below the potential rate (the evaporativty). At this
stage, the evaporation rate is limited or dictated by the rate at which the
gradually drying soil profile can deliver moisture toward the evaporation
zone. Hence it can also be called the soil profile-controlled stage. This stage
may persist for a much longer period than the first stage.
(3) A residual slow-rate stage, which is established eventually and which
may persist at a nearly steady rate for many days, weeks, or even months. This
stage apparently comes about after the surface-zone has become so desiccated
that further liquid-water conduction through it effectively ceases. Water
transmission through the desiccated layer thereafter occurs primarily by the
slow process of vapor diffusion, and it is affected by the vapor diffusivity of
the dried surface zone and by the adsorptive forces acting over molecular
distances at the particle surfaces. This stage is often called the tapor difision
stage and can be important where the surface layer is such that it becomes
quickly desiccated (e.g., a loose assemblage of clods).
Whereas the transition from the first to the second stage is generally a
sharp one, the second stage generally blends into the third stage so gradually
that the last two cannot be separated so easily. A qualitative explanation for
the occurrence of these stages follows.
During the initial stage, the soil surface gradually dries out and soil
moisture is drawn upward in response to steepening evaporation-induced
gradients. The rate of evaporation can remain nearly constant as long as the
moisture gradients toward the surface compensate for the decreasing hy-
draulic conductivity (resulting from the decrease in water content). In terms
of Darcy's law, ; = K(d9/dz), we can restate the above principle by noting
that the flux ; remains constant because the gradient d 9 dz increases suffi-
ciently to offset the decrease of K. Sooner or later, however, the soil surface
approaches equilibrium with the overlying atmosphere 'i e. hecomes ap-
proximately air dry). From this moment on, the moisture gradients toward
the surface cannot increase any more, and in fact, must tend to decrease as
for the purposes of those research and other
studies in which no direct benefit to the per-
sons irradiated is intended, in circumstances
when the exposure is unrelated to any illness
they may have, should only be undertaken by
properly qualified and trained persons. Such
irradiation should only be given with the
consent of the authorities in charge of the
institution where the irradiation is to take
place, as advised by an appropriate expert
body and subject to local and national regula-
tions. The estimated risks of the irradiation
should be explained to those involved, who
should be volunteers fully able to exercse
ther free will, The higher the dose the more
rigorous should be the requirements on the
conditions of securing true volunteers and on
ther capablity of understanding the risk. It
follows that the irradiation, for the purposes
of such studies, of chldren and other persons
regarded as being incapable of giving their
true consent should only be undertaken if the
expected radiation dose is low (e.g. of the
order of one-tenth of, the dose-equivalent
limitsapplicable to individual members of the
public)and if valid approval has been given by
those legally responsible for such persons.
The individuals exposed under these condi-
tions obtan no direct benefit from their
exposure and it is therefore necessary to
ensure that their detriment remains accept-
able, and thus to set authorized limits. How-
ever, the magnitude of the detriment associ-
ated with the exposure depends on the age and
the state of health of the exposed individual
and it 1s not possible to fi limits of general
applicability. Appropriate limits should
therefore be authorized for each research
program.
The optimization of exposure
(205) The Commission wishes to re-
emphasize that careful attention totechniques
would, in many cases, result in a considerable
reduction of the dose due to medical proced-
ures, without impairment of their value. In
general, the techniques and equipment used
should allow:
the reduction of the doses received by
tissues in the region of the body under
examination to the minimum compatible
with obtaining the necessary information
in the particular patient;
the delivery to the treated region of the
body of a therapeutic dose the magnitude
of which is most likely to ensure the re-
quired response;
the limitation as far as practicable of the
exposure of other parts of the body.
(206) Because of the risk of radiation injury
to any embryo or foetus, the possblity of
pregnancy is one of the factors to be con-
sidered in deciding whether to make a radio-
logcal examination involving the lower
abdomen in a woman of reproductive
capacity. Although such an examination is
least likely to pose any hazard to a developing

Professional training
(208)The Commission wishes to emphasize
theimportance of including adequate traning
on radiation protection in the general educa-
tion and training of individuals entering the
medical and associated professions, since all
those who enter these professions may be
involved in prescribing procedures involving
exposure to ionizing radiation. More
thorough training in radiation protection is
required by those planning to enter the field of
radiology and by scientists and technicians
assisting in the medical uses of radiation.

Because D(0) typically increases rapidly with increasing ? (e.g. Rose 1968, Reichardt
et al, 1972), 20/?x will be large near x = 0, and small elsewhere in the column, pro-
viding 9 s ,. Hence over most of the column 0 will be approximately uniform,
and the rate of outflow will depend on the rate at which this approximately uniform
0 declines with time. We will now assume that the rate of outflow, F, is given by
Vg?, where Y is the volume of the soil and Q is -? lt which we will take to be effec-
tively independent of x, but not of 1. This is tantamount to saying that, apart from
near x == 0, the sshape of the (x) curve is approximately constant. It should remain
so until ? approaches , when D varies little with x, and Doering's (1965) method
(which is based on a constant D) becomes valid. That the above assumption is a
reasonable one is illustrated in Fig. 2, which shows 2/?t (normalized with respect to
dö/dt) as a function of xfL and the mean water content @. The curves were obtained
by numerically solving equation (1) subject to (2) with D an exponential function of

traverse. The boundaries then were projected directly
from the photogrsphs onto the topogrsphic base maps.
Mapping of the grsvel fans involved sufficient trs-
verses on each fan to identify the gravel deposits ac-
cording to their distinctive color and tone on the aerial
photogrsphs. The boundaries of the seversl formstions
then were sketched with much generalization on the
photographs, and these lines were transferred by pro-
jeotion and inspection to the topogrsphic base. In gen-
eral, the boundaries of the older of the lste Pleistocene
gravel (No. 2 grsvel) are shown by the contours; the
younger grsvels commonly sre in such small areas that a
grest deal of generalizatios was necessary, so much so
that accurste projection onto the topogrsphic base
seemed an overrefinement.
The lower parts of the mountains were mapped on
the ground. For the most part the trsverses were
along the valleys and along the ridges, although this is
at right angles to the contacts. The higher parts of
the mountains were mapped by helicopter. Within
limits, this mapping from the air could be checked by
tracing the formations to the lower parts of the moun-
tains where mapping had been done on the ground and
where fossil collections had helped control it. Later,
some of the most questionable aress were checked by
traverses down the ridges snd canyons from the summit
of the Panamint Range to the ffoor of Death Valley.
In the course of mapping the Paleozoic formations,
about 100 collections of fossils were obtained. Their
locations are shown on the geologic map, snd the con-
tents of most of the collections are described with the
formations. It is espected that future work will show
that the formations in some fauhL blocks have been in-
correctly identified, but the fossil collections show the
limits to which such corrections may be exstended.
Fieldwork was interrupted while parts of the study
still were incomplete. In particular, the Tertiary for-
mations, the grsnitic intrusions, and the older of the
Precambrisn sedimentary formations need more study.

Figure 14.--Graph showing phenocrysts and lithic variations in the tuff of Lithic Ridge.
Bedded and Ash-Flow Tuff
The tuff of Lithic Ridge is underlain by approximately 13 m of tuffaceous
sediments, with a thin (approximat@ly 9 m) ash-flow tuff intercalated with the
tuffaceous sediments. This thin ash-flow tuff is very light gray to light
greenish gray, partially welded, and contains 15-20 percent phenocrysts. The
phenocrysts consist of plagioclase, biotite, and sparse sanidine and quartz.
The ash flow apparently has the same phenocryst composition (table 6) and
probably correlates with a thin ash- flow tuff that is present in USW G-1 at
1656-1661 m (F. M. Byers, lr., oral comun., 1982). This thin ash flow in USW
G-1 is the uppermost ash flow of unit C, wnich is the lowest unit of the
''older ash-flow and bedded tuffs'' of USW G-1 (Spengler and others, 1982).
Unit C is approximately 173 m thick in USW G-1, and thins drastically north of
the USW G-1 drill site. No other units of the ''older ash-flow and bedded
tuffc'' of USW G-1 were identified in USW G-2.
these units are left informally designated as the red
sandstone unit in White Basin and east of Frenchman
Mountain, and as the rocks of the Grand Wash trough
in the Grand Wash area, throughout this report.
The Hualapai Limestone presents a special nomen-
clature problem because it is commonly called a formal
member of the Muddy Creek Formation in recent liter-
ature (Blair, 1978; Blair and Armstrong, 1979; and Luc-
chitta, 1972, 1979). Its member status is chiefly based
upon the fact that limestone is interbedded with red
sandstone at the base of the main body of Hualapai
Limestone at Grapevine Mesa, and the red sandstone
has traditionally been termed Muddy Creek. In this
report, however, the red sandstone that is interbedded
with the limestone of the Hualapai is considered to be
part of the rocks of the Grand Wash trough rather than
part of the Muddy Creek. On this basis, it is better to
refer to the Hualapai as part of the rocks of the Grand
Wash trough rather than as a member of the Muddy
Creek. However, the Hualapai extends to the west of
Grapevine Mesa beyond the western limits of the under-
lying red sandstone, where it rests directly on Precam-
brian crystalline rocks. It ultimately extends into
Detrital Valley, where it rests on rocks called Muddy
Creek Formation. Because the stratigraphic relations of
the Hualapai with the Muddy Creek in Detrital Valley
are incompletely understood owing to a paucity of pub-
lished maps and accurate descriptions there, and be-
cause the Hualapai interfingers with informally named
rocks in the Grand Wash trough, it is left unassociated
with either the rocks of the Grand Wash trough or the
Muddy Creek; it is restored here to its original forma-
tional rank (Longwell, 1936) and referred to simply as
the Hualapai Limestone.
The Muddy Creek Formation of Stock (1921) is
slightly reevaluated in this report in that the use of that
term is restricted somewhat. Only rocks that can be
demonstrated to have been stratigraphically continuous
with those of the Muddy Creek type locality are called
Muddy Creek Formation.
AGE OF THE TERTIARY ROCKS
The precise age of the Tertiary nonmarine sedimen-
tary rocks in the Lake Mead region has been poorly doc-
nented largely because fossils are rare to nonexistent,
md because some important unconformities were not
ietected. Although Anderson and others (1972) report
!4 K-Ar determinations from igneous rocks associated
vith the nonmarine sedimentary rocks, the authors did
ot agree among themselves (Anderson and others,
,972, p. 283) that the age determinations were repre-
wentative of the age of the sedimentary rocks. The
disagreement focused upon whether the ages were
determined from lava flows interbedded with the sedi-
mentary rocks or from younger shallow intrusive rocks,
and on whether or not the dates from demonstrated ex-
trusive rocks were reset by thermal effects from nearby
intrusive rocks. Several additional factors must be con-
sidered concerning the dates presented by Anderson
and others (1972). The lower part of the section was
never dated by them, even in Rainbow Gardens, and
they still considered it to be possibly Cretaceous in age.
Also, saline minerals present throughout the Horse
Spring Formation suggest that the associated ground
water was capable of altering volcanic rocks' and of
subsequently chemically adjusting the apparent K-Ar
ages. In addition, the ages reported by Anderson and
others (1972) were grouped and referred to in terms of
the confusing system of stratigraphic nomenclature in
existence at the time and they, therefore, must be
reevaluated in the light of newly documented strati-
graphic relations.
Twenty-five fission-track age determinations were
made on zircon extracted from basal tuff beds inter-
preted to be of air-fall origin interbedded with the other
Tertiary sedimentary rocks. The fission-track dating
method was chosen for several reasons: zircon is pres-
ent, is not susceptible to alteration, and has a high
resistance to track annealing upon heating. Also,
fission-track dating of zircon, which is rich in uranium,
works especially well in Tertiary rocks. The age-
determination procedure follows that of Naeser (1976),
and lab work was done in Naeser's lab under his
guidance.
Two important assumptions must be made when eval-
uating fission-track age determinations as primary
ages. It must be assumed that the dated rock has not
endured a heating event later than its original forma-
tion, or that it has not undergone a prolonged cooling
history. Also, it must be assumed that the dated grains
are not detrital and have had the same thermal history
as the encompassing rock. The inferred airfall origin
and the limited stratigraphic thickness of the dated
tuffs suggest that they have not undergone a slow cool-
ing history, and their mineralogy indicates that they
have not been postdepositionally heated beyond the
annealing temperature of zircon. Naeser iwritten com-
munication, 1978) has demonstrated that the approx-
imate annealing temperature of zircon through geologic
time is about 175-200 C, The presence of both heu-
landite' and analcime in the dated tuffs suggests that
most widespread, and the stromatolitic mound sub-
facies, which apparently occurs only in the upper one-
fourth of the member in Lovell Wash. A conglomeratic
lithofacies, also exposed in Lovell Wash, is the southern
stratigraphic equivalent of the stromatolitic mound
subfacies, and it is distributed near large faults. Near
Lava Butte the Bitter Ridge consists of sandstone and
intraformational breccia, which are grouped with the
conglomerate as the clastic lithofacies.
Both subfacies of the stromatolitic limestone appear
to have originated as sediment in a lacustrine environ-
ment. The tabular nature of the member; the parallel,
continuous bedding; and the fine, uniform laminations
of the wavy-bedded subfacies support the lacustrine
origin. A lacustrine environment provides the even,
widespread surface necessary to develop such bedding,
whereas few other nonmarine environments could. Ap-
parently the lake was relatively free of detrital influx,
because the limestone contains only widely dispersed
grains of siliceous clastic material and no sand-sized
Ammonia Tanks near the apex of the Timber Mountain
resurgent dome (fig. 18). The pipes are localized along the
faulted margin of a northwest-trending central graben,
described by Carr and Quinlivan (1968, p. 105). The
central parts of the pipes are light gray and devitrified,
whereas the border zones are generally glassy or finely
spherulitic. In a few places a crystallized transitional
border zone as much as 15 m (50 ft) wide contains
alternating bands of rhyolite having different phenocryst
contents and probably represents a zone of intermixed
intrusive high-silica rhyolite and remobilized quartz latite
wallrock of the Ammonia Tanks Member. The modal
range of three specimens and the silica content of 76.8
percent approach the composition of a typical high-silica
rhyolite of the Ammonia Tanks Member (fig. 21).
The inferred relations among the Ammonia Tanks
Member in the Timber Mountain resurgent dome, the
petrologically related intrusives, and an inferred under-
lying compositionally zoned magma chamber are shown
in figure 22. The two-layer compositional zoning of the
upper part of a large magma chamber is based on models
suggested by Quinlivan and Lipman (1965), by Lipman.
Christiansen, and O'Connor (1966), and by Smith and
Bailey (1966). The inward-dipping tuff dikes formed from
high-silica rhyolite magma near the apical part of the
magma chamber and are somewhat analogous to cone
sheets (Anderson, 1936). The rhyolite intrusives of East

INTRODUCTION
Detailed knowledge of the pattern of intraplate stress pro-
vides important constraints on models of global tectonic proc-
esses and the mechanism of plate motions. On a finer scale,
both the pattern of stress and variations in the pattern must be
known to understand intraplate volcanism and tectonism
properly. In addition, in regions of relative tectonic quies-
cence, knowledge of the in situ stress field is required for de-
lineation of potential seismic hazards associated with pre-
existing zones of weakness in the crust.
This study represents an attempt to map the modern stress
field (primarily Quaternary in the western United States and
Tertiary and younger in the East) in the conterminous United
States. Principal stress orientations have been determined
from geologic observations, earthquake focal mechanisms,
and in situ stress measurements. An attempt has also been
made to categorize broad regions not only by the orientations
of the principal stresses but also by their relative magnitudes,
aS inferred from currently active tectonism.
Data are presented in terms of the orientation and relative
magnitude of maximum and minimum horizontal stresses and
a vertical stress. We have assumed that one principal stress is
vertical, and the horizontal components of the in situ stress
field represent principal stresses. Evidence supporting this as-
sumption includes observations of the nearly vertical attitude
of dikes exposed over significant depth intervals at a given lo-
cality [R. B. Johnson, 1961] as well as the absence of exposed
dikes that appear not to have been emplaced vertically (D.
Pollard, oral communication, 1980). In addition, measure-
ments of the complete stress tensor in deep mines [McGarr
and Gay, 1978] and the near-borizontal orientations of the
great majority of stress axes inferred from earthquake focal
mechanisms also indicate that regionally the principal stresses
are horizontal and vertical.
The major contribution of the present study is the inclusion
of new geologic data on the orientation of the stress field,
largely in the western United States. In addition, we have at-
tempted to go back to the original references and check the re-
liability of previously compiled data, particularly for focal
mechanisms. We have excluded poorly constrained points and
have relied, whenever possible, on averages of a number of so-

heater approximating an ideal line source is placed
along the longitudinal axis of a 5.1-cm-dia, by
10.2-cm-long sample. A thermocouple is attached and
soldered to the heater at midsample. The entire probe
assembly is 'potted'' in place with a mixture of ceram-
ic cement and powdered copper to minimize and
standardize contact resistance between probe and
sample. Disks of low-conductivity ceramic insulator
are used to minimize heat loss from the ends of the
sample. Such heat losses, if unchecked, would lead to
anomalously high apparent conductivities. The over-
all internal heater length, 13.4 cm, gives a heater
length-to-diameter (L/D) ratio of 36. The L/D ratio
within the sample itself is 32. The sample-probe as-
sembly is separated from the confining fluid by a
teflon sleeve.
Power, in the form of carefully monitored and
controlled voltage and current, is applied to the probe
heater for periods of 2 min, while the exterior of the
sample is maintained at constant pressure and nearly
constant temperature (T c1%C). Because the exteri-
or temperature of the sample does not change signifi-
cantly during the period of the test, a sample of finite
dimension behaves as if it were inifinite in volume.
Thermal conductivity for the material is calculat-
ed from the internal heater temperature history and

gORPHOMETRIC STUDIES OF FRESH CINDER CONES
Cinder cone dimensions have been studied systematically only in the last
years. In this paper the terminology of Porter (1972) is used, with W,,
Hone basal diameter; W, ** crater diameter; H, cone height;s * cone slope
ingle (Fig. 2). The depth of a crater can be readily modified during or after
n eruption (at Paricutin the depth changed from 140 m to 30 m to 100 m
over a 28-day period in late 1946; Wilcox, 1947) and often is less than the
eontour interval of maps used for measurement; therefore, the depth of the
grater is not used as a descriptive parameter. In order to relate cinder cone
hhorphology to eruption conditions,I use only relatively fresh cones in the
statistical comparisons. Fresh cones are generally distinguished by a lack of
vegetation and gullying on their flanks, have well-defined circular outlines,
gnd frequently an abrupt change in slope occurs where the cone meets the
surrounding ground surface.

Cone diameter distribution
The distribution of basal diameters (W,,) for 910 cinder cones in the fol-
$$owing areas: San Francisco volcanic field, Arizona; Mauna Kea, Hawaii;
Nunivak Island, Alaska; Kilimanjaro, Tanzania; Etna, Italy; and Paricutin,
Mexico is shown in Fig. 3, compiled from data supplied by Settle (1979,
And personal communication ). Although both degraded and fresh cones are
fhcluded in this sample, the results are considered reasonably representative
of the diameter spectrum of terrestrial cinder cones. Cinder cone diameters
rnge from 0.25 km to about 2.5 km with a mean of about 0.9 km and a me-
dian of 0.8 km. By contrast, the few spatter cones whose diameters are re-
9orted in the literature are generally less than 0.l km across at their bases.
Maars are somewhat larger than cinder cones, with W;, averaging 0.7-0.8 km
(Wood, in preparation), and composite (strato-) volcanoes are much larger,
with basal diameters averaging 8 km (Wood, 1978).
,With a basal diameter of 0.13 km, the Reunion cone Cratere Ducrot is
naller than all of the 910 cones in Fig. 3. The small diameter is consistent
ith the interpretation that the Reunion cones are more like spatter cones
tan cinder cones. The other three cones discussed in the previous section

FULL-WAVE ACOUSTIC LOG
The log on the left of Figure 1 illustrates one of the more recent geophysical
logs to be offered by the commercial logging companies. It is a full-wave
acoustic log. The log shown is a Birdwell log which this company offers under
the commercial name 3-D (Bird, 1965). In essence it is a recording of the
sonic wave train for a period of time displayed as a variable intensity record-
ing, Whereas the sonic log shown in Figure 1 is essentially a recording of the
time of first arrival of a sonic pulse through the rock at some fixed sender-to-
receiver distance (which is displayed as the time through the rock divided by
the distance of travel or the reciprocal velocity), the 3-D log is a record of
the wave train for some time after the first arrival. The dynamic elastic moduli
of the medium can be calculated from this log when used in conjunction with
a density log. These moduli are Young's modulus, shear modulus, bulk mod-
ulus, and Poisson's ratio.
The full-wave recording logs offer the first opportunity to obtain dynamic
elastic moduli on a sufficiently small scale to allow comparisons to be made
with core data. Such comparisons indicate that significant relationships exist
among the acoustic properties of volcanic rocks.

Fuoride showed essentially no variation from March
through June, and so analysis for fluoride was even-
tually discontinued.
A few samples were also analyzed for cations using
a Spectrospan III A DC argon plasma spectrophoto-
meter (table 21). The values are tentative because a
rigorous determination of cross interferences has not
been completed.
DISCUSSION
CHANGES IN SULFUR AND CHLORIDE
The S:Cl ratio increased steadily during the numer-
ous small ash eruptions from March 28 to May 18
(fig. 146). From May 18 on, only ash from the major
eruptions (May 18, May 25, June 12, July 22, and
August 7) was analyzed. These later samples showed
no consistent pattern. This contrasts with data for
Fuego Volcano, Guatemala, where S:Cl ratios cor-
relate with intensity of eruption (Rose, 1977),
Amounts of leachable SO, and Cl on the ash varied
greatly even for products of a single eruption,
although sulfate concentrations remained approxi-
mately 2 times that of chloride, prior to May 18 (also
noted by Rose (1977) Hor Fuego Volcano). Variation
of S:Cl was greater after May 18, as shown by the
May 18 and June 12 samples. Samples of the ash
erupted on June 12, collected in Vancouver, Wash.
(S:C1=0.13), are distinctly different from samples col-
lected on the flanks of Mount St. Helens (S:C1= 1.18
and 0.89). The analytical procedures cannot account
for the large spread in the data. The variations are
possibly due to changes in gas composition during
eruption, meteorologic conditions, or variations in
chemical and physical processes of the eruption.
Data presented by Rose (1977) and Noguchi and
Kamiya (1963) showed a significant increase in S:CI
before a major eruption and a significant decrease
after a major eruption (or series of eruptions).
AIthough a gradual increase occurred before the
May 18 eruption, it was smaller than expected, prob-
ably because magma had already risen in the volcano
and was emitting magmatic gases before the earliest
sampled ash eruptions. Likewise, no significant
decrease has been seen in S:Cl between May 18 and
August 7. The patterns of gas ratios observed
elsewhere suggest that more eruptions are possible
until the S:Cl ratio decreases.

column collapse or expansion from the base of a ris-
ing column, At Mount St. Helens, the ''classic-surge''
environment was merely a transient waning phase
trailing the violent frontal part of the pyroclastic den-
sity flow.
The pyroclastic density flow at Mount St. Helens
was similar to classic surges in its relatively low den-
sity and its capacity to flow over ridges with only
modest regard for topography. This event differs
from classic surges in its size: the potential energy of
the flow as it began its descent off the mountain was
much greater than that of previously described
surges, and accordingly the maximum grain size and
other sedimentologic parameters of its deposits repre-
sent higher energy states than ever before observed
for analogous processes.

250 km east of Mount St. Helens, to the western
border of Idaho and to some undetermined distance
beyond, the ash blanket consists of unit 1 and the
thicker unit 3. Farther downwind, in western Mon-
tana, only a single light-gray layer was deposited. The
basal unit may have pinched out or, more likely, the
two layers have merged owing to mixing downwind.
The pronounced distal thickening of ash in the
vicinity of Ritzville, Wash. (figs. 336, 339), is caused
by the thickening of unit 3. Unit 1 also may have a
distal thickness maximum between 400 and 500 km
downwind along the lobe axis. This distal thickening
of unit 1 may correlate with a high in bulk density
and mean-grain diameter (fig. 339) at about the same
distance.
The dark ash (unit 1) began to fall considerably
before the light-colored ash (unit 3). At Spokane,
Wash., the advancing ash cloud became visible about
1400, ash started falling about 1543, and daylight was
noticeably obscured about 1545 (Paul Weis, written
commun., 1980). Satellite photographs, however, in-
dicate that the ash front passed over Spokane about
2 hr before the cloud was visible to the ground
observer, except for a sun halo that appeared about
1215. This time difference suggests that the front of
the ash cloud was diffuse. Similarly, dark ash fell at
Pullman, Wash., from about 1400 until about 1615.
when light-colored ash began to fall. The light-
colored ash continued to fall until about 0200 on May
19 (Hooper and others, 1980). On the north-south
traverse through Moscow, Idaho, the axis of the dark
layer is about 40 km south of the axis of the light-
colored layer (fig. 340); this difference suggests that
deposition for each layer occurred under somewhat
different wind conditions. At Missoula, Mont., ash
fall began about 2000-2030, some 3l to 3i hr after the
front passed, but near the north end of the traverse,
ash fall began between 2100 and 2200, about 3] to 4]
hr after the front passed. Both in eastern Washington
and in western Montana, 2 hr or more elapsed bet-
ween the passage of the ash-cloud front and the start
of ash fall on the ground. The delay was greater on
the north side of the plume than on the south side.
We compared the isochron map, which shows the
approximate shape and areal dimensions of the
airborne-ash plume, with the isomass map, which
shows the minimum areal and mass distribution of
the ash on the ground (fig. 341). The ash lobe on the
ground is offset to the north relative to the position of
the airborne plume. This northward shift of the air-
Fall lobe relative to the position of the airborne plume
is a result of different wind directions with altitude.
Much of the ash deposited from central Washington
to western Montana was probably carried in the high-
velocity (60-125 km/hr) wind layer at altitudes of
about 10-13 km (fig. 335). This layer was transpor-
ting ash towards azimuths 093%-101' (1020 PDT at
Spokane according to U.S. National Meteorological
Service). By 1600, these high-velocity winds had
shifted northeastward, toward azimuths 079-087%
(fig. 335). This shift in wind direction apparently is
the cause of the axis of the earlier, dark ash being off-
set to the south of the axis of the later, light-colored
ash (fig. 340). During late morning and afternoon of
May 18, however, the slower low-level wind was
consistently more northeastward than was the high-
level wind. At Spokane, velocities of low-level winds
at altitudes 2,250-5.300 m were 30-60 km/hr. At
1020 they were toward azimuth 005%-070%, and at
1600 toward azimuth 048%-070?, These vectors
10%-90 north of the high-level wind vectors explain
why the ash fell on the ground north of the observed
airborne-ash plume.

vergence rate and accelerated absolute North American plate motion
toward the western trench. The trend of the western North American
plate margin relative to the absolute motion of the plate also may have
affected the subsequent igneous and tectonic history along the Cordillera.
Palinspastic restorations of western United States at the beginning of the
Cenozoic by Hamilton and MIyers (1966), Hamilton (1969), and .rm-
strong and Suppe (1973) account for variable amounts of Late Cenozoic
extension in the Basin and Range province. The effect of these restora-
tions (fig. 9) is that the continental margin between the latitude of Las
Vegas and the California-Oregon border trends approximately north-
south. To the north, along Oregon and Washington, the continental
margin trends north by northeast. To the south, thhe trend of the con-
tinental margin is to the southeast, and the margin again chhanges to a
north by northwest direction along Mexico (Karig and [ensky, 1972).
Eastward shift in loci of Early Cenozoic magmatic centers is gradual
along the British Columbia to Wyoming arc trend and is most pro-
nounced in the central Rocky Mountains of Colorado (fig. 3). The
Colorado locus is directly east of the north-south trending California
margin and is northeast of the southeast trending southern California
margin (fig. 9). From the subduction model, we would predict that the
Further circumstantial evidence for the volcanic vcnting of granitic magma
chambers comes from interpretations of the large collapse calderas that form
around the feeder systems for many rhyolitic ash-flow or ignimbrite sheets
[Smith, 1960]. The calderas at the suriace may be linked directly to cauldron-
subsidence structures beneathh, hence some associatcd ring-dike complexcs muy
fill roughly concentric arrays of reluated fault fissures, and the rhyolitic ignim-
brite eruptions may signal partial evacuation of subjaccnt granitic 1magma cham-
bers having the dimensions of stocks and small batholiths. Ilamilton [ 1969a, b]
notes that the Andean ignimbrites arc typically more silicic than most major
batholiths, as would be expected if the uppper levels of a differentiating magma
body were lost by eruption through vents in the roof. He infers that an elongate
granitie batholith belt of Cenozoic age probably lies unexposed at modest depths
beneath the curvilinear volcanic field of rhyolitic and andesitic extrusives along
the crest of the Andes. A Crctaccous analog may be prescnt in Japan, where
granitie intrusives and rhyolitic extrusives of roughhly the sam)e ages are widely
exposed in the same broad region of western Honshu [Miyashiro, 1967, pp. CC2-
423; Ichikawa et al., 1968].
ORIGINS OF ANDESITIC ROC KS
Theories for the origin of andesitic magmas fall into thrce muin cntegories:
1. Primary mantle melts or derivative melts formed by differentiation of
primary basaltie mantle melts
2. Primary crustal melts or derivative melts formed by crustal contamina-
tion of primary basaltic mantle melts
3. Melts, or their derivativcs, formed from either the crustal or the mantle
parts of lithosphere descending along inclined seismic zones
Either the first two or the last two could conceivably opcrate in conjunc-
tion, as rising magmas react with rocks at shallower levels and introduce heat
nto shallower regions.
Derivation From Mantle Parents or Melts
Presently permissible variants of the first type of theory are unacceptably
iiverse. Possible sequences of melting and crystallization within the mantle at
iifferent pressure levels are complex, and varied alternate gcochemical frac-
ionation patterns of crystal residua or accumulates and liquid residua or dif-
erentiates are conceivable [O'Hara, 1965]. The geochemical properties of a
nantle-derived lava that reaches the surface reflect conditions of temperature
und pressure at the highest level of equilibration between melt and some refrac-
ory or accumulative crystalline residuum that remains at depth. Even if the
:rupted lava is primitive in the sense that it has not undergone contamination
xr differentiation at crustal levels, its composition does not necessarily resemble
:losely that of the liquid that formed at the site of initial fusion deep in the
nantle. To a first approximation, the changes that the magma undergoes during
ts rise through the mantle are masked fromm our direct view, as it were, by the
place at a relatively high strain rate and locally produced strong stratal rota-
tions and closely spaced normal faults, the faults themselves being rotated to
relatively low dips. In those areas where extreme regional erosion, coupled
with continuous isostatic rise, has been at play for 5 to 10 m.y. (as in the
Sonoran Desert section), these structures (as noted above) are found to termi-
nate downward at large-scale, subhorizontal detachment surfaces or zones of
extreme cataclasis and/or ductile shear, some of which developed prior to the
onset of extension (Compton et al 1977, Coney 1979, Davis &Coney 1979,
Davis et al 1979, Rehrig et al 1980). While the ductile flow of these rocks in
some places clearly predated the initiation of extension, temperatures during
the extensional episode were sufficiently high to reset radiometric clocks and,
in other places, apparently remained high from the time of compression to the
time of extension.
Role and Origin of Large-Scale Detachment Surfaces
Initiation and maintenance of horizontal shear at the level of such detachments
probably stemmed from increased shear stress, owing to reduction in lateral
support in the shallow crust--the result of thermal expansion, uplift (and the
related increase in surface area that such uplift brings because of a local,
incremental increase in earth radius), and lithospheric extension at depth. It
was further served by a lowered shear strength, stemming from (a ) the pres-
ence of zones of strong anisotrophy, inhomogeneity, and stress concentration
that were created by earlier episodes of compressional thrusting and decol-
lement, as well as by mechanical layering, particularly the presence of ductile
layers within, at the base of, and below the sedimentary pile that thins against
the massive buttress of the North American craton to the east; and (b) high
pore pressure at the base of the brittle faulted column, its presence reflected
in a compressional wave velocity inversion and elevated electrical conduc-
tivity (Eaton 1980). At deeper levels, beneath the reheated mylonites or
metamorphic rocks that underlie the normal faults (and across which a strong,
shear stress gradient existed), extension is believed to have taken place by
inhomogeneously distributed, uniform flow, the result of thermal pre-
weakening of the lithosphere by repeated magmatic invasion. Known zones of
inherited compressional decollement originated in pre-Tertiary time and early
Tertiary time, but crustal temperatures high enough for extensional flow at
natural strain rates, even at shallow lithospheric levels, apparently were main-
tained from the time of compression until at least mid-Cenozoic time when
brittle extension, basaltic volcanism, regional uplift, and, locally, erosion and
rapid cooling began.
Rheological Considerations

and one of possible remobilized uniform flow by steady-state creep at depth,

When outdoors in the winter, one becomes
well aware of the chilling effects of wind. When
the temperature is at freezing (32*F). a 25 mile
per hour wind has a chilling effect equivalent to
zero temperature. When the temperature is zero,
a 10 mile per hour wind has a chilling effect
equivalent to -22'F, and a 25 mile per hour wind
has a chilling effect equivalent to --45*F. Wind
chill below --32*F causes freezing of exposed
human flesh, depending on one's circulation and
physical activity. With wind chill temperatures
much below that, survival efforts may be re-
quired. As long as the temperature is above 10'F,
only gales are dangerous. When the temperature
is zero, there is danger of flesh becoming frozen
if exposed to a 15 mile per hour wind. When the
temperature is -15'F a wind velocity of 10 miles
per hour can be dangerous. At temperatures
much below that, it is probably best to remain
indoors by the fireside.
Climatic differences between the Atlantic and
Pacific coasts illustrate the effect of wind. Be-
cause of the prevailing westerly winds, the Pa-
cific Coast has a marine climate with cool sum-
mers and mild winters, while the Atlantic coast
has a continental climate with hot summers and
cold winters. Hawaii and Puerto Rico are in trop-
ical latitudes, but are cooled by the northeast
trade winds,
Violent Weather and
Other Climatic Hazards
Every part of the continent is subject to occa-
sional combinations of conditions that produce
extreme weather, The result may be a record-
breaking hot or cold spell, a drenching downpour
and Pliocene time that cut off the headwaters of
the Little Colorado River (see p. 458).
The faulting that outlined the mountain ranges
and basins apparently began in early or middle
Tertiary time, as it did in the Great Basin. There
was faulting before the deposition of the Santa
Fe and other late Tertiary formations along the
Rio Grande, but these formations were involved
in later movements along the faults (Fig. 16.10.A).
Some volcanism occurred about this time also.
The faulting here seems to have ceased earlier
than it did in the Salton Trough, Mojave Desert,
and Great Basin, as is suggested by the integra-
tion of the drainage and the scarcity of fresh fault
scarps. However, the belt of earthquake epi-
centers that extends northward along the Rio
Grande Valley (Fig. 2.17) suggests that earth
movement is still going on.
Along its northern boundary, the Mexican
Highland Section grades into the Colorado Pla-
teau, both structurally and topographically. In
New Mexico, the northern part of the Highland
is a block-faulted lava plateau that grades north-
ward into the lava-covered Datil Section of the
Colorado Plateau. The relationship is very simi-
lar to that along the northern edge of the Great
Basin, where block-faulted lavas grade north-
ward into the lava-capped plateaus there.
In Arizona, the northern boundary of the
Highland is a dissected escarpment of Precam-
brian rocks capped by Paleozoic formations and
Tertiary lavas, The escarpment is several thou-
sand feet high, faces south, and extends 500 miles
from the Colorado River to the Rio Grande Val-
ley. The escarpment has acted as a structural
hinge along which the country lying to the south
has alternately been bent upward and downward
relative to the country to the north. The country
south of the escarpment was structurally lower
than the country to the north during Early Creta-
ceous time. It was higher during late Cretaceous
times and again during early and middle Tertiary
time, when gravels were shed northward onto the
Colorado Plateau. Today it is lower (Fig. 16.11).

North of the Yukon Basin is the Brooks Range,
which reaches altitudes of more than 8,000 feet
at its eastern extreme near the Mackenzie River

tude in the west, where it marks the boundary
between a Mesozoic miogeosyncline on the north
and a geanticline on the south. The Mesozoic
formations thicken greatly northward from the
mountains to the coast. Uplift of these old rocks
formed the Brooks Range during Tertiary and
Ouaternary time. This uplift is separated from
that at the Seward Peninsula by the Ouaternary
Selawik Basin.

Both areas of eugeosynclinal rocks were visited
by us in the spring of 1966. A brief reconnaissance
of the Garlock Formation had been made previously
by Ketner, using Dibblee's (1952) map and litho-
logic data. The rocks in Pilot Knob Valley had been
noted during earlier reconnaissance mapping by
Smith (in Jennings, Burnett, and Troxel, 1962). A
striking similarity between the two statigraphic
sections was evident, and subsequent work was
aimed at testing the degree of similarity. Data on
the Garlock Formation presented here are chiefly
from the reports by Dibbiee (1952, p. 15-19; 1967,
p. 27-28 and 34-85) and Christiansen (1961), sup-
plemented by results of the short inspection
described above and a few iater visits for study of
specific rock units. ilata on the metasedimentary
rocks in Pilot Knob 'alley presented in this paper
were collected by Smith during 6 days' additional
geologic fieldwork and suioseouent study of about 40
specimens in the laboratory.
The metasedimentary rocks in Pilot Knob Valley
crop out 2 to 8 miies south of the Garlock fault as
isolated smail hills, .50 to 400 feet high, that pro)
ect through the alluvium. Because the outcrops lie
within a U.S. Navy testing range, fieldwork was
minimal and had to be done on weekends, some-
times with a military escort. The work consisted of
delineating the extent of metasedimentary rocks
and traversing the best-exposed sections. On eachh
traverse, the planimetric width of each separable
lithologic unit was measured by pace, and the pace
distance and lithologic description of each recorded
on a portable tape recorder to be transcribed later.
The traverses totaled about 16,000 feet. The pace
distances were obviously approximate, and most
rock descriptions are based only on criteria that
could be applied in the field. The measured trav-
erses described in table 1 and shown on figure 3 are
not stratigraphic sections in the conventional sense.
Not enough time was available to make reliable geo-
logic maps of the areas composed of these rocks;
and the many faults and small-scale folds observed
along the traverse lines, though not shown on figure

confidence one could have in stratigraphic sections
made without geologic maps. Furthermore, the

This report-Major Tar Sand and Heavy Oil
Deposits of the United States-addresses four
irmportant national energy resource objectives:
(1) to develop an updated assessment of U.S.
tar sand resources;(2)to independently appraise
the major tar sand deposits having 10O million
or more barrels in-place;(3)to document, using
previously published data, the minor tar sand
deposits, with between 1C and 10O million barrels
in-place; and,(4)to tabulate the nation's heavy
oil deposits.
BACKGROUND
The need for this report has grown with each
passing year since the last ''official'' tabulation
of UU.S. tar sands, the 1965 Department of Inter-
ior/Bureau of Mines Monograph 12 entitled,
Surfaceand Shallou Oil-lmpregnated Rocks of the
LUnited States, That reportwas conducted under
the auspices of the Interstate Oil Compact Com-
mission as was this report.
Much has changed in the domestic energy
picture in the intervening twenty years since the
publishing of Monograph 12. Allofthese changes
have added importance to better understanding
and developing,(where economically feasible),
the large and valuable hydrocarbon resources
locked in U.S. tar sand deposits, It is the hope
of the staff, reviewers, and directors of this
study that this collection of information will
help industrial and public managers make more
judicious and timely decisions about the domestic
tar sand and heavy oil resources.
MAJOR FINDINGS
The four major findings of this study are:
1. The Total U.S. Tar Sand Resource is
Estimated at 54 Billion Barrels. The measured
U.S. tar sand resource in-place for major deposits
isestimated at 22 billion barrels. The speculative
resource in-place for major deposits is estimated
at 31 billion barrels. The minor deposits contain
1.0billion barrels of speculative tar sand resource
in-place. Not addressed by this study is the
offshore California area where tar sand/heavy
oil deposits are presumed to exist, but for which
data are not yet obtainable.
The tar sand resource estimate for the U.S. is
shown by state on Figure l (see page 2) and on
the following table. The distribution of tar sand
by state and resource category is shown on
Figure 2 (see page s).
tar sand resource is 11.9 billion barrels,
and the speculative resource is S.2 billion
barrels.
The tar sand resource estimate for California
is 4,7 billion barrels; expansions in the
size of previously identified deposits, the
identification of new deposits, and the
attractive properties of the tar sand reservoirs
should make California an important center
for tar sand development.
The tar sand resource in Texas is estimated
at 4.S billion barrels due to the recognition
and improved definition of three large
deposits-the San Miguel D, the Anacacho
and the Hensel formations.
The Kentucky tar sand resource in-place
isestirmated at 1.T billion barrels measured,
plus an additional 1.7 billion barrels spe-
culative, up from the previous estimate of
less than 50 million barrels.
Alabama is estimated to have 6.5 billion
barrels of tar sand in-place, mainly in one
large deposit, the Hartselle sandstone of
northern Alabama.
A major new tar sand/heavy oil area,con-
tainingabout 10 billion barrels of speculative
resource in-place, has been identified on
the North Slope of Alaska, overlying the
Kuparuk River oil field.
Ouer 1,100 Heavy Oil Deposits Have
Been Identified and Tabulated; They Constitute
an Important, Only Partly Developed National
Resource. Reservoir properties and production
histories were identified (from publicly available
data)for 1,10O heavy oil fields and reservoirs in
the U.S. (Heavy oil fields are defined as deposits
havingan oil gravitybetween 10'APIannd 20'API).
The majority of the heavy oil reservoirs and
fields are in California, with 356deposuts, fexas,
with 350 deposits, and Arkansas, with 120
deposits.
Heavy oil deposits constiture ar important
and challenging UU.S. resource target that require

per year, and evaporation from the reservoir is
estimated at 70 in. (1,780 mm) per year (F. P. Kipple,
written commun., 1975).
When the study began (October 1962) nearly 70
percent of the vegetation on the flood plain was
saltcedar (Tamarix: chinensis)1, with the remaining
vegetation consisting of mesquite (Prosopis), willow
GSalix), cottonwood (Populus), seepwillow (Baccharis),
and seepweed (Suaeda). Vegetation was removed from
the flood plain in segments of several acres at different
periods during 1967-71. Virtually all the study area
was cleared of vegetation by March 1971.

In most places the gypsum in the nodules is massive
and earthy, but locally they consist of sggregates of
diamond-shaped crystals or fibers (fig. 22). At any
given locality the crystal form of the gypsum sppears
to be uniform, but the forms differ from one locality to
another. These crystal forms may be an epbemeral
feature subject to seasonal change and may reflect the
presence of impurities or seasonal differences in pbysical
environment, such as degree and rate of recent wetting
or drying. The hemibydrate, bassanite although com-
mon in the chloride layer at the surface, was not
observed in this buried layer of nodules where there is
little sodium chloride.
The nodules contain traces of borates and nitrates;
no nitrates were detected in the salt crust.
Below the sulfate layer is the carbonate layer of silty
sand, containing tiny delicate crystals of acutely ter-
minated calcite as illustrated on figure 23. This
calcite is abundant, but comprises only a fraction of a
percent of the deposit. The high proportion of calcium
and carbonate in the deposit (see for example, S136a,
table 31) is due chiefly to the clastic limestone and
dolomite. The acutely terminated calcite is the cbar-
acteristic mineral of the carbonate zone, but by no
mesns is it the dominant one. It is in fact a minor one.
Its deposition possibly is facilitated by the organic

source of petroleum hydrocarbons, a possibility
that has been demonstrated by laboratory experi-
ments. As slow as the process of conversion of
organic material to hydrocarbons is, '%C studies in-
dicate that the process can occur in less than 10,000
years.
The higher forms of life that grow and live on the
land are unimportant, but the lower planktonic or-
ganisms, such as diatoms and algae, that thrive
abundantly near the surface of the sea, are now
considered the most probable and important source
materials. Some geologists think that the differ-
ences in oils may be due to differences in source
material, but this seems quite unimportant, since
the complicated processes that follow could yield
vastly greater differences.
The organic remains accumulate in the bottom
muds of lagoons or in depressions on the floor of
shallow seas and there become incorporated in ac-
cumulating sediments. Trask has tested thousands
of bottom mud samples and has found the organic
content to be fairly constant for about 160 kilome-
ters offshore and to range from 0.3 percent in deep
sea oozes to 7 percent off the coast of California.

named, and formally accepted stratigraphic
units that might have an economic potential in
this industry. Lithologically, these break down
into quartz-mica schists, quartzites, sandstones
(variable in degree of consolidation ), quartz
conglomerates. quartz gravels, and several
widely separated tripoli districts. Also included
were many geologically undesignated dune sand
occurrences, terrace sands and gravels, com-
mercial chert deposits, massive quartz pegma-
tites, hydrothermal replacement bodies and
silicified zones, some of which have been and
probably are viable from an economic point
of view.
In this connection there are many scattered,
very pure, silica sand deposits of Holocene age
along the coastal plains of South Carolina.
Georgia, and Florida, some of which have been
and are being reworked by wind and the present
rtver systems. Another interesting and valuable
source type may be referred to as the St.
Lucte soil zone which is well-developed along
a stretch of east Florida coast particularly
un St, Luce county (Hudson, 1946), the type
locality, as well as inland in this state and in
south Georgia (Teas, 1921). The key to the
purity of these deposits relates to a fluctuating
ground water table and an excess of azohumic
and other organic acids resulting from decaying
swamp vegetation which leaches the iron nor-
mally present in the surficial sand. This organic
chemistry develops the so-called Van Dyke or
sap-brown ore at the base of the leached zone
which was much sought after as an organic dye
for paint, wood stains, and inks before the ad-
vent of aniline dyes. Most of these types of
deposits are from 4 to possibly 12 ft thick on
flat terrain with consequent disappointingly low
tonnages. However, they are commercially
viable at a few points in each of the states men-
tioned and can supply local flint glass sand
markets for indeterminant periods of time if
extensive enough, which several have proved to
be. The inevitable silica sand rings which par-
tially surround the puzzling ''Carolina Bays,''
are believed to be a manifestation of this leach-
ng and in one instance were commercially ex-
ploited for several years in Williamsburg
County, South Carolina (Buie, 1958).
Two formational units for high grade ceramic
products exposed in the eastern and a few
middle western states warrant detailed citation
as the most successfully exploited silica raw
material sources on the basis of tonnage and
profit in this country. They are the St. Peter
sandstone together with its stratigraphic equivr
lents of Lower Ordovician age, and the Orl
kany sandstone or orthoquartzite of Lower
Devonian age. The St. Peter is exposed and
exploited principally in northern Illinois.and,
to a lesser degree, in southern Wisconsin and
Missouri. Sandstones of the same time equiva-
lency also are exploited in Arkansas and Okla-
homa (Lamar, 1927; Ham, 1945). These for-
rmations are relatively flat-lying and massively
bedded materials of weak to moderate consoli-
dation that lend themselves equally well to
open pit or underground mining recovery, both
methods being currently employed. Physical
recovery is high and a minimum of plant
preparation is necessary because of its extreme
natural purity. Reserves are large and nearly

ship will soon be, if it has not already been,
completely zoned out of the market by urbani-
2ation pressures.
The Oriskany quartzite, more precisely the
Ridgeley sandstone (Harris, 1972), is a ridge
maker, to a large degree, because of its greater
induration and consequent structural attitudes.
For the most part it is found in strongly
dipping beds ranging from 45' to the vertical
and even overturned. In a few areas it is as
flat-bedded as the St. Peter, whereas, locally, it
may be preserved intact in homoclinal, anti-
clinal, and synclinal postures (Bates, 1960).
Being an integral part of the Appalachian High-
lands, its economic occurrences are pretty well
limited to the tri-state area of Virginia, West
Virginia, and Pennsylvania. The texture, purity.
and degree of induration are all subject to es-
treme variability which is much less seldom
encountered with the St, Peter. However, by
and large, it shares the same perfection of grain
that the St. Peter enjoys and most of the defects
are secondarily induced and can be mitigated
and often nearly eliminated by suitable plant
beneficiation. Here again, all known reserves
in the technical sense and much that could be
classed as potential resource acreage is believed
to be owned by, or under long-term lease t4

tion of what is already controlled will doubtke4
never be completely exploited because of th
ever-increasing zonal restrictions due to urbant-
2zation.

R0P-70% E., transverse to the altered zone. Fluorite is erratically dis.
ttpihuted in the veins, and the content ranges from a trace to as much as

sUGGESTIONS FOR EXPLORATION OF FLUORITE DEPOSITS
The best commereial fluorite deposits are more likely to oceur in a lime-
stone host than in a voleanie one.
The deposits in altered voleanie rocks probably are too low in grade
to support large-scale mining under 1969 priees, and veins rich enough
to warrant selective mining are small. However, richer replacement
bodies in Paleozoic limestone may have formed beneath the voleanie
eover approximately coineident with the extensive altered zones of areas
5 through 8 and along the northwest alinement of the zones. This depth
may approximate 1,000 feet in areas 5 and 6.
Deposits in limestone contain the best grade ore, locally 90 pereent
CaF, hy weight. In some of the deposits, fluorite completely replaees
limestone. but it rarely if ever rcplaces silicifled fragments of limestone,
quartzite, or rhyolite, Hence the grade of ore in tho silicifiel breeeias
will never be as good as that possihle in the limestone ; also, a penalty is
ineurred for silica in fluorspar ore. Howevcr, because most of the fiaorite
in the brecciated jasperized limestone coats and cements breceia frag-
Yments, the bulk of the fluorite can be recovered by crushing to halfineh
grain size and screening out the undersize, whieh contains the fluorith.
Standard flotation methods can be used to separate fluorite and silies
to produce acid-grade (97 percent CaF,) fluorspar, and since metsk
lurgieal grade spar need only have an effeetive CaF content of 60 per-
cent, the deposits in silieified breceias should not be negleeted. To
separate caleite from fluorite by flotation requires expensive heatingo

The possible importance of the deposits in limestone is supporteßh
the striking resemblance of the Hi-Grade and Mammoth deposits to ro7

in ways that numerical meth-ds cannot yet accom-
plish.
Lacking direct information from drilling, favorable
ground is defined largely by comparing available geo-
logic, geochemical, and geophysical data with those
from known and developed ore deposits. The primary
objective is to identify geologic environments favor-
qable for the occurrence of mineral resources in the
are. being assessed. Ore deposit models, especially
tho--: including interpretation of the ore-forming pro-
cesses, embodying these favorable geologic environ-
ments can be powerful tools in evaluating the resource
potential of an area. Do the observed characteristics
of the area being evaluated match the descriptive
model of an ore deposit type? Did the right sequence
of processes take place that could form ore depositsf
Genetic models are needed to flesh out incomplete
descriptive frameworks; moreover, consideration of
processes that form ore is inherent in those circum-
stances where prediction of resource potential is re-
quired. If the basic conditions of an ore deposit model
are met, other factors such as composition of host rock
or availability of structure can be used to determine
degr :s of potential more closely and to focus atten-
tion a specific areas. In any area a large number of
ore deposit models must be considered, some to be
examined closely if geologic factors are favorable,
some to be rejected if they are unfavorable.
Definitions
A high mineral resource potential is deemed to exist
where geologic, geochemical, and geophysical char-
acteristics favorable for resource accumulation are
known to be present, or where enough of these char-
acteristics are present to give strong support to genetic
models favorable for resource accumulation and
where evidence shows that mineral concentration-
mineralization in the broad sense-has taken place.
This category includes not only known mining dis-
tricts i-ut also other areas where data are adequate
to demonstrate or indicate an excellent possibility that
mineralized rock exists. Where available, data on the
4e, grade, and location of individual deposits are
Wmportant in making this assessment, but the avail-
ability of these data is not a primary requisite. Areas
ith high mineral resource potential are more closely
hdged with respect to current economic conditions
than those with lesser resource potential.
Moderate mineral resource potential exists where
@ologic, geochemical, and geophysical characteris-
tics favorable for resource accumulation are known
can reasonably be interpreted to be present but
here evidence for mineralization is less clear cut or
Mas not yet been found. A reasonable possibility for
thediseovery of valuable mineral deposits should exist
all areas rated as having moderate mineral resource
potential. Genetic models are especially valuable in
those areas with moderate potential where extrapo-
lation of subtle data may be required. Those areas
classified as having moderate potential on the basis
of sparse information could have this rating changed
to high by new and favorable information or by
changes in demand for a commodity or in economic
conditions.
Low mineral resource potential is assigned to areas
where geologic, geochemical, and geophysical char-
acteristics are unfavorable, where evidence indicates
that mineral concentrations are unlikely, or where
requirements of genetic models cannot be supported,
such as a lack of source or mechanism of accumu-
lation. This broad category embraces areas with ob-
vious but dispersed and apparently uneconomical
mineral occurrences, as well as areas with few indi-
cations of mineralization. Use of the low potential
category requires an element of positive knowledge;
it should not be a catchall for areas lacking adequate
data.
A category of unknown mineral resource potential
is necessary where the level of knowledge, at the ap-
propriate scale, is so inadequate that to classify a unit
area as high, moderate, or low in mineral resource
potential would be misleading. The size of the unit
area under consideration and the detail of informa-
tion available are key elements in deciding where this
category is best applied. Preliminary assessments of
areas requiring further study would particularly ben-
efit from such a category.
Almost all areas of the earth's crust contain mineral
commodities of at least some possible economic value
were they adequately explored and should a market
develop. It is thus deemed inadvisable to class any
area as having no mineral resource potential, although
some areas may be classed as having no potential for
a particular mineral commodity.
1Discussion
Mineral resources form in all types of geologic en-
vironments, and occurrences vary widely even within
a single general type of deposit. For completeness,
statements describing high or moderate resource po-
tential should specify commodity and mode of oc-
currence; data and logic used to reach the conclusion
should be made clear in supporting documentation.
The magnitude (tonnage, grade, value) of possible
mineral occurrences must be considered in assigning
areas to high, moderate, and low resource potential
categories; an important distinction exists between
possible large or clustered deposits, as compared with
small and isolated deposits. For example, hydrother-
mal metal concentrations range from small isolated
deposits, to clusters of small deposits, to large deposits
surrounded by halos of smaller deposits, to isolated

significant amounts of uranium. The Cottonwood zone is
associated with a uranium deposit reported to contain 13
million tons of 0.5 to 0.6 percent uranium.
Alteration minerals characterizing the sedimentary
section exposed along Cottonwood Creek, at the extreme
west end of the uranium ore deposit, are shown in Figure
13. Clinoptilolite and erionite occur sporadically through
the stratigraphic section and are more abundant in beds
of tuffaceous sandstones. Feldspar occurs throughout the
section.
Uranium occurs at several stratigraphic intervals in
the Cottonwood section. Uranium in the basal 66 ft (20 m)
of section occurs in the opaline silica-rich, thinly-laminated,
ferric hydroxide stained layers.-The uranium is closely
associated with mercury, lithium, arsenic and antimony,
strongly reflecting a common presence in the altering
hydrothermal solutions. This is strikingly shown by the
uranium and arsenic-rich calcite layer at approximately
150 ft (46 m). The variability of the elemental contents
in the lower 66 ft (20 m) is obscured by a composite
sampling in the 13 to 46 ft (4 to 14 m), ie, individual
layers and beds were sampled only in the lower and upper
parts of the interval. Above 66 ft (20 m) the elements
begin to separate. Lithium is less than 50 ppm in the
calcite layer at 150 ft (46 m) and it is inversely related to
the uranium, arsenic, and mercury content. Carbonaceous
debris is plentiful in the 92 to 121 ft (28 to 37 m) interval.
Both lithium but particularly uranium are enriched in the
121 to 138 ft (37 to 42 m) interval of organic-rich (ostracods
and carbonaceous debris) lacustrine mudstones that alter-
nate with black opaline-silica layers. A very coarse-textured
tuff grades upward into a finer air-fall tuff. The tuff is little
altered, contains the highest thorium content in the se-
quence, and is low in uranium, lithium, arsenic, and
mercury. The lacustrine sequence resumes at about 154 ft
(47 m) with an enrichment in lithium, uranium. and arsenic
in an organic-rich claystone. This sequence is interrupted
at about 150 ft (50 m) by a gray air-fall tuff indicated in
the sequence by the thin bed enriched in thorium. Above
this bed, lacustrine claystones are enriched in lithium.
arsenic, and mercury. This is the thickest interval of lithium
enrichment in the section. Above the claystones, at about
200 ft (61 m), the section becomes a very coarse textured
tuffaceous sandstone partially covered by slumping-

Whien c falls betwecn 1 and 2, the point of inflection actually occurs at a
negative value of P, and so no longer corresponds to a point on the expcri-
mental isotherm : the isotherm is then no longer of 'Type ll but has become a
clear Type lll. lf c lies between 0 and 1, the value of P at the point of
inflection is imaginary; again, the isotherm is of Type lll.
2.4 A9lication of the BET Equstion te Type li lsotherms
The form of the BET equation most often applied to experimental data is
that given in (2.37), viz.
A few representative BET plots of Type ll isotherms are given in Higs.
2.6-2.9. Those in Fig. 2.6 for nitrogen adsorption at - 193'C on various
catalysts, taken from the original paper of Brunauer, Emmett and Teller''',
are linear betwcen relative pressures of about 0-05 and 0-35. On extra-
polation they pass close to the origin (a feature which is typical of nitro-
gen adsorption on oxides and hydrated oxides) and this indicates a
srelatively large value of c, which is associated with the presence of a distinct
knee in the adsorption isotherm (p. 57). 'The isotherms and BET plots in
Fig. 2.7, obtained by Davis, DDeWitt and Emrmett''''; illustrate a c>e
where c is small (e.g. for n-C,Hl,g, c = 54 at 0' and c = I16 at -78'C)
The isotherm is much more rounded at the low pressurc end and corre-
spondingly the intercept on the p[x(pg -p)-axis is further away from the
origin; the range of linearity is roughly the same as before, however.
Contrary to what had at one time been supposed, the range of validity ol
the BET equation docs not always extend to relative pressures as high a>
0-30 or 0-35. In Fig. 2.8 and 2.9 there are examples of BET plots wluch
begin to depart from linearity when the rclative pressure excecds 01. The
plots of Fig. 2.8 are taken from the recent work of lsirikyan and K iselev''''
on graphitized carbon black. The range of relative pressures over

1he 8D of fluid inclusions of late Plio-
cene age (laminae 10B-5 through 10B-7
and 10A-5 through 10A-8) average about
-60 per mil, or about 40 per mil heavicr
than that of modern recharge (-99 per
mil) and late (7) Wisconsin age (5)
ground water (--102 per mil) discharging
today from the major artesian springs in
the region (Fig. 2). More significantly,
the &D values, in general, become pro-
gressively lighter with decreasing age
over the last 1 to 2 million years. Do
these values represent deuterium of Plio-
cene and Pleistocene ground water
trapped in the veins during the calcite
precipitation, or are they artifacts of (i)
water-mineral exchange, (ii) rcmobiliza-
tion of fluid inclusions during calcite
recrystallization, or (iii) selective diffu-
sion of 'H4O from the fluid inclusions?
We cannot attrihute the changes in deu-
terium to water-mineral exchange be-
cauuse the water-bearing frhctures in thc
regional carbonate aquifer, feeding the
modern (and fosil flow system, are
typically coated with calcite or dolomite
(8). This coating precludes the echange
of hydrogen between water and clay
minerals during flow from recharge to
discharge areas, In fet, the difference in
therefore, air tends to occupy the larger pores. The two fluids---water and
air--coexist in the soil by occupying different portions of the pore spaw
having different geometric configurations. For this reason, the soil exhiht-
toward the two fluids different conductivity or permeability functions, a-
these relate to the different effective diameters and tortuosities of the pore
sets occupied by each fluid. Only when the soil is completely permeated by
one or the other, be it water or air, should either flowing fluid encounter the
same transmission coefficient of the medium. (See the discussion of intrms.
permeability in Chapter 8.)
Notwithstanding the differences between water flow and air flow, n i-
possible to formulate the convective flow of air in the soil as an equation
analogous to Darcy's law for water flow, as follows:
where (?; and ?, are the amounts of exchange at time t and equilibrium
() respectively; ,, * concentration of tracer ion initially present, and
S, Y, and r represent the surface area, volume, and radius of the exchang-
er particles. The biggest practical problem in determining the diffusion
coefficient is the measurement of the surface area. One method involv-
ing gas adsorption and another involving a projection method have been
used to determine S (60). A better method would be one which is in-
dependent of the surface area. The effective or apparent diffusion co-
efficient, D', is related to interdiffusion of the two exchanging cations,
or interchange of cation A and B with the same valence, D, D] =DI
and is independent of the composition. The apparent diffusion coeffi-
cient varies with temperature according to the Arrhenius equation. For
zeolites, D' varies from 1 x I0'' to 1 g 10' cm' sec''. Detailed studies
of ion exchange kinetics and diffusion have been made on chabazite
(60, 61) and mordenite (62, 63) using radiochemical methods to follow
the ion exchange process. In chabazite, the narrowest apertures, about
3.9 A in diameter (Chap. 2), are large enough to permit diffusion of
most ions without squeezing. It is probable that replacement of some
of the ions found within the hexagonal prism would involve cation dif-
fusion through the 6-rings. The self-diffusion coefficients of certain ions
in chabazite follow the Arrhenius equation (see Table 7. 16). The energy
barriers associated with the self-diffusion process vary from about 7
kcal for the univalent ions to about double that value for calcium and
strontium ions. However, the energy barrier was 8.7 kcal for barium
ion, the largest of the divalent ions.
The Arrhenius equation is used to determine the activation energy, E:

believes that there are also important
advantages in providing for individual
protection in ways compatible with the
containment and assurance
requirements. In discussing this issue,
the SAB Subcommitiee stated that: ''We
support the use of a population risk
criteria. We believe it is impractical to
provide absolute protection to every
individual for all postulated events or
for very long periods. On the other hand,
in our view it is important that, for the
first several hundred years, residents of
the region immediately outside the
accessible environment have very great
assurance that they will suffer no, or
negligible. ill effects from the
repository.''
The individual protection
requirements in the final rule limit the
annual exposure from tUhe disposal
system to a member of the public in the
accessible environment, for the first
1,D00 years afler disposal, to no more
than 25 millirems to the whole body or
75 millirems to any organs. These
limitations apply to the predicted
behavior of the disposal system,
including consideration of the
uncertainties in predicted behavior,
assuming that the disposal system is not
disrupted by human intrusion or the
occurrence of unlikely natural events.
The Agency chose the limits of 25
millirem/year to the whole body and 75
milliremfyear to any organ because it
believes that they represent a
sufficiently stringent kevel of protection
for situations where no more lhan a few
individuals are likely to receive this
exposure. If such sn individual were
exposed to this level over s lifetime
(which seems particularly unlikely given
the localized pathways through which
waste might escape from a geologic
repository]. the Agency estimates his
would cause a 5x 107'chance of
incurring a premature fatal cancer.
In choosing a time period for these
requirements to protect individuals
nearby disposal sysiems, the Agency
took into account concerns such as
those expressed by the SAB by
examining the effects of choosing
different time frames, As 10I00 years
was chosen for the containment
requirements because it is long enough
to encourage use of disposal sites with
natural characteristics that enhance
long-term isolation, 1,D00 years was
chosen for the individual protection
provisions because the Agency's
assessments indicate it ie long enough to
insure that particularly good engineered
barriers would need to be used at
potential sites where some ground water
would be expected to flow through a
rmined geologic repository. Use of a time
much shorter than 1,00 years would not
call for substantial engineered barriers
even at disposal sites with a lot of
ground water flow.
On the other hand, demonstrating
compliance with individual exposure
limits for times much longer than 1,000
years appears to be quite difficult
because of the analytical uncertainties
involved. It would require predicting
radonuclide concentrations-even from
releases of tiny portions of the waste-
in all the possible ground water
pathways flowing in all directions from
the disposal system, at all depths down
to 2,500 feet, as a Junction of time over
many thousands of years. At some of the
sites being considered (and possibly all
of them, depending upon what is
discovered during site characterization)
the only certain way to comply with
such requirements for periods on the
order of 10.D000 years appears to be to
use very expensive engineered barriers
that would rule out any potential
releases over most of this period. While
such barriers could provide longer-term
protection for individuals, they would
not provide substantial benefits to
populations because the containment
and assurance requirements already
reduce population risks to very small
levels.
Based on all of these considerations,
the Agency has decided that s 1000-
year duration is adequate for
quantitative limits on individual
exposures after disposal. For longer time
periods, several of the qualitative
asSurance requirements should help to
reduce the chances that individuals will
receive serious radiation exposures. In
addition. 40 CFR Part 19t in no way
limits the future applicability of the
Agency's drinking water standards [40
CFR Part 141}-which protect
community water supply systems
through institutional controls-or of
similar standards that future generations-
may choose to adopt.
ln assessing the performance of a
disposal system with regard to
individual exposures, all pathways of
radioactive material or radiation rom
the disposal system to people shall be
considered. In particular, the
assessments must assume that
individuals consume all of their drinking
water [2 liters per day) from any portion
of a ''significant source of ground water''
anywhere outside of the ''controlled
area'' surrounding the disposal system.
Significant sources of ground water are
defined to include underground
formations that are likely to be able to
provide enough water for a community
water system as defined in 40 CFR Part
141. (More information regarding this
wastes are generated and when the
projected health effects manifest
themselves made it difficult to
determine what level of residual risk
should be allowed by these disposal
standards, The difficulty arose because
most of the benefits derived in the
process of waste production fall upon
the current generation, while most of the
risks fall upon future generations. Thus,
a potential problem of intergenerational
equity with respect to the distribution of
risks and benefits became apparent.
This problem is sometimes referred to as
the intergenerational risk issue, and it is
not unique to the disposal of high-level
radioactive wastes. If the Agency tried
to insure that these standards fully
satisfied a criterion of intergenerational
equity with respect to the distribution of
risks and benefits, it might appear that
no risk should be passed on to :ture
generations. This is a condition which
the Agency believes cannot be met by
disposal technologies foreseeable within
this century. However, there is one
particular factor which has reinforced
EPA's decision about the
reasonableness of the risks permitted
under the disposal standards. This is the
following evaluation of the risks
associated with undisturbed uranium
ore bodies. Additionally, for the purpose
of comparing the risks permitted under
the standards to other radiation risks
which people are currently exposed to, a
brief discussion of the risks from other
natural sources of radiation is also
included.
Uronium Ore: Most uranium ore in the
United States occurs in permeable
geologic strata containing flowing
ground water. Radionuclides in the ore,
particularly uranium and radium.
continuously enter this ground water.
EPA estimated the potential risks from
these undisturbed ore bodies using the
same generalized environmental models
that were used for releases from a waste
repository. The effects associated with
the amount of ore needed to produce the
high-level wastes that would fill the
model geologic repository can vary
considerably. Part of this variation
corresponds to actual differences from
one ore body to another; part can be
attributed to uncertainties in the
assessment. After revising the
population risk models in accordance
with the recommendations of the SAB
Subcommittee, these estimates of the
risks from unmined ore bodies ranged
from about 10 to more than 100.000
excess cancer deaths over 10.000 years,
Thus, leaving the ore unmined appears
to present a risk to future generations
comparable to the risks from disposal of
wastes covered by these standards.
Variations in Natural Background:
Radionuclides occur naturally in the
earth in very large amounts, and are
produced in the atmosphere by cosmic
radiation. Everyone is exposed to
natural background radiation from these
natural radionuclides and from direct
exposure to cosmic radiation. Individual
exposures average about 100 millirems
per year, with a range of about 60 to 200
milliremfyear. These natural
background radiation levels have
remained relatively constant for a very
long time. According to the same linear.
nonthreshold dose effect relationship
used in EPA's other analyses, an
increase of one millirem per year [about
one percent) in natural background in
the United States would result in about
60 additional deaths per year, or 800.000
over a 10.D00-year period.
Natural Radionuclide Concentrations
in Ground Water: One source of this
exposure to natural background
radiation comes from naturally
occurring radionuclides found in ground
water. Radium is the most important of
the naturally occurring radioactive
materials likely to occur in public water
supply systems, but uranium is also
found in ground waters due to its
natural occurrence. Surveys of
radionuclides in ground water systems
indicate: a United States range of 0.1 to
50 picocuries [pCi] per liter for radium-
226 [with isolated sources exceeding 100
pCifliter). up to 74 pCi/liter for all
alpha-emitting radionuclides other than
uranium [although most of the alpha-
emitting concentrations are below 3
pCi/liter) and up to 650 pCi/liter for
total uranium concentrations. Elevated
radium-226 concentrations are found
along the Atlantic coastal region and the
Midwest; low levels are usually found in
the treated water supplies in the
western States. Elevated uranium and
alpha-emitting radionuclide
concentrations are generally limited to
the Rocky Mountain region and Maine
and Pennsylvania in the east.
The Agency's primary drinking water
regulations (4O CFR Part 141] limit the
contamination levels for radium-226 and
radium-228 to 5 pCifliter and the levels
for total alpha-emitting contamination
fexcluding radon and uranium) to 15
pCilliter. Elevated concentrations of
radium in drinking water are generally a
problem associated with smaller
community water systems, with an
estimated 500 systems exceeding 5 pCif
liter, The Agency's risk assessments
indicate that continuous consumption of
water containing the maximum amount
of radium allowed may cause between
D.7 and 3 cancers per year per million
exposed persons.
Environmental Impacts
A Draft Environmental Impact
Stutement [EIS] was prepared for the
proposed rule, in accordance with tho
Agency's procedures for the voluntary
preparation of ElS's [3o FR 37419).
However, section 121(c) of the NWPA
subsequently exempted this action from
preparation of an EIS under section
102[2](C) of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and from any
environmental review under
subparagraph [E) or (F) of section 1022)
of the NEPA. Accordingly, s Final EIS
has not been prepared for promulgation
of this rule. The potential health impacts
of this action are summarized above,
and much of the information that would
have been contained in a Final EIS is
documented in the Background
Information Document that accompanics
this final version of 4O CFR Part 191.
Regulatory Impacts
This rule was submitted to the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) for
review as required by Executive Order
12291. The final rule has not been
classified as a ''major rule'' in'
accordance with the guidelines provided
by the Executive Order. Any comments
received from OMB and EPA's
responses to those comments are
available for public inspection in the
docket cited above under the heading
''aDDRESSEs.''
The Agency has had to take an
unusual approach in considering the
regulatory impacts of this proposed
action-as required by Executive Order
12291. In most cases, a regulation
concerns an ongoing activity and may
be considered a burden whose costs
should be judged against the regulatory
benefits, Here, it was not possible to
quantify the costs and benefits of this
actiorcompared to the consequences of
no regulation because there is no
specific ''baseline'' program to consider.
The appropriate regulations must be
established before the regulated activity
can even begin. Thus, the typical
perspectives on costs and benefits are
altered. Instead, the Agency evaluated
how the costs of commercial waste
management and disposal might change
in response to different levels of
protection from the containment
requirements, Similar evaluations were
not performed for the wastes from
atomic energy defense activities
because sufficient information was not
available.
To evaluate the effects of diflerent
levels of protection. EPA considered the
performance of different repository
designs in several diferent geologic
