rine limit (Fig. 2-2) show a distinct pattern of 
calving-bay propagation into northern Lauren-
tide ice.  This pattern in itself is a strong indicator 
that the maximum reconstruction in Figure 2-2 
is more nearly correct than the minimum.  The 
sea penetrated northwestern ice-stream channels 
in M'Clure Strait and Amundsen Gulf by 12,600 
BP, at least 3000 yr prior to penetration of the 
eastern ice-stream channel in Lancaster Sound.  
In fact, the Amundsen Gulf ice stream had re-
ceded by 10,215 BP to Coronation Gulf, where
a bottleneck checked calving-bay propagation; 
also, the M'Clure Strait ice stream lay against the
Winter Harbor moraine between about 11,000 
and 10,000 BP, without concurrent recession of 
the Lancaster Sound ice stream in the east.  Rapid 
breakup of northern Laurentide ice commenced 
after 10,000 BP with the withdrawal of ice from 
the Winter Harbor moraine. A calving bay had 
propagated eastward into Viscount Melville 
Sound by 9800 BP and into Barrow Strait north 
of Prince of Wales and Somerset Islands by 9380 
BP.  Westward propagation of a calving bay into 
Lancaster Sound was underway by 9280 BP.  Sub-
sequently, coastal Somerset and Prince of Wales 
Islands, as well as northern Boothia Peninsula, 
were largely cleared of ice by 9200 BP, and the 
southern Gulf of Boothia was cleared by 8870 
BP.  Thus, the northern sector of the Laurentide 
Ice Sheet was dissected by calving bays that 
propagated inland to the upper marine limit.  By 
8160 BP, the northern ice-sheet margin, no 
longer being dissected by calving bays, lay 
against the MacAlpine moraine system (Blake, 
1966), which partly outlines the residual Kee-
watin dome, and against moraines on Melville 
Peninsula (Craig, 1965a), which may possibly 
mark the western margin of a residual dome in 
Foxe Basin.  Recession from these moraine sys-
tems and final ice-sheet disintegration are dis-
cussed with the history of the interior of the Lau-
rentide Ice Sheet.

Northeastern Sector

Late Wisconsin Maximum.  The northeastern 
margin of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, particularly 
in Labrador and Baffin Island, is discussed in 
detail here, because the concepts derived from 
studies of this margin have greatly influenced 
development of the model of a restricted Arctic 
ice cover during the late Wisconsin glaciation.  At 
its maximum, the northeastern margin of the Lau-
rentide Ice Sheet extended from the Maritime 
Provinces to northern Baffin Island.  Along this
margin, the coastal mountains of Labrador-Un-
gava and Baffin Island are the dissected edges of 
plateau blocks that have been uplifted and tilted.  
Of two early views of Wisconsin ice extent, the 
first proposed limited Wisconsin ice extent.  Fol-
lowing the work by Lieber (1861), Daly (1902) 
suggested that the Torngat Mountains in Labra-
dor were not overtopped by Labradorean (Lau-
rentide) ice that streamed through deep troughs 
toward the Atlantic.  This conclusion was based 
largely on the observed upper limit of glacier 
deposits, as well as on the presence of wide-
spread felsenmeer at high levels.  Coleman (1920, 
1921) later agreed with these conclusions and 
even argued that Laurentide ice did not reach 
the Atlantic.  Coleman (1921, 1926) further pos-
tulated that Wisconsin Laurentide ice did not 
overrun the southeast coast of Labrador and that 
the widespread presence of high-lying felsen-
meer suggests that much of Newfoundland re-
mained free of ice throughout Wisconsin time.  
The second early theory, which supported more-
extensive Wisconsin ice, was put forward by 
Odell (1933) and accepted by Tanner (1944).  The 
main evidence cited for this viewpoint was the 
presence of high-level erratics and poorly pre-
served striations; the felsenmeer was assigned a 
postglacial age.  Flint and others (1942) postu-
lated, on the basis of high erratics and striated 
surfaces, that the Shickshock Mountains in the 
Gasp~~ Peninsula were overrun by Wisconsin ice; 
felsenmeer on the summits was again thought to 
have originated in postglacial time.  Subse-
quently, Flint (1971, p. 484-485) inferred that the 
Laurentide Ice Sheet overran all coastal high-
lands between New York and Labrador at some 
time during the Wisconsin glaciation.   
  The modern view of Wisconsin ice extent has 
its roots in field work carried out in the past two 
decades (reviewed by Ives, 1978).  The major re-
sult has been the development of the weathering 
zone concept.  The weathering zones envisioned 
are not to be confused with the geologic terms 
"weathering zone" or "zone of weathering," 
which refer to a weathered zone in bedrock or 
regolith that is nearly parallel with the surface 
(Flint, 1971, p. 287).  Rather, it refers to "units of 
the land surface which are distinguishable from 
each other on the basis of the distinct weathering 
features that record different lengths of time 
through which they have formed" (Dyke, 1977, 
p. 40).  Three broad weathering zones, as well as 
possible subdivisions, have been recognized 
along the entire northeastern margin of the Lau-
have played an important role in recession of 
southern and western Laurentide terrestrial mar-
gins, because the deeper lakes may temporarily 
have given these margins a marine character.  If 
ice streams entering the proglacial lakes became 
afloat, they would have acquired the same ability 
to pull ice out of the ice sheet, as did floating 
ice-stream tongues along Laurentide marine mar-
gins.  This suggests that calving bays in the 
deeper proglacial lakes could have migrated up 
the ice-stream channels and have cleared ice 
from these lake basins.   
  Downdraw of the northwestern sector of the 
Laurentide Ice Sheet, and perhaps of the western 
margin of the Innuitian Ice Sheet, through ma-
rine ice streams was probably underway by 14,-
000 BP, because calving bays had propagated 
into M'Clure Strait and probably into Amundsen 
Gulf by 12,600 BP and because Prince Patrick 
Island was at least partially free of ice by 11,660 
BP.  It is rather striking that deglaciation of coasts 
or inter-island channels elsewhere in the Queen 
Elizabeth Islands or along the northern Lauren-
tide margin apparently had not occurred by this 
time.   
  Disintegration of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet 
after 14,000 BP may have been rapid along its 
eastern and western margins for several reasons.  
Dissipation of the Laurentide ice fan on the 
plains of western Canada may have created an 
ice-free corridor in northeastern British Colum-
bia, where merger of the Laurentide and Cordil-
leran Ice Sheets may have previously created an 
ice saddle.  Ice saddles typically are high enough 
to lie above the equilibrium line, so the eastern 
Cordilleran margin in northwestern Alberta and 
northeastern British Columbia was probably in 
an accumulation zone when the saddle existed, 
but was suddenly thrown into an ice-ablation 
zone after the corridor formed.  This might have 
thrown this portion of the eastern margin of the 
Cordilleran Ice Sheet into a negative mass bal-
ance regime, causing rapid retreat.  The western 
margin retreated when calving bays carved away 
any ice-shelf fringe confined in the straits and 
sounds or pinned by the island archipelago along 
the Pacific coast.  Removal of any ice-shelf fringe, 
as well as sea-level rise and climatic warming, 
would have allowed ice streams occupying fiords 
in the Coast Mountains to surge.  Such surges 
could downdraw the western fringe of the Cor-
dilleran Ice Sheet, allowing calving bays to mi-
grate into the coastal fiords.  The southern margin 
receded by marginal recession and downwasting.
General recession after 14,000 BP, which appar-
ently was interrupted only by the Sumas read-
vance, left only mountain-glacier complexes and
possibly residual ice caps by 9000 BP.   
  Figure 2-6 shows our reconstruction of glaciol-
ogical conditions at 10,000 BP, after ice fans 
along the southern and western terrestrial mar-
gins of the Laurentide Ice Sheet had been re-
placed by proglacial lakes in the Great Lakes and 
the Great Plains and after possible ice shelves 
along the northern and northeastern Laurentide 
Ice Sheet marine margins had been replaced by 
open waters in the Arctic Ocean and Baffin Bay.  
A calving bay had migrated up the Amundsen 
Gulf ice stream as far as Queen Maud Gulf, but 
an ice stream still occupied much of M'Clure 
Strait.  Downdraw of Innuitian and northern Lau-
rentide ice was caused by surging ice streams 
passing through Lancaster Sound, through inter-
island channels leading outward from the central 
Norwegian Bay area of the Queen Elizabeth Is-
lands, and through channels between Ellesmere 
Island and Greenland.   
  The overall chronology of northern deglacia-
tion shows delayed ice recession with the first 
deglaciation in the west about 12,600 BP, fol-
lowed by progressively younger deglaciation in 
the east.  This northern marine deglaciation is 
thus distinctly different from southern terrestrial 
deglaciation in timing and pattern.  As indicated 
in Chapter 8, we think that the pattern and chro-
nology of northern deglaciation reflect recession 
of an ice shelf on the Arctic Ocean that, in turn, 
regulated downdraw through northern ice 
streams and subsequent inland propagation of 
calving bays.   

North American Ice Sheets: 10,000 BP to 6000 
BP.  The central event of this interval was the 
final collapse of the Innuitian and Laurentide 
Ice Sheets, caused largely by downdraw through 
surging marine ice streams followed by calving-
bay migration up ice-stream channels.  By this 
mechanism, the Parry Channel south of the 
Queen Elizabeth Islands opened between 9500 
and 9000 BP, the channel between Ellesmere 
Island and Greenland began to open by 9500 BP, 
and most interisland channels beneath the In-
nuitian Ice Sheet were carved out by about 9000 
BP.  Calving bays propagated deep into northern 
Laurentide ice between 9500 and 8800 BP.  
Meanwhile, continued downdraw through the 
surging Hudson Strait ice stream greatly deep-
ened the Hudson Bay ice saddle, leading to
not bordered by ice shelves and terrestrial mar-
gins bordered by deep proglacial lakes.   

Conclusions.  These glaciological speculations 
emphasize that marine ice-sheet dynamics dom-
inated late Wisconsin collapse of the eastern, 
northeastern, northern, and interior sectors of the 
Laurentide Ice Sheet, as well as all sectors of the 
Innuitian Ice Sheet; these dynamics are dis-
cussed in more detail in Chapters 7 and 8. Thus 
large quantities of atmospheric heat need not be 
invoked to melt these ice sheets, because surging 
ice streams on marine margins transported inter-
ior ice seaward, where it could melt.  Ice would 
therefore be transported to the heat source, 
rather than the reverse.  Also, the predominance 
of marine dynamics means that the climatic 
change necessary to induce overall late Wiscon-
sin deglaciation need not be extraordinarily 
large, for the ice sheet could partly self-destruct 
through the positive feedback mechanisms de-
scribed in Chapter 8. In short, climatic amelio-
ration could melt southern terrestrial ice-sheet 
sectors, leading to a sea-level rise that could in-
duce further collapse of marine margins because 
of their inherent instability.  For example, sea-
level rise caused by climatic warming during the 
Erie interstade could trigger increased down-
draw through the Laurentian and Hudson Strait 
ice streams, as well as recession of the marine 
West Antarctic Ice Sheet (Chapter 7) and marine 
sectors of other ice sheets.  The secondary sea-
level rise induced by downdraw could, in turn, 
trigger further marine recession.  The predomi-
nance of marine processes in the northern, north-
eastern, and interior sectors of the Laurentide 
Ice Sheet also explains the asymmetrical reces-
sion toward Baffin Island, whose high eastern 
rim would protect the northeastern flank of the 
ice sheet from marine inroads, delaying ice col-
lapse until calving bays eventually propagated 
into Foxe Basin.  These processes may not have 
been restricted solely to marine ice-sheet mar-
gins; they may also have operated where deep 
proglacial lakes abutted retreating terrestrial 
margins.   
  The glaciological speculations given in this 
section highlight the southern terrestrial margin 
of the Laurentide Ice Sheet as the most likely 
area for climatic reversals to cause readvances 
superimposed on overall late Wisconsin degla-
ciation.  This is because widespread late Wiscon-
sin stagnation may have characterized much of 
the western sector and because climatic reversals 
may not have affected ongoing downdraw and 
calving-bay migration in marine ice-sheet sec-
tors.  However, caution must be exercised in in-
terpreting widespread fluctuations of the south-
ern Laurentide margin in terms of climatic 
change, because downdraw through marine sec-
tors could have controlled the positions of inter-
ior domes and saddles, thereby influencing events 
on far-distant terrestrial margins.   
  One major component of the Antarctic Ice 
Sheet-~namely, ice shelves-~has been largely ig-
nored in this discussion of North American ice 
sheets.  The possible role of large ice shelves in 
the late Wisconsin history of Northern Hemi-
sphere ice sheets is discussed in Chapter 8, in-
cluding the following two points.  First, it is quite 
possible that large late Wisconsin ice shelves 
covered the Arctic Ocean and Baffin Bay; if so, 
they may have regulated outward flow through 
marine ice streams.  The effect of ice shelves in 
buttressing ice streams is discussed in Chapter 
7. Second, our discussion of deglaciation of 
northern marine ice assumes that the oldest 
shells from near the marine limit closely postdate 
grounding-line recession.  This ignores the pos-
sibility that the highest shell-bearing marine sed-
iments or beaches may reflect recession of ice-
shelf calving fronts rather than recession of ice-
shelf grounding lines.  In either case, the geologic 
record would miss a major element of deglacia-
tion-~namely, the prolonged downdraw through 
surging ice streams that preceded propagation of 
calving bays up former ice-stream channels.

ice tongues are weak links between ice shelves 
and ice streams partly because of surface warm-
ing by katabatic winds.  Surface warming de-
creases ice-hardness parameter A in the flow law 
of ice.   
  A rapid increase in the intensity of surface cre-
vasses seems to occur when ice streams move 
faster than about 500 m/yr.  Photographs of Ant-
arctic ice streams on both sides of this velocity 
threshold show the surface transformation 
(Swithinbank, 1964, 1977).  The ice-stream sur-
face is completely transformed from a relatively 
smooth featureless landscape to a chaotic jumble 
of large seracs and crevasses arrayed in alternat-
ing ridges and furrows aligned with the flow di-
rection.  This transformation also occurs during 
surges of mountain glaciers, so it is natural to 
conclude that fast-moving, heavily crevassed 
Antarctic ice streams are in a continuously surg-
ing state (Weertman, 1969).  However, a correla-
tion of the lengths of ice-stream tongues with the 
intensity of ice-stream crevassing suggests that 
surges come and go for some of the important ice 
streams supplying West Antarctic ice to the Ross 
Ice Shelf (Hughes, 1975).   
  Surface ablation of ice streams by katabatic 
winds is increased manyfold when ice-stream 
velocity crosses the surge threshold, because the 
change in crevasse intensity greatly increases the 
ice-stream surface area exposed to melting, evap-
oration, and sublimation.  Unevaporated surface 
meltwater flows into crevasses and refreezes be-
fore ice crosses the grounding line.  This warms 
the ice stream by releasing latent heat but does 
not contribute to ablation.  After ice crosses the 
grounding line, the bottom surface can also be-
come heavily crevassed, and water-filled bottom 
crevasses can migrate upward to meet surface 
crevasses.  The amount of surface meltwater that 
flows into surface crevasses and reaches water-
filled bottom crevasses without refreezing con-
tributes to surface ablation.  Since the latent heat 
of evaporation is over seven times the latent heat 
of melting, if only one-seventh of the surface 
meltwater enters crevasses and escapes refreez-
ing, it still causes as much surface ablation as 
evaporation does.  Surface ablation by sublima-
tion occurs primarily during the cold Antarctic 
night.  Sublimation is an important component of 
surface ablation on Antarctic glaciers (Bull and 
Carnein, 1970) and sublimation rates should in-
crease as dry katabatic winds respond to climatic 
warming.   
  Even if climatic warming does not throw the 
surface of an ice shelf into an ablation regime, 
thus creating a dendritic network of surface melt-
water streams that drain into crevasses in the ice-
stream and bedrock weak links of the ice shelf, 
climatic warming can affect ice-stream weak 
links if the ice streams are already in an ablation 
regime from katabatic winds and if their surface 
areas are already heavily crevassed by a surge.  
The major effect is to thin the ice stream by 
increasing surface ablation, so that the ice-stream 
grounding line is forced to retreat.   
  Basal melting along ice-shelf grounding lines 
has received little attention, and no attempt has 
been made to measure it directly.  This is unfor-
tunate, because determining whether ice-shelf 
grounding lines in Antarctica are currently re-
treating or advancing depends in large measure 
on the rates of melting or freezing along these 
grounding lines.  Hughes (1972, 1973) first sug-
gested that basal melting prevailed along Ross 
Ice Shelf grounding lines of the West Antarctic 
Ice Sheet, because most glacial geological and 
glaciological work by others seemed to indicate 
that the Ross Sea sector of the West Antarctic Ice 
Sheet continued to collapse in Holocene time 
after the disintegration of Northern Hemisphere 
ice sheets no longer contributed to rising sea 
level.  Basal melting along ice-shelf grounding 
lines, particularly where ice streams entered the 
ice shelf, seemed to be the best way to continue 
disintegration of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet; 
because basal melting would have the same ef-
fect as increasing sea level-~namely, by forcing 
ice-shelf grounding lines to retreat.   
  Using data from the RISS traverse, Hughes 
(1972) attempted to determine whether basal 
melting or freezing exists today along the Siple 
Coast grounding line of the Ross Ice Shelf.  His 
study is not generally available so it is repro-
duced here in amended form.  According to Fig-
ure 7-37, about the same degree of bending con-
verging flow occurs between the grounding line 
of ice stream C and RISS station 133 as occurs 
between RISS stations 133 and 53.  Insofar as the 
average ice hardness parameter ~~ depends on 
the stress field, it should be about the same for 
both flowline segments.  Applying equation (88) 
to the segment between RISS stations 133 and
53, we find

percents of major minerals by comparing diagnostic peak intensities with 
appropriate standards.

Step 3. Calculate modal analyses for the two samples of Topopah Spring
tuff by apportioning measured values of weight percent oxides among the 
phases detected by XRD and petrographic examination.

Step 4. Use the XRD data and modal mineralogies obtained in steps 2-3
to obtain: (1) X-ray absorption coefficients for the "pure" constituent 
minerals, and (2) "average" X-ray absorption coefficients for the bulk 
samples.

Step 5. Use calculated "pure" mineral peak intensities to prepare
determinative curves (peak intensity vs. weight percent of a mineral)
for tuffs with various "average" X-ray absorption coefficients.

Step 6. Using the determinative curves developed in step 5, the XRD
data obtained in step 2, and petrographic data, determine approximate
mineral percentages for the samples that were not analyzed chemically
[viz., Topopah Spring tuff (non-lithophysal zone), Calico Hills tuff,
and Bullfrog tuff].

As discussed in the Appendix, it is difficult to assign appropriate
uncertainties to the weight percents of minerals derived from X-ray
absorption calibration curves.  For smectite and alkali feldspar, the
estimated error is believed to be approximately 6-10% when the phase is 
abundant (~50 modal percent), but much greater, approximately 33%, when 
the phase is present in only minor amounts (~3 modal percent).  For 
reasons explained in the report, estimated errors in calculated weight 
percents of zeolites are believed to be somewhat larger than corre-
sponding values for smectite and alkali feldspar.

3.1.3 Major Results

1. Topopah Spring tuff from Busted Butte is similar texturally to the
samples of Topopah Spring tuff from borehole USWG1, but the outcrop
material and core material differ somewhat mineralogically.  For
example, the two core samples were found to have lower
quartz/cristobalite ratios. More importantly, however, the core
samples contain significant quantities of smectite (approximately 10%
by weight), whereas the outcrop material from Busted Butte contains
only trace amounts of smectite.

2. No major differences in bulk or clay mineralogy were detected among
the five size fractions of Busted Butte outcrop material. In fact, the
samples exhibited only one minor mineralogic variation: an apparent
decrease in quartz and a concomitant increase in alkali feldspar with
decreasing mesh size.

3.2 GROUNDWATER

Fifteen liters (4 gal) of J-13 well water were received from the U.S.
	At 25~ C and near pH 7 the uranyl carbonate, hydroxide, and pyro-
phosphate will react with sulfide to precipitate pitchblende which has a very 
small crystallite size.  The concentration of uranium in solution when    
either the uranyl carbonate or hydroxide reacts with the sulfide ion is less
than 10-6 M.  The uranyl pyrophosphate reaction with sulfide has been     
only qualitatively investigated.  Uranyl fluoride reacts with the sulfide
ion at 25~ C to precipitate uranium tetrafluoride, UF4.  The uranium in 
solution above UF4 is less than 10-6 M.  The sulfide ion has no effect on    
the solubility of uranium IV in solution other than to assist in keeping it 
in its reduced state.  The hydroxide ion, however, reacts with uranium IV    
at 25~ C near pH 7 to precipitate pitchblende.  It has a very small crystallite 
size.
     At the elevated temperature of 215~ C and near pH 7 uranyl carbonate, 
hydroxide, fluoride, and pyrophosphate react with sulfide, sulfite, and hy-
drogen gas to precipitate pitchblende which has a large crystallite size. 
The concentration of uranium in solution above the pitchblende is less than 
10-6 M, when sulfide ions react with uranyl carbonate, hydroxide and     
fluoride at 215~ C.  Uranium IV in an inert or H2S atmosphere at 215~ C
and near pH 7 reacts with water to precipitate pitchblende.  It has a large 
crystallite size.  The concentration of uranium in solution above the 
pitchblende is less than 10-6 M.
	Foreign cations are known to react with complex uranium ions and form 
precipitates.  They will also change the chemical properties of solutions,

PREPARATION OF MAP
The drainage basins above each gaging 
station were outlined on tracing paper laid 
over Geological Survey base maps of the United 
States, and the figures of average runoff were 
entered within the basin outlines. The base 
maps used were those showing drainage and re-
lief.

Wherever possible, opportunity was taken 
to calculate runoff from partial basin areas 
and thus define areal variations in runoff 
more closely. This was done by subtracting 
the flow at one or more upstream stations from
that at a downstream station. It must be rec-
ognized that the runoff thus computed for an 
intervening area commonly represents the dif-
ference between two comparatively large quan-
tities and is subject to a relatively large 
error either in the figures of discharge or in 
the drainage area. Nevertheless, such sub-
traction when expressed in terms of discharge 
per unit of area produces a result that is 
highly informative in connection with the 
study of the geographic distribution of runoff.

The runoff isograms were drawn so that 
the figure plotted would conform to the aver-
age runoff in each basin or partial basin. In 
basins where the runoff varied greatly, the 
delineation of the isograms was aided by study 
of the general pattern, by reference to pre-
cipitation, or by knowledge of the terrain. 
In such basins the extremes in runoff may be 
greatly in error - for example, along mountain
3. For snapshot simulations of, e.g., 50 or 100 m.y. ago, the paleogeogra-
phy and SST boundary conditions and the paleoclimatic data used for com-
parison with the simulated results are averaged over a 1- to 5-m.y. period.  
Therefore, the distribution of solar radiation with latitude and season should 
be an average calculated over many cycles of orbital periodicities.

   5.4.5.  Atmospheric Aerosol Content.  It is well known from both observa-
tions and climate modeling (Toon and Pollack, 1980; Turco et al., 1982) that 
atmospheric aerosols can affect climate.  This is because they scatter and 
absorb shortwave radiation and absorb and emit infrared radiation (IR) 
(Prospero et al., 1983).  Observations of surface temperature anomalies 
following major volcanic eruptions and the results of climate modeling 
indicate that stratospheric aerosols increase the temperature in the lower 
stratosphere and reduce surface temperature.  This is because the effect due 
to the increase in planetary albedo is greater than that due to the absorption 
and emission of IR (Pollack et al., 1976).
   Stratospheric aerosol content is closely related to one source, explosive 
volcanic eruptions that periodically inject silicate dust particles and sulfur 
gases (H2S, SO2) into the stratosphere.  The sulfur gases are converted 
through photochemical reactions to sulfuric acid particles.  After major 
eruptions, stratospheric aerosols decline to background levels after 1-2 yr 
(Castleman et al., 1974).  While the mean global atmospheric optical depth 
(~) due to aerosol is in the range 0.05 to 0.2 (Deirmendjian, 1971; Pollack et 
al., 1976), and major eruptions can increase this to 0.4-0.5 for several 
months, the mean volcanic contribution over the last few centuries to total 
atmospheric aerosol ~ has been ~0.02, constituting about 80% of the total 
stratospheric aerosol ~ (Pollack et al., 1976).  Therefore, periods of en-
hanced volcanic activity in the geological past could have had climatic effects 
through increased ~.  Approximate estimates of the variation of strato-
spheric aerosol content can be made, given a knowledge of changes in the 
global rate of volcanism through time.  This could be achieved by the follow-
ing methods.

   1. Major volcanic episodes (lasting maybe a few million years) can be 
recognized in the geologic record from widespread and thick ash horizons 
(Axelrod, 1981).  However, there is insufficient data to document changes 
in the global rate of volcanism with any confidence.
   2. The global average ocean floor spreading rate slowly varies over tens of 
millions of years.  This must affect mean rates of volcanism at midocean 
ridges and in island arcs and Andean mountain belts along destructive plate 
margins.  Hays and Pitman (1973) argued that the mean ocean floor spread-
ing rate between 110 and 85 m.y. ago was double the present value [although
during the last few hundred years (125).  It may also 
signify a decrease in local weed (NAP) pollen produc-
tion, to be expected when a pueblo or other prehistoric 
village was abandoned.  An apparent increase in tree 
pollen would accompany the decrease in herb pollen 
following abandonment and the end of disturbance by 
man, without benefit of forest expansion or climatic 
change.
   In brief, the major features of postpluvial climatic 
history are threefold: an initial arid period (zone IV) 
climatically equivalent to the present and dating 8,000 
-~ 10,500 B. P.; next, a less arid interval (zone III) 
with an intensified monsoon rainfall, the climate per-
haps no warmer but slightly wetter than at present, and 
corresponding in time to the classic "altithermal," 4,000 
to 8,000 B. P.; and finally an arid period (zones I and 
II) closely resembling present conditions but with at 
least one possible shift in the seasonal distribution of 
rainfall and lasting from 4,000 B. P. to the present.  
There is a strong resemblance to the classic threefold 
postglacial pollen sequence of von Post.
IX.  A REAPPRAISAL OF POSTPLUVIAL CLIMATES
  Recent pollen analysis of pluvial lake sediments 
sustains the view of most geologists that glacio-pluvial 
climates of arid America were decidedly colder and 
wetter than the present.  It is within the postpluvial pe-
riod that the desert grassland pollen chronology fails 
to support the climatic interpretations of certain pre-
vious workers.  Foremost is lack of pollen evidence of 
pluvial conditions at the Sulphur Spring stage type 
locality (profile of Double Adobe I).
   According to Antevs (151) "The bones of the 
extinct animals, the much greater moisture indicated 
by the hickory, the permanent river, and the lakelet 
show that ~~~~~ the beds ~~~~~ were deposited during the 
last Pluvial, the correlative of the last glaciation in 
western North America." In 1942, Bryan visited the Sul-
phur Spring valley and confirmed Antevs' interpreta-
tion that the alluvial beds of the Sulphur Spring stage 
were deposited at a time wetter than the present (27).  
But the pollen record of Sulphur Spring stage sediments 
bears no resemblance to the pollen of pluvial-age sedi-
ments of the Willcox Playa and makes a pluvial climate 
and age virtually impossible.
   A second and perhaps more provocative discovery 
is the high frequency of moisture indicators including 
tree pollen in the middle of the postpluvial pollen rec-
ord.  This suggests a moist, not a dry altithermal.  It 
led me to re-examine the Bryan-Antevs model of post-
pluvial climates which is commonplace in the literature 
of Southwestern prehistory.  The discord does not in-
volve the Bryan-Antevs alluvial chronology, based on 
reasonably secure field evidence of synchronous epi-
sodes of deposition and erosion in Southwestern flood
SECTION 5.-~ILLUSTRATIONS OF GEOLOGICAL STRUCTURE.

It is customary to consult the older and usually the more thoroughly    
consolidated stratified rocks for illustration of geological structure, but as 
such features are in many cases the records of the manner in which the 
beds were deposited, it is evident that they should occur in the newest as 
well as the oldest formations. It is well known that the history of the earth 
is a continuous record, however fragmentary it may seem at the present 
day, and that the processes of nature have been the same throughout the 
geological ages.  Nowhere are these axioms more thoroughly sustained 
than in the recently desiccated lake basins of the Far West. As the gravels 
and finer sediments deposited in Lake Lahontan afford many instructive      
records of the circumstances under which they were accumulated, we have 
prepared the following brief summary of observations relating to geologic 
structure due to deposition, erosion, etc., believing that it will assist in inter-
preting similar phenomena when observed in older rocks, where they are 
frequently obscured by metamorphism and other changes.

          STRATIFICATION AND LAMINATION.

The sediments forming the upper and lower portions of the Lahontan      
section consist of fine, homogeneous, evenly-stratified marly-clays, which 
show a distinct lamination parallel with the planes of bedding.  Attention 
is called to the lamination of these deposits in connection with other features 
due to deposition, as it has manifestly resulted from the slow accumulation 
of fine sediments in thin layers, and does not owe its existence to pressure, 
as is the case in many older rocks.  This is evident since both the upper 
and lower clays are alike laminated, while the higher members of the series 
at least have never been subjected to the pressure of superimposed deposits.

               CURRENT BEDDING.

The gravels separating the upper and lower Lahontan clays are char-
acterized by extreme irregularity, and afford many illustrations of structure 
due to deposition. They were deposited in the shallow waters and were 
much agitated by waves and currents, and among other features present
and, (ii) that
estimated consumptive use by man for that year was added to 
the actual volume, giving an adjusted volume and correspond-
ing surface area. The increase in area was multiplied by the 
estimated rate of evaporation to calculate the increase in 
evaporation loss. Subtracting this evaporation loss from the 
first adjusted volume gave a final adjusted volume and a net 
gain in volume for the year equal to man's consumptive use 
less the increased evaporation loss. The net gain in volume was 
then added to the volume corresponding to the observed mean 
elevation for the next year (1852), and the computations were 
repeated. The evaporation factor was applied only to the 
computed increase in area; the actual evaporation loss from 
the total lake surface did not enter into the computations.
  Computations for the entire period of record were run on a 
digital computer, using a program prepared by E. L. Peck, and 
another computation was also run for the period of statehood, 
1896-~1965. The mean annual elevations of Great Salt Lake 
for the period 1851-~1965, adjusted for the computed effects 
of man's consumptive use, are plotted along with the observed 
elevations in figure 3. Results of the computation for 
1896-~1965 gave the same adjusted elevation for 1965. The 
computed cumulative reduction in lake elevation caused by 
consumptive use of water in the drainage basin for the period 
1851-~1965 was 5.28 feet.

valuable, because the time of the split-dose x-ray exposure can be clearly 
specified.
   On January 1, 1970, the group not re-treated with a second course 
numbered 4,420 patients still alive and 1,759 who had died (477 had 
emigrated or were otherwise lost to followup). A more extensive report 
of this followup has been made available to the Committee (R. Doll 
and P. G. Smith, personal communication) and was included in the

   Unfortunately, no radiation-exposure data for these patients have been
published since the original very detailed analysis in 1957.22 In the 
following section, the doses delivered to various tissues in this group 
are estimated. We believe that these estimates are valid at least to 
within 50%, and they have been used to calculate risk estimates from 
the epidemiologic evidence of excess cancers (by site) observed in these 
patients.

ESTIMATES OF RADIATION DOSES IN TISSUES AND ORGANS 
IN THE SINGLE-COURSE RADIOTHERAPY PATIENTS TREATED 
FOR ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS IN ENGLAND AND WALES

The available data on patients with ankylosing spondylitis who received 
a single treatment course with x rays in the Doll and Smith study26,73 
were reviewed, to estimate average radiation doses in tissues and organs 
giving rise to excess leukemias and cancers of heavily irradiated sites. 
It was not possible to review the radiotherapy charts of each patient, 
and it was therefore necessary to make assumptions on, for example, 
the selection of patients, the extent and severity of disease, the method 
of therapy, the radiotherapy dosimetry and exposures, the tissues ir-
radiated, and the doses absorbed. The number of assumptions was kept 
to a minimum; it was recognized that the selection of patients and the 
clinical courses of treatment chosen by the radiotherapist in individual 
cases were, understandably, extremely variable. In spite of these limita-
tions, however, it has been possible to make reasonable assumptions 
and to develop a model of what probably occurred in the radiotherapy 
planning and treatment of these patients, on the basis of conventional 
orthovoltage radiotherapy of the 1930s-1950s. The estimates of radiation 
doses absorbed thus derived, however, are imprecise and must be further 
corrected as new information becomes available, not only with respect 
to the assumptions made above, but also with respect to subtle informa-
tion still lacking-~for example, on the location of the organ during 
treatment and on the fraction of the organ or tissue that was irradiated.

Introduction  

The electrochemical nature of corrosion would be only of 
minor or academic interest to the corrosion engineer if it 
provided merely an additional method of measuring average 
corrosion rate.   The standard gravimetric method of weigh-
ing the amount of metal reacted during a specified time can 
yield adequate accuracy when good descaling procedures 
are used.   The gravimetric method is generally satisfactory 
and is still widely used in investigating corroding systems of 
industrial importance.   Corrosion rate measured by metal 
weight loss is, however, an average value over a relatively 
long reaction time.
       The electrochemical nature of corrosion provides a 
means of determining an almost instantaneous corrosion 
rate.   Over the time interval required to obtain a gravimetric 
corrosion rate, one can follow electrochemically how the 
rate varies with time.   The mean corrosion rate, obtained by 
integration of the rate/time curve, should be equal to the 
rate obtained by descaled weight loss.
       Consider the reaction of iron in sulfuric acid to form 
ferrous sulfate:
or by the rate of the cathodic process: 
where D is the metal density in g cm-3, d = day, and y = 
year.
       Unfortunately, one cannot simply hook up an ammeter 
to any naturally corroding metal and measure the current 
equivalent to the instantaneous corrosion rate, because this 
current is internally shorted.   There are, however, three 
fundamental concepts which can be brought into play to 
develop electrochemical techniques for measuring corrosion 
rate.

Fundamental Concepts  

Tafel Equation
      In 1905, Tafel1 found that the current I equivalent to 
the rate of a single electrode reaction on a metal surface is 
related to the potential of the metal by
where E is the potential measured with respect to a selected 
reference electrode, a and b being constants.  The Tafel 
equation has been confirmed experimentally for a wide 
variety of individual anodic and cathodic reactions. Con-
stants a and b can be predicted theoretically for many 
reaction mechanisms.2 For the purpose of this report, the 
Tafel slope, b ~~~ dE/d log I, is considered an experimental 
quantity characteristic of a particular anodic process (ba) or 
cathodic process (bc), not a theoretical quantity calculated 
from the reaction model.

Additivity Principle
      A naturally corroding metal always has more than one 
electrochemical process occurring on its surface at a 
measurable rate.   These must include at least one anodic 
process and one cathodic.   If external current is applied to 
the corroding metal to change its potential, the potential 
change affects the rates of all electrochemical processes at 
the metal surface.   This is depicted graphically in Figure 1.
  The system represented in Figure 1 is a generalized 
corroding metal on which there are three reactions desig-
nated by prime, double prime, and triple prime, and three 
reactions having reversible potentials, Er', Er'', Er'''.   
The lines represent linear Tafel (E vs log I) plots for the 
anodic and cathodic processes of each reaction.   The current 
for any one of these processes is referred to as a partial 
current, and it represents the rate of that process.

cracks to be transgranular and Royuela and Staehle 
detected both intergranular and transgranular cracking.
       There is a clear trend for susceptibility to cracking to 
follow the nickel content regardless of the crystal structure 
(ferritic vs austenitic) and alloy base (Fe, Fe-Cr, Fe-Cr-Mn).
       The effect of chromium variation on the Fe-Ni base has 
not been so extensively studied.   The first extensive study 
by Denhard85 showed that increasing chromium in a 
Fe-12Ni base increased its susceptibility to cracking in 
boiling MgCl2.   His data are summarized in Figure 54.  A 
range of Ni-Cr variations has been studied by both Truman 
and Perry119 (10-25 Cr, 15-45 Ni) and Evans and Burr120 
(16-35 Cr, 8-41 Ni).   These results tend to show a minimum 
in cracking generally at 20% Cr with less susceptibility at 
higher and lower chromium.   The work of Truman and 
Perry was more specific with respect to cracking times.
   They also investigated MgCl2, CaCl2, 3 and 10% NaCl at 
250 C, NaCl at 330 C, condensing steam and caustic with 
most tests being in tension.  Typical results from their work 
are summarized in Figure 55.   Royuela and Staehle107 have 
investigated the effect of a broad range of chromium and
in the solution annealed (705 C) condition.  Steel A was 
hardened to Rc 19 by annealing (705 C), air cooling, 
austenitizing (982 C), oil quenching and tempering at 649 
C, and to Rc 34 by tempering at 538 C. Steel B was 
hardened to Rc 18 as above but was tempered at 593 C. 
Steel B was tempered at 510 C in order to obtain a hardness 
of Rc 34.  As can be seen from the above tempering 
temperatures, the two steels respond to tempering slightly 
differently.   Likewise, the mechanical properties are some-
what different as can be seen from Table 2.  The structures 
were fully martensitic when hardened and tempered.
       In order to determine whether steels A and B had 
different responses to other chemical media and to electro-
chemical polarization, wires were prepared from each steel 
and tests were conducted in apparatus resembling van 
Rooyen's.3  Media evaluated (besides 42% boiling MgCl2) 
included: dilute HCl + SeO2, dilute H2SO4 + SeO2, dilute 
acetic acid + (NH4)2S, boiling 3% NaCl, and boiling 3% 
NaCl + CS2.   Although many tests were performed with 
anodic, cathodic and no applied currents (at several tensile 
loads), only little differences were found in the behavior of 
steels A and B-~except in MgCl2 without applied currents.
   Only Steel B appeared susceptible to stress corrosion 
cracking in boiling 42% by weight MgCl2 without an 
applied current.   The environments purported to accelerate 
hydrogen embrittlement (such as dilute acetic acid + 
(NH4)2S) acted more quickly upon Steel A but both steels 
did crack, and fracture paths appeared to be very similar.   In 
fact, the crack path in all environments, for both steels, was 
extremely similar.   The cracks follow an intergranular path 
associated with the prior austenite grains.  The one major 
exception, is the crack path in Steel B when tested in 
boiling 42% MgCl2 either without an applied current or 
with anodic polarization.   As can be seen from Figures 1, 2,
3, and 4 the cracks have more of a transgranular 
appearance, as well as much more branching.  Figures 5 and 
6 are examples of cracks in other media or under cathodic 
polarization.
       I believe that these data do show that although the 12% 
chromium martensitic steels are susceptible to hydrogen 
embrittlement and anodic accelerated cracking, the 
presence of 1.76% Ni in the alloy leads to a unique cracking 
behavior in boiling 42% MgCl2 without any applied current.

not only occur at the grain boundaries, but on slip bands 
and pearlite lamellae as well, and this causes a renewed 
decrease in the time to fracture.   In an annealed 0.28% C 
steel, Zabik1 did not observe such effects.   The time to 
fracture decreased regularly with increasing load.  This was 
evidently due to the much lower ductility of that steel 
when compared with low-carbon iron and annealed 0.14%

Concentration vs Boiling Temperature of 
Magnesium Chloride Solutions  

M. A. Streicher and I. B. Casale

Introduction

      The temperature of boiling magnesium chloride solu-
tions, which are used to detect the susceptibility of stainless 
steel alloys to stress corrosion cracking has a pronounced 
effect on the measured time to failure.   A discrepancy 
between the boiling-point-concentration relationship was 
brought to our attention when a series of 42 wt % solutions 
was prepared in the Engineering Materials Laboratory and a 
boiling point observed that was apparently low by almost 
10 C compared with values often cited in the literature.   In 
an attempt to resolve this discrepancy, atmospheric 
boiling-point data were assembled from the literature for 
MgCl2 solutions in the 0-46 wt % concentration range.  
These data were supplemented by new experimental 
determinations on 40-46 wt % MgCl2-~the concentration 
range of greatest interest in stress corrosion tests-~for which 
little information was available.
       The concentration in general use was apparently 
proposed by Scheil,1 who reported preparing a "solution 
containing approximately 1375 gm of MgCl2 ~ 6H2O and 
150 ml H2O boiling at 309 F (154 C)...   This solution 
contains about 42 wt % MgCl2.  Numerous authors2-5 have 
cited this paper and have reported preparing 42 wt % MgCl2 
solutions with boiling points of 154 C.
      In 1961 Barnartt and van Rooyen6 called attention to 
the inconsistency in the reported boiling point.   They 
measured a boiling point of 146 C at 730 mm Hg for a 42.5 
wt % MgCl2.   These data, when corrected to 760 mm Hg, 
yield a value of 147.0 C, in good agreement with data 
published by Pershke and Kalinin7 in 1932, which plot to

or, replacing n by ~t,
       Equation 7.17 relates the mean square displacement to 
the microscopic properties of jump distance and jump 
frequency.  Since the random-walk process on which 
Eq. 7.17 is based is identical to a diffusion process, the 
mean square displacement can also be computed from a 
completely macroscopic viewpoint by application of the 
appropriate solution of Eq. 7.7 to the random-walk prob-
lem just considered: at t = 0, N impurity atoms are intro-
duced to a very restricted region of a host crystal, which 
shall be taken as the origin. As a consequence of diffusion 
(or random hopping, which is synonymous), the N atoms 
spread out from the origin in a manner described by the
concentration distribution C(r,t), which is obtained by 
solving Eq. 7.7.  The form of Fick's second law appropriate 
to this problem is

reconstruction from rainfall data. Reconstructed flood peaks based 
on rainfall analyses of the 1976 Big Thompson storm for the two 
basins are 153 and 110 m3/s (Miller and others, 1978) (Table 6).   
These values are also closer to the paleohydraulic values than are 
the slope-area estimates.   Thus, two independent indirect discharge 
estimates give peak discharge estimates similar to those calculated 
by the paleohydraulic technique developed here, but significantly 
less than the published conventional slope-area discharge estimates 
(Table 6).   These results support the suggestion that excessive chan-
nel scour in small mountain tributaries could cause slope-area dis-
charge estimates to be too large.
       A second explanation for why most paleohydraulic recon-
structed discharges on small streams are lower than those estimated 
by slope-area techniques may be that slope-area methods require 
the estimation of a roughness coefficient (n).   Typical values consis-
tently selected for large floods in small mountain channels are n = 
0.035 to 0.06.   Research on verification of roughness coefficients for 
steep mountain channels recently completed (R. D. Jarrett, unpub. 
data) indicates that these n values may be too low by factors of 1.5 
to 2.0. Higher values would reduce velocities and result in lower 
slope-area discharge estimates.
       Finally, the fundamental assumptions that particles of all sizes 
are available for transport in small, steep mountain valleys and that 
flood velocity and depth (actually depth-slope product) are 
reflected in the size of boulders in flood deposits must be examined.
Large floods may have been able to move boulders larger than 
those that were available.   This may be the case in Sawmill Gulch 
(Table 6, site 9), which follows a major shear zone along which 
uranium enrichment occurs (Sims and Sheridan, 1964).   Fault 
movements have crushed and broken the bedrock along closely 
spaced joints and fractures, and consequently there are no very 
large boulders available to be moved during a large flood.   The
second assumption, that average velocity and depth can be recon-
structed from particle size with reasonable accuracy, requires that 
the methods selected, premises, and numerical values estimated rea-
sonably approximate processes and conditions in the field.  Unfor-
tunately, the hazards entailed in compiling actual measurements 
and observations during catastrophic floods preclude any substan-
tial direct empirical corroboration.

while the soil is wet and conductive enough to supply water to the site of 
evaporation at a rate commensurate with the evaporative demand. During 
this stage, the evaporation rate is limited by, and hence also controlled by, 
external meteorological conditions (i.e., radiation, wind, air humidity, etc.)
rather than by the properties of the soil profile.  As such, this stage, being 
weather controlled, is analogous to the flux-controlled stage of infiltration (in 
contrast with the profile-controlled stage; see Sections B and H, on rain 
infiltration, in Chapter 12).  The evaporation rate during this stage might also
be influenced by soil surface conditions, including surface reflectivity and 
the possible presence of a mulch, insofar as these can modify the effect of the 
meterorological factors acting on the soil.  In a dry climate, this stage of 
evaporation is generally brief and may last only a few hours to a few days.

stage, the evaporation rate is limited or dictated by the rate at which the

may persist for a much longer period than the first stage.
    (3)  A residual slow-rate stage, which is established eventually and which 
may persist at a nearly steady rate for many days, weeks, or even months.  This 
stage apparently comes about after the surface-zone has become so desiccated 
that further liquid-water conduction through it effectively ceases.  Water 
transmission through the desiccated layer thereafter occurs primarily by the 
slow process of vapor diffusion, and it is affected by the vapor diffusivity of 
the dried surface zone and by the adsorptive forces acting over molecular 
distances at the particle surfaces.  This stage is often called the vapor diffusion 
stage and can be important where the surface layer is such that it becomes 
quickly desiccated (e.g., a loose assemblage of clods).

    Whereas the transition from the first to the second stage is generally a 
sharp one, the second stage generally blends into the third stage so gradually 
that the last two cannot be separated so easily.  A qualitative explanation for 
the occurrence of these stages follows.
    During the initial stage, the soil surface gradually dries out and soil 
moisture is drawn upward in response to steepening evaporation-induced 
gradients.  The rate of evaporation can remain nearly constant as long as the 
moisture gradients toward the surface compensate for the decreasing hy-
draulic conductivity (resulting from the decrease in water content).  In terms 
of Darcy's law, q = K(d~/dz), we can restate the above principle by noting 
that the flux q remains constant because the gradient d~/dz increases suffi-
ciently to offset the decrease of K.  Sooner or later, however, the soil surface
approaches equilibrium with the overlying atmosphere (i.e., becomes ap-
proximately air dry).  From this moment on, the moisture gradients toward 
the surface cannot increase any more, and in fact, must tend to decrease as
for the purposes of those research and other 
studies in which no direct benefit to the per-
sons irradiated is intended, in circumstances 
when the exposure is unrelated to any illness 
they may have, should only be undertaken by 
properly qualified and trained persons.   Such 
irradiation should only be given with the 
consent of the authorities in charge of the 
institution where the irradiation is to take 
place, as advised by an appropriate expert 
body and subject to local and national regula-
tions.  The estimated risks of the irradiation 
should be explained to those involved, who 
should be volunteers fully able to exercise 
their free will.   The higher the dose the more 
rigorous should be the requirements on the 
conditions of securing true volunteers and on 
their capability of understanding the risk.   It 
follows that the irradiation, for the purposes
of such studies, of children and other persons 
regarded as being incapable of giving their 
true consent should only be undertaken if the 
expected radiation dose is low (e.g. of the 
order of one-tenth of the dose-equivalent 
limits applicable to individual members of the 
public) and if valid approval has been given by 
those legally responsible for such persons.   
The individuals exposed under these condi-
tions obtain no direct benefit from their 
exposure and it is therefore necessary to 
ensure that their detriment remains accept-
able, and thus to set authorized limits.   How-
ever, the magnitude of the detriment associ-
ated with the exposure depends on the age and 
the state of health of the exposed individual 
and it is not possible to fix limits of general 
applicability.   Appropriate limits should 
therefore be authorized for each research 
program.

The optimization of exposure      

(205) The Commission wishes to re-
emphasize that careful attention to techniques 
would, in many cases, result in a considerable 
reduction of the dose due to medical proced-
ures, without impairment of their value.   In 
general, the techniques and equipment used 
should allow:
the reduction of the doses received by 
tissues in the region of the body under 
examination to the minimum compatible 
with obtaining the necessary information 
in the particular patient;
the delivery to the treated region of the 
body of a therapeutic dose the magnitude 
of which is most likely to ensure the re-
quired response;
the limitation as far as practicable of the 
exposure of other parts of the body.       

(206) Because of the risk of radiation injury 
to any embryo or foetus, the possibility of 
pregnancy is one of the factors to be con-
sidered in deciding whether to make a radio-
logical examination involving the lower 
abdomen in a woman of reproductive 
capacity.  Although such an examination is 
least likely to pose any hazard to a developing 
embryo if carried out during the 10 day 
interval following the onset of menstruation, 
attention should always be paid to details of 
radiological technique that would ensure 
minimization of exposure to any embryo or 
foetus that may be present, whether or not the 
women is known to be pregnant.

(207) Before prescribing an examination or 
investigation, the responsible practitioner 
should satisfy himself that the necessary 
information is not already available from 
other previous examinations and investiga-
tions.

Professional training

(208) The Commission wishes to emphasize 
the importance of including adequate training 
on radiation protection in the general educa-
tion and training of individuals entering the 
medical and associated professions, since all 
those who enter these professions may be 
involved in prescribing procedures involving 
exposure to ionizing radiation.   More 
thorough training in radiation protection is 
required by those planning to enter the field of 
radiology and by scientists and technicians 
assisting in the medical uses of radiation.

    Because D(~) typically increases rapidly with increasing ~ (e.g. Rose 1968, Reichardt

viding ~L ~~ ~f.  Hence over most of the column ~ will be approximately uniform,

~ declines with time.  We will now assume that the rate of outflow, F, is given by

tively independent of x, but not of t.  This is tantamount to saying that, apart from

so until ~L approaches ~f, when D varies little with x, and Doering's (1965) method

reasonable one is illustrated in Fig. 2, which shows ~~/~t (normalized with respect to

traverse.  The boundaries then were projected directly 
from the photographs onto the topographic base maps.      
  Mapping of the gravel fans involved sufficient tra-
verses on each fan to identify the gravel deposits ac-
cording to their distinctive color and tone on the aerial 
photographs.  The boundaries of the several formations 
then were sketched with much generalization on the 
photographs, and these lines were transferred by pro-
jection and inspection to the topographic base.  In gen-
eral, the boundaries of the older of the late Pleistocene 
gravel (No. 2 gravel) are shown by the contours; the 
younger gravels commonly are in such small areas that a 
great deal of generalization was necessary, so much so 
that accurate projection onto the topographic base 
seemed an overrefinement.
  The lower parts of the mountains were mapped on 
the ground.  For the most part the traverses were 
along the valleys and along the ridges, although this is 
at right angles to the contacts.  The higher parts of 
the mountains were mapped by helicopter.  Within 
limits, this mapping from the air could be checked by 
tracing the formations to the lower parts of the moun-
tains where mapping had been done on the ground and 
where fossil collections had helped control it.  Later, 
some of the most questionable areas were checked by 
traverses down the ridges and canyons from the summit 
of the Panamint Range to the floor of Death Valley.     
  In the course of mapping the Paleozoic formations, 
about 100 collections of fossils were obtained.  Their 
locations are shown on the geologic map, and the con-
tents of most of the collections are described with the 
formations.  It is expected that future work will show 
that the formations in some fault blocks have been in-
correctly identified, but the fossil collections show the 
limits to which such corrections may be extended.     
  Fieldwork was interrupted while parts of the study 
still were incomplete. In particular, the Tertiary for-
mations, the granitic intrusions, and the older of the 
Precambrian sedimentary formations need more study.

Figure 14.--Graph showing phenocrysts and lithic variations in the tuff of Lithic Ridge.
Bedded and Ash-Flow Tuff       

The tuff of Lithic Ridge is underlain by approximately 13 m of tuffaceous 
sediments, with a thin (approximately 9 m) ash-flow tuff intercalated with the 
tuffaceous sediments.   This thin ash-flow tuff is very light gray to light 
greenish gray, partially welded, and contains 15-20 percent phenocrysts.   The 
phenocrysts consist of plagioclase, biotite, and sparse sanidine and quartz.  
The ash flow apparently has the same phenocryst composition (table 6) and 
probably correlates with a thin ash-flow tuff that is present in USW G-1 at 
1656-1661 m (F. M. Byers, Jr., oral commun., 1982).   This thin ash flow in USW 
G-1 is the uppermost ash flow of unit C, which is the lowest unit of the 
"older ash-flow and bedded tuffs" of USW G-1 (Spengler and others, 1982).   
Unit C is approximately 173 m thick in USW G-1, and thins drastically north of 
the USW G-1 drill site.   No other units of the "older ash-flow and bedded 
tuffs" of USW G-1 were identified in USW G-2.  
these units are left informally designated as the red 
sandstone unit in White Basin and east of Frenchman 
Mountain, and as the rocks of the Grand Wash trough 
in the Grand Wash area, throughout this report.    
  The Hualapai Limestone presents a special nomen-
clature problem because it is commonly called a formal 
member of the Muddy Creek Formation in recent liter-
ature (Blair, 1978; Blair and Armstrong, 1979; and Luc-
chitta, 1972, 1979).  Its member status is chiefly based 
upon the fact that limestone is interbedded with red 
sandstone at the base of the main body of Hualapai 
Limestone at Grapevine Mesa, and the red sandstone 
has traditionally been termed Muddy Creek.  In this 
report, however, the red sandstone that is interbedded 
with the limestone of the Hualapai is considered to be 
part of the rocks of the Grand Wash trough rather than 
part of the Muddy Creek.  On this basis, it is better to 
refer to the Hualapai as part of the rocks of the Grand 
Wash trough rather than as a member of the Muddy 
Creek.  However, the Hualapai extends to the west of 
Grapevine Mesa beyond the western limits of the under-
lying red sandstone, where it rests directly on Precam-
brian crystalline rocks.  It ultimately extends into 
Detrital Valley, where it rests on rocks called Muddy 
Creek Formation.  Because the stratigraphic relations of 
the Hualapai with the Muddy Creek in Detrital Valley 
are incompletely understood owing to a paucity of pub-
lished maps and accurate descriptions there, and be-
cause the Hualapai interfingers with informally named 
rocks in the Grand Wash trough, it is left unassociated 
with either the rocks of the Grand Wash trough or the 
Muddy Creek; it is restored here to its original forma-
tional rank (Longwell, 1936) and referred to simply as 
the Hualapai Limestone.
  The Muddy Creek Formation of Stock (1921) is 
slightly reevaluated in this report in that the use of that 
term is restricted somewhat.  Only rocks that can be 
demonstrated to have been stratigraphically continuous 
with those of the Muddy Creek type locality are called 
Muddy Creek Formation.

AGE OF THE TERTIARY ROCKS

   The precise age of the Tertiary nonmarine sedimen-
tary rocks in the Lake Mead region has been poorly doc-
mented largely because fossils are rare to nonexistent, 
and because some important unconformities were not 
detected.  Although Anderson and others (1972) report 
24 K-Ar determinations from igneous rocks associated 
with the nonmarine sedimentary rocks, the authors did 
not agree among themselves (Anderson and others, 
1972, p. 283) that the age determinations were repre-
sentative of the age of the sedimentary rocks.  The 
disagreement focused upon whether the ages were 
determined from lava flows interbedded with the sedi-
mentary rocks or from younger shallow intrusive rocks, 
and on whether or not the dates from demonstrated ex-
trusive rocks were reset by thermal effects from nearby 
intrusive rocks.  Several additional factors must be con-
sidered concerning the dates presented by Anderson 
and others (1972).  The lower part of the section was 
never dated by them, even in Rainbow Gardens, and 
they still considered it to be possibly Cretaceous in age.  
Also, saline minerals present throughout the Horse 
Spring Formation suggest that the associated ground 
water was capable of altering volcanic rocks2 and of 
subsequently chemically adjusting the apparent K-Ar 
ages.  In addition, the ages reported by Anderson and 
others (1972) were grouped and referred to in terms of 
the confusing system of stratigraphic nomenclature in 
existence at the time and they, therefore, must be 
reevaluated in the light of newly documented strati-
graphic relations.
  Twenty-five fission-track age determinations were 
made on zircon extracted from basal tuff beds inter- 
preted to be of air-fall origin interbedded with the other 
Tertiary sedimentary rocks.  The fission-track dating 
method was chosen for several reasons: zircon is pres-
ent, is not susceptible to alteration, and has a high 
resistance to track annealing upon heating.  Also, 
fission-track dating of zircon, which is rich in uranium, 
works especially well in Tertiary rocks.  The age-
determination procedure follows that of Naeser (1976), 
and lab work was done in Naeser's lab under his 
guidance.
  Two important assumptions must be made when eval-
uating fission-track age determinations as primary 
ages.  It must be assumed that the dated rock has not 
endured a heating event later than its original forma-
tion, or that it has not undergone a prolonged cooling 
history.  Also, it must be assumed that the dated grains 
are not detrital and have had the same thermal history 
as the encompassing rock.  The inferred air-fall origin 
and the limited stratigraphic thickness of the dated  
tuffs suggest that they have not undergone a slow cool-
ing history, and their mineralogy indicates that they 
have not been postdepositionally heated beyond the 
annealing temperature of zircon.  Naeser (written com-
munication, 1978) has  demonstrated that the approx-
imate annealing temperature of zircon through geologic 
time is about 175~-200~C. The presence of both heu-
landite3 and analcime in the dated tuffs suggests that  
most widespread, and the stromatolitic mound sub-
facies, which apparently occurs only in the upper one-
fourth of the member in Lovell Wash.  A conglomeratic 
lithofacies, also exposed in Lovell Wash, is the southern 
stratigraphic equivalent of the stromatolitic mound 
subfacies, and it is distributed near large faults.  Near 
Lava Butte the Bitter Ridge consists of sandstone and 
intraformational breccia, which are grouped with the 
conglomerate as the clastic lithofacies.     
   Both subfacies of the stromatolitic limestone appear 
to have originated as sediment in a lacustrine environ-
ment.  The tabular nature of the member; the parallel, 
continuous bedding; and the fine, uniform laminations 
of the wavy-bedded subfacies support the lacustrine 
origin.  A lacustrine environment provides the even, 
widespread surface necessary to develop such bedding, 
whereas few other nonmarine environments could.  Ap-
parently the lake was relatively free of detrital influx, 
because the limestone contains only widely dispersed 
grains of siliceous clastic material and no sand-sized
Ammonia Tanks near the apex of the Timber Mountain 
resurgent dome (fig. 18).  The pipes are localized along the
faulted margin of a northwest-trending central graben, 
described by Carr and Quinlivan (1968, p. 105).   The 
central parts of the pipes are light gray and devitrified, 
whereas the border zones are generally glassy or finely 
spherulitic.   In a few places a crystallized transitional 
border zone as much as 15 m (50 ft) wide contains 
alternating bands of rhyolite having different phenocryst 
contents and probably represents a zone of intermixed 
intrusive high-silica rhyolite and remobilized quartz latite 
wallrock of the Ammonia Tanks Member.   The modal 
range of three specimens and the silica content of 76.8 
percent approach the composition of a typical high-silica 
rhyolite of the Ammonia Tanks Member (fig. 21).
      The inferred relations among the Ammonia Tanks 
Member in the Timber Mountain resurgent dome, the 
petrologically related intrusives, and an inferred under- 
lying compositionally zoned magma chamber are shown 
in figure 22.   The two-layer compositional zoning of the 
upper part of a large magma chamber is based on models 
suggested by Quinlivan and Lipman (1965), by Lipman, 
Christiansen, and O'Connor (1966), and by Smith and 
Bailey (1966).   The inward-dipping tuff dikes formed from 
high-silica rhyolite magma near the apical part of the 
magma chamber and are somewhat analogous to cone 
sheets (Anderson, 1936).   The rhyolite intrusives of East

                              INTRODUCTION

  Detailed knowledge of the pattern of intraplate stress pro-
vides important constraints on models of global tectonic proc-
esses and the mechanism of plate motions.  On a finer scale, 
both the pattern of stress and variations in the pattern must be 
known to understand intraplate volcanism and tectonism 
properly.  In addition, in regions of relative tectonic quies-
cence, knowledge of the in situ stress field is required for de-
lineation of potential seismic hazards associated with pre-
existing zones of weakness in the crust.
  This study represents an attempt to map the modern stress 
field (primarily Quaternary in the western United States and 
Tertiary and younger in the East) in the conterminous United 
States.  Principal stress orientations have been determined 
from geologic observations, earthquake focal mechanisms, 
and in situ stress measurements.  An attempt has also been 
made to categorize broad regions not only by the orientations 
of the principal stresses but also by their relative magnitudes, 
as inferred from currently active tectonism.
  Data are presented in terms of the orientation and relative 
magnitude of maximum and minimum horizontal stresses and 
a vertical stress.  We have assumed that one principal stress is 
vertical, and the horizontal components of the in situ stress 
field represent principal stresses.  Evidence supporting this as-
sumption includes observations of the nearly vertical attitude 
of dikes exposed over significant depth intervals at a given lo-
cality [R. B. Johnson, 1961] as well as the absence of exposed 
dikes that appear not to have been emplaced vertically (D. 
Pollard, oral communication, 1980).  In addition, measure-
ments of the complete stress tensor in deep mines [McGarr 
and Gay, 1978] and the near-horizontal orientations of the 
great majority of stress axes inferred from earthquake focal 
mechanisms also indicate that regionally the principal stresses 
are horizontal and vertical.
  The major contribution of the present study is the inclusion 
of new geologic data on the orientation of the stress field, 
largely in the western United States.  In addition, we have at-
tempted to go back to the original references and check the re-
liability of previously compiled data, particularly for focal 
mechanisms.  We have excluded poorly constrained points and 
have relied, whenever possible, on averages of a number of so-

heater approximating an ideal line source is placed 
along the longitudinal axis of a 5.1-cm-dia. by 
10.2-cm-long sample.  A thermocouple is attached and 
soldered to the heater at midsample.  The entire probe 
assembly is "potted" in place with a mixture of ceram-
ic cement and powdered copper to minimize and 
standardize contact resistance between probe and 
sample.  Disks of low-conductivity ceramic insulator 
are used to minimize heat loss from the ends of the 
sample.  Such heat losses, if unchecked, would lead to 
anomalously high apparent conductivities.  The over-
all internal heater length, 13.4 cm, gives a heater 
length-to-diameter (L/D) ratio of 36.  The L/D ratio 
within the sample itself is 32.  The sample-probe as-
sembly is separated from the confining fluid by a 
teflon sleeve.
       Power, in the form of carefully monitored and 
controlled voltage and current, is applied to the probe 
heater for periods of <2 min, while the exterior of the 
sample is maintained at constant pressure and nearly 
constant temperature (~T <1~C).  Because the exteri-
or temperature of the sample does not change signifi-
cantly during the period of the test, a sample of finite 
dimension behaves as if it were inifinite in volume.

ed from the internal heater temperature history and

MORPHOMETRIC STUDIES OF FRESH CINDER CONES

     Cinder cone dimensions have been studied systematically only in the last
8 years.  In this paper the terminology of Porter (1972) is used, with Wco = 
cone basal diameter; Wcr = crater diameter; Hco = cone height; s = cone slope 
angle (Fig. 2).  The depth of a crater can be readily modified during or after 
an eruption (at Paricutin the depth changed from 140 m to 30 m to 100 m 
over a 26-day period in late 1946; Wilcox, 1947) and often is less than the 
contour interval of maps used for measurement; therefore, the depth of the 
crater is not used as a descriptive parameter.  In order to relate cinder cone 
morphology to eruption conditions, I use only relatively fresh cones in the 
statistical comparisons.  Fresh cones are generally distinguished by a lack of 
vegetation and gullying on their flanks, have well-defined circular outlines, 
and frequently an abrupt change in slope occurs where the cone meets the 
surrounding ground surface.

Cone diameter distribution

     The distribution of basal diameters (Wco) for 910 cinder cones in the fol-
lowing areas: San Francisco volcanic field, Arizona; Mauna Kea, Hawaii;
Nunivak Island, Alaska; Kilimanjaro, Tanzania; Etna, Italy; and Paricutin,
Mexico is shown in Fig. 3, compiled from data supplied by Settle (1979, 
and personal communication).  Although both degraded and fresh cones are 
included in this sample, the results are considered reasonably representative 
of the diameter spectrum of terrestrial cinder cones.  Cinder cone diameters 
range from 0.25 km to about 2.5 km with a mean of about 0.9 km and a me-
dian of 0.8 km.  By contrast, the few spatter cones whose diameters are re-
ported in the literature are generally less than 0.1 km across at their bases.  
Maars are somewhat larger than cinder cones, with Wcr averaging 0.7-~0.8 km 
(Wood, in preparation), and composite (strato-) volcanoes are much larger, 
with basal diameters averaging 8 km (Wood, 1978).
     With a basal diameter of 0.13 km, the Reunion cone Cratere Ducrot is
smaller than all of the 910 cones in Fig. 3.  The small diameter is consistent 
with the interpretation that the Reunion cones are more like spatter cones 
than cinder cones.   The other three cones discussed in the previous section

                         FULL-WAVE ACOUSTIC LOG 

  The log on the left of Figure 1 illustrates one of the more recent geophysical
logs to be offered by the commercial logging companies. It is a full-wave 
acoustic log. The log shown is a Birdwell log which this company offers under 
the commercial name 3-D (Bird, 1965). In essence it is a recording of the 
sonic wave train for a period of time displayed as a variable intensity record-
ing. Whereas the sonic log shown in Figure 1 is essentially a recording of the 
time of first arrival of a sonic pulse through the rock at some fixed sender-to-
receiver distance (which is displayed as the time through the rock divided by 
the distance of travel or the reciprocal velocity), the 3-D log is a record of 
the wave train for some time after the first arrival. The dynamic elastic moduli
of the medium can be calculated from this log when used in conjunction with 
a density log. These moduli are Young's modulus, shear modulus, bulk mod-
ulus, and Poisson's ratio.
  The full-wave recording logs offer the first opportunity to obtain dynamic 
elastic moduli on a sufficiently small scale to allow comparisons to be made 
with core data. Such comparisons indicate that significant relationships exist 
among the acoustic properties of volcanic rocks.
CTURE ALONG 37TH PARALLEL
    Fluoride showed essentially no variation from March 
through June, and so analysis for fluoride was even-
tually discontinued.
  A few samples were also analyzed for cations using 
a Spectrospan III A DC argon plasma spectrophoto-
meter (table 21).  The values are tentative because a 
rigorous determination of cross interferences has not 
been completed.

                DISCUSSION  

  CHANGES IN SULFUR AND CHLORIDE     

  The S:Cl ratio increased steadily during the numer-
ous small ash eruptions from March 28 to May 18 
(fig. 146).  From May 18 on, only ash from the major 
eruptions (May 18, May 25, June 12, July 22, and 
August 7) was analyzed.  These later samples showed 
no consistent pattern.  This contrasts with data for 
Fuego Volcano, Guatemala, where S:Cl ratios cor-
relate with intensity of eruption (Rose, 1977).      
  Amounts of leachable SO4 and Cl on the ash varied 
greatly even for products of a single eruption, 
although sulfate concentrations remained approxi-
mately 2 times that of chloride, prior to May 18 (also 
noted by Rose (1977) for Fuego Volcano).  Variation 
of S:Cl was greater after May 18, as shown by the 
May 18 and June 12 samples.  Samples of the ash 
erupted on June 12, collected in Vancouver, Wash. 
(S:Cl = 0.13), are distinctly different from samples col-
lected on the flanks of Mount St. Helens (S:Cl = 1.18 
and 0.89).  The analytical procedures cannot account 
for the large spread in the data.  The variations are 
possibly due to changes in gas composition during 
eruption, meteorologic conditions, or variations in 
chemical and physical processes of the eruption.     
   Data presented by Rose (1977) and Noguchi and 
Kamiya (1963) showed a significant increase in S:Cl 
before a major eruption and a significant decrease 
after a major eruption (or series of eruptions).
Although a gradual increase occurred before the 
May 18 eruption, it was smaller than expected, prob-
ably because magma had already risen in the volcano 
and was emitting magmatic gases before the earliest 
sampled ash eruptions.  Likewise, no significant 
decrease has been seen in S:Cl between May 18 and

elsewhere suggest that more eruptions are possible

column collapse or expansion from the base of a ris-
ing column. At Mount St. Helens, the "classic-surge" 
environment was merely a transient waning phase 
trading the violent frontal part of the pyroclastic den-
sity flow.
   The pyroclastic density flow at Mount St. Helens 
was similar to classic surges in its relatively low den-
sity and its capacity to flow over ridges with only 
modest regard for topography. This event differs 
from classic surges in its size: the potential energy of 
the flow as it began its descent off the mountain was 
much greater than that of previously described 
surges, and accordingly the maximum grain size and 
other sedimentologic parameters of its deposits repre-
sent higher energy states than ever before observed 
for analogous processes.

250 km east of Mount St. Helens, to the western
border of Idaho and to some undetermined distance
beyond, the ash blanket consists of unit 1 and the
thicker unit 3. Farther downwind, in western Mon-
tana, only a single light-gray layer was deposited. The
basal unit may have pinched out or, more likely, the
two layers have merged owing to mixing downwind.
  The pronounced distal thickening of ash in the
vicinity of Ritzville, Wash. (figs. 336, 339), is caused
by the thickening of unit 3. Unit 1 also may have a 
distal thickness maximum between 400 and 500 km
downwind along the lobe axis. This distal thickening
of unit 1 may correlate with a high in bulk density
and mean-grain diameter (fig. 339) at about the same
distance.
  The dark ash (unit 1) began to fall considerably
before the light-colored ash (unit 3). At Spokane,
Wash., the advancing ash cloud became visible about
1400, ash started falling about 1543, and daylight was 
noticeably obscured about 1545 (Paul Weis, written
commun., 1980). Satellite photographs, however, in-
dicate that the ash front passed over Spokane about
2 hr before the cloud was visible to the ground
observer, except for a sun halo that appeared about
1215. This time difference suggests that the front of 
the ash cloud was diffuse. Similarly, dark ash fell at
Pullman, Wash., from about 1400 until about 1615,
when light-colored ash began to fall. The light-
colored ash continued to fall until about 0200 on May
19 (Hooper and others, 1980). On the north-south
traverse through Moscow, Idaho, the axis of the dark
layer is about 40 km south of the axis of the light-
colored layer (fig. 340); this difference suggests that
deposition for each layer occurred under somewhat
different wind conditions. At Missoula, Mont., ash
fall began about 2000-2030, some 3~~~ to 3~~~ hr after the
front passed, but near the north end of the traverse,
ash fall began between 2100 and 2200, about 3~~~ to 4~~~
hr after the front passed. Both in eastern Washington
and in western Montana, 2 hr or more elapsed bet-
ween the passage of the ash-cloud front and the start
of ash fall on the ground. The delay was greater on
the north side of the plume than on the south side.
  We compared the isochron map, which shows the
approximate shape and areal dimensions of the
airborne-ash plume, with the isomass map, which
shows the minimum areal and mass distribution of
the ash on the ground (fig. 341). The ash lobe on the
ground is offset to the north relative to the position of
the airborne plume. This northward shift of the air-
fall lobe relative to the position of the airborne plume
is a result of different wind directions with altitude.
Much of the ash deposited from central Washington
to western Montana was probably carried in the high-
velocity (60-125 km/hr) wind layer at altitudes of
about 10-13 km (fig. 335). This layer was transpor-
ting ash towards azimuths 093~-101~ (1020 PDT at
Spokane according to U.S. National Meteorological
Service). By 1600, these high-velocity winds had
shifted northeastward, toward azimuths 079~-087~
(fig. 335).  This shift in wind direction apparently is
the cause of the axis of the earlier, dark ash being off-
set to the south of the axis of the later, light-colored
ash (fig. 340).  During late morning and afternoon of
May 18, however, the slower low-level wind was
consistently more northeastward than was the high-
level wind. At Spokane, velocities of low-level winds
at altitudes 2,250-5,300 m were 30-60 km/hr. At
1020 they were toward azimuth 005~-070~, and at
1600 toward azimuth 048~-070~. These vectors
10~-90~ north of the high-level wind vectors explain
why the ash fell on the ground north of the observed
airborne-ash plume.

  Termination of Sierran plutonism and eastward displacement of
igneous activity into the Rocky Mountains near the end of the Cretaceous
may require a combination of increased Farallon-North American con-
vergence rate and accelerated absolute North American plate motion
toward the western trench. The trend of the western North American
plate margin relative to the absolute motion of the plate also may have
affected the subsequent igneous and tectonic history along the Cordillera.
Palinspastic restorations of western United States at the beginning of the
Cenozoic by Hamilton and Myers (1966), Hamilton (1969), and Arm-
strong and Suppe (1973) account for variable amounts of Late Cenozoic
extension in the Basin and Range province. The effect of these restora-
tions (fig. 9) is that the continental margin between the latitude of Las
Vegas and the California-Oregon border trends approximately north-
south. To the north, along Oregon and Washington, the continental
margin trends north by northeast. To the south, the trend of the con-
tinental margin is to the southeast, and the margin again changes to a
north by northwest direction along Mexico (Karig and Jensky, 1972).
  Eastward shift in loci of Early Cenozoic magmatic centers is gradual
along the British Columbia to Wyoming arc trend and is most pro-
nounced in the central Rocky Mountains of Colorado (fig. 3). The
Colorado locus is directly east of the north-south trending California
margin and is northeast of the southeast trending southern California
margin (fig. 9). From the subduction model, we would predict that the
  Further circumstantial evidence for the volcanic venting of granitic magma
chambers comes from interpretations of the large collapse calderas that form
around the feeder systems for many rhyolitic ash-flow or ignimbrite sheets
[Smith, 1960]. The calderas at the surface may be linked directly to cauldron-
subsidence structures beneath, hence some associated ring-dike complexes may
fill roughly concentric arrays of related fault fissures, and the rhyolitic ignim-
brite eruptions may signal partial evacuation of subjacent granitic magma cham-
bers having the dimensions of stocks and small batholiths. Hamilton [1969a, b]
notes that the Andean ignimbrites are typically more silicic than most major
batholiths, as would be expected if the upper levels of a differentiating magma
body were lost by eruption through vents in the roof. He infers that an elongate
granitic batholith belt of Cenozoic age probably lies unexposed at modest depths
beneath the curvilinear volcanic field of rhyolitic and andesitic extrusives along
the crest of the Andes. A Cretaceous analog may be present in Japan, where
granitic intrusives and rhyolitic extrusives of roughly the same ages are widely
exposed in the same broad region of western Honshu [Miyashiro, 1967, pp. 422-
423; Ichikawa et al., 1968].

ORIGINS OF ANDESITIC ROCKS

  Theories for the origin of andesitic magmas fall into three main categories:

1. Primary mantle melts or derivative melts formed by differentiation of
primary basaltic mantle melts
2. Primary crustal melts or derivative melts formed by crustal contamina-
tion of primary basaltic mantle melts
3. Melts, or their derivatives, formed from either the crustal or the mantle
parts of lithosphere descending along inclined seismic zones

  Either the first two or the last two could conceivably operate in conjunc-
tion, as rising magmas react with rocks at shallower levels and introduce heat
into shallower regions.

Derivation From Mantle Parents or Melts

  Presently permissible variants of the first type of theory are unacceptably
~iverse. Possible sequences of melting and crystallization within the mantle at
~ifferent pressure levels are complex, and varied alternate geochemical frac-
~ionation patterns of crystal residua or accumulates and liquid residua or dif-
~erentiates are conceivable [O'Hara, 1965]. The geochemical properties of a
~antle-derived lava that reaches the surface reflect conditions of temperature
~nd pressure at the highest level of equilibration between melt and some refrac-
~ory or accumulative crystalline residuum that remains at depth. Even if the
~rupted lava is primitive in the sense that it has not undergone contamination
~r differentiation at crustal levels, its composition does not necessarily resemble
~losely that of the liquid that formed at the site of initial fusion deep in the
~antle. To a first approximation, the changes that the magma undergoes during
ts rise through the mantle are masked from our direct view, as it were, by the
place at a relatively high strain rate and locally produced strong stratal rota-
tions and closely spaced normal faults, the faults themselves being rotated to 
relatively low dips. In those areas where extreme regional erosion, coupled 
with continuous isostatic rise, has been at play for 5 to 10 m.y. (as in the 
Sonoran Desert section), these structures (as noted above) are found to termi-
nate downward at large-scale, subhorizontal detachment surfaces or zones of 
extreme cataclasis and/or ductile shear, some of which developed prior to the 
onset of extension (Compton et al 1977, Coney 1979, Davis &Coney 1979, 
Davis et al 1979, Rehrig et al 1980). While the ductile flow of these rocks in 
some places clearly predated the initiation of extension, temperatures during 
the extensional episode were sufficiently high to reset radiometric clocks and, 
in other places, apparently remained high from the time of compression to the 
time of extension.

Role and Origin of Large-Scale Detachment Surfaces 

Initiation and maintenance of horizontal shear at the level of such detachments 
probably stemmed from increased shear stress, owing to reduction in lateral 
support in the shallow crust-~the result of thermal expansion, uplift (and the 
related increase in surface area that such uplift brings because of a local, 
incremental increase in earth radius), and lithospheric extension at depth. It 
was further served by a lowered shear strength, stemming from (a) the pres-
ence of zones of strong anisotrophy, inhomogeneity, and stress concentration 
that were created by earlier episodes of compressional thrusting and decol-
lement, as well as by mechanical layering, particularly the presence of ductile 
layers within, at the base of, and below the sedimentary pile that thins against
the massive buttress of the North American craton to the east; and (b) high 
pore pressure at the base of the brittle faulted column, its presence reflected 
in a compressional wave velocity inversion and elevated electrical conduc-
tivity (Eaton 1980).  At deeper levels, beneath the reheated mylonites or 
metamorphic rocks that underlie the normal faults (and across which a strong, 
shear stress gradient existed), extension is believed to have taken place by 
inhomogeneously distributed, uniform flow, the result of thermal pre-
weakening of the lithosphere by repeated magmatic invasion.  Known zones of 
inherited compressional decollement originated in pre-Tertiary time and early 
Tertiary time, but crustal temperatures high enough for extensional flow at 
natural strain rates, even at shallow lithospheric levels, apparently were main-
tained from the time of compression until at least mid-Cenozoic time when 
brittle extension, basaltic volcanism, regional uplift, and, locally, erosion and 
rapid cooling began.

Rheological Considerations 

The intracrustal boundary between a surface zone of elastic-brittle behavior 
and one of possible remobilized uniform flow by steady-state creep at depth,
equal to 29.53 inches of mercury. The average 
atmospheric pressure at sea level, 1 atmosphere
of pressure, is about 1013 millibars.
  When outdoors in the winter, one becomes
well aware of the chilling effects of wind. When
the temperature is at freezing (32~F), a 25 mile
per hour wind has a chilling effect equivalent to
zero temperature. When the temperature is zero,
a 10 mile per hour wind has a chilling effect
equivalent to -22~F, and a 25 mile per hour wind
has a chilling effect equivalent to -45~F. Wind
chill below -32~F causes freezing of exposed
human flesh, depending on one's circulation and
physical activity. With wind chill temperatures
much below that, survival efforts may be re-
quired. As long as the temperature is above 10~F,
only gales are dangerous. When the temperature
is zero, there is danger of flesh becoming frozen
if exposed to a 15 mile per hour wind. When the
temperature is -15~F a wind velocity of 10 miles
per hour can be dangerous. At temperatures 
much below that, it is probably best to remain
indoors by the fireside.
  Climatic differences between the Atlantic and 
Pacific coasts illustrate the effect of wind. Be-
cause of the prevailing westerly winds, the Pa-
cific Coast has a marine climate with cool sum-
mers and mild winters, while the Atlantic coast
has a continental climate with hot summers and 
cold winters. Hawaii and Puerto Rico are in trop-
ical latitudes, but are cooled by the northeast
trade winds.

Violent Weather and
Other Climatic Hazards

Every part of the continent is subject to occa-
sional combinations of conditions that produce
extreme weather. The result may be a record-
breaking hot or cold spell, a drenching downpour
and Pliocene time that cut off the headwaters of
the Little Colorado River (see p. 458).
  The faulting that outlined the mountain ranges
and basins apparently began in early or middle
Tertiary time, as it did in the Great Basin. There
was faulting before the deposition of the Santa
Fe and other late Tertiary formations along the
Rio Grande, but these formations were involved
in later movements along the faults (Fig. 16.10.A).
Some volcanism occurred about this time also.
The faulting here seems to have ceased earlier
than it did in the Salton Trough, Mojave Desert,
and Great Basin, as is suggested by the integra-
tion of the drainage and the scarcity of fresh fault
scarps. However, the belt of earthquake epi-
centers that extends northward along the Rio
Grande Valley (Fig. 2.17) suggests that earth 
movement is still going on.
  Along its northern boundary, the Mexican
Highland Section grades into the Colorado Pla-
teau, both structurally and topographically. In
New Mexico, the northern part of the Highland
is a block-faulted lava plateau that grades north-
ward into the lava-covered Datil Section of the
Colorado Plateau. The relationship is very simi-
lar to that along the northern edge of the Great
Basin, where block-faulted lavas grade north-
ward into the lava-capped plateaus there.
  In Arizona, the northern boundary of the
Highland is a dissected escarpment of Precam-
brian rocks capped by Paleozoic formations and
Tertiary lavas. The escarpment is several thou-
sand feet high, faces south, and extends 500 miles
from the Colorado River to the Rio Grande Val-
ley. The escarpment has acted as a structural
hinge along which the country lying to the south
has alternately been bent upward and downward
relative to the country to the north.  The country
south of the escarpment was structurally lower
than the country to the north during Early Creta-
ceous time. It was higher during late Cretaceous
times and again during early and middle Tertiary
time, when gravels were shed northward onto the
Colorado Plateau. Today it is lower (Fig. 16.11).

SACRAMENTO MOUNTAINS SECTION

  The Sacramento Mountains Section (Figs. 16.7,
16.12), which forms the eastern border of the
Basin and Range Province and adjoins the Great
miles long, respectively. Both trend about north-
west, and end near the Alaskan border. Their
width varies from about 1 to 10 miles. Where
narrow and straight, these are impressive struc-
tural features.
  North of the Yukon Basin is the Brooks Range,
which reaches altitudes of more than 8,000 feet
at its eastern extreme near the Mackenzie River
delta, and decreases to less than 5,000 feet alti-
tude in the west, where it marks the boundary
between a Mesozoic miogeosyncline on the north
and a geanticline on the south. The Mesozoic
formations thicken greatly northward from the
mountains to the coast. Uplift of these old rocks
formed the Brooks Range during Tertiary and 
Quaternary time. This uplift is separated from
that at the Seward Peninsula by the Quaternary
Selawik Basin.

SEWARD PENINSULA AND
BERING COAST UPLANDS

The Seward Peninsula and the Bering Coast
Uplands are part of an uplift that extends west-
ward into Siberia and is breached at the Bering
Strait. Uplift has been progressing for a long time;

  Both areas of eugeosynclinal rocks were visited
by us in the spring of 1966. A brief reconnaissance
of the Garlock Formation had been made previously
by Ketner, using Dibblee's (1952) map and litho-
logic data. The rocks in Pilot Knob Valley had been
noted during earlier reconnaissance mapping by
Smith (in Jennings, Burnett, and Troxel, 1962). A
striking similarity between the two statigraphic
sections was evident, and subsequent work was
aimed at testing the degree of similarity. Data on
the Garlock Formation presented here are chiefly
from the reports by Dibblee (1952, p. 15-19; 1967,
p. 27-28 and 34-35) and Christiansen (1961), sup-
plemented by results of the short inspection
described above and a few later visits for study of
specific rock units. Data on the metasedimentary
rocks in Pilot Knob Valley presented in this paper
were collected by Smith during 6 days' additional
geologic fieldwork and subsequent study of about 40
specimens in the laboratory.
  The metasedimentary rocks in Pilot Knob Valley
crop out 2 to 8 miles south of the Garlock fault as
isolated small hills, 150 to 400 feet high, that proj-
ect through the alluvium. Because the outcrops lie
within a U.S. Navy testing range, fieldwork was
minimal and had to be done on weekends, some-
times with a military escort. The work consisted of
delineating the extent of metasedimentary rocks
and traversing the best-exposed sections. On each
traverse, the planimetric width of each separable
lithologic unit was measured by pace, and the pace
distance and lithologic description of each recorded
on a portable tape recorder to be transcribed later.
The traverses totaled about 16,000 feet. The pace
distances were obviously approximate, and most
rock descriptions are based only on criteria that
could be applied in the field. The measured trav-
erses described in table 1 and shown on figure 3 are
not stratigraphic sections in the conventional sense.
Not enough time was available to make reliable geo-
logic maps of the areas composed of these rocks;
and the many faults and small-scale folds observed
along the traverse lines, though not shown on figure
2, plus the large areas of poor exposure, limit the
confidence one could have in stratigraphic sections
made without geologic maps. Furthermore, the
INTRODUCTION

This report-~Major Tar Sand and Heavy Oil
Deposits of the United States-~addresses four
important national energy resource objectives:
(1) to develop an updated assessment of U.S.
tar sand resources; (2) to independently appraise
the major tar sand deposits having 100 million
or more barrels in-place; (3) to document, using
previously published data, the minor tar sand
deposits, with between 10 and 100 million barrels
in-place; and, (4) to tabulate the nation's heavy
oil deposits.

BACKGROUND

The need for this report has grown with each
passing year since the last "official" tabulation
of U.S. tar sands, the 1965 Department of Inter-
ior/Bureau of Mines Monograph 12 entitled,
Surface and Shallow Oil-Impregnated Rocks of the
United States. That report was conducted under
the auspices of the Interstate Oil Compact Com-
mission as was this report.

Much has changed in the domestic energy
picture in the intervening twenty years since the
publishing of Monograph 12. All of these changes
have added importance to better understanding
and developing, (where economically feasible),
the large and valuable hydrocarbon resources
locked in U.S. tar sand deposits. It is the hope
of the staff, reviewers, and directors of this
study that this collection of information will
help industrial and public managers make more
judicious and timely decisions about the domestic
tar sand and heavy oil resources.

MAJOR FINDINGS

The four major findings of this study are:
1. The Total U.S. Tar Sand Resource is
Estimated at 54 Billion Barrels. The measured
U.S. tar sand resource in-place for major deposits
is estimated at 22 billion barrels. The speculative
resource in-place for major deposits is estimated
at 31 billion barrels. The minor deposits contain
1.0 billion barrels of speculative tar sand resource
in-place. Not addressed by this study is the
offshore California area where tar sand/heavy
oil deposits are presumed to exist, but for which
data are not yet obtainable.

The tar sand resource estimate for the U.S. is
shown by state on Figure 1 (see page 2) and on
the following table. The distribution of tar sand
by state and resource category is shown on
Figure 2 (see page 3).
tar sand resource is 11.9 billion barrels,
and the speculative resource is 8.2 billion
barrels.

~ The tar sand resource estimate for California
is 4.7 billion barrels; expansions in the
size of previously identified deposits, the
identification of new deposits, and the
attractive properties of the tar sand reservoirs
should make California an important center
for tar sand development.

~ The tar sand resource in Texas is estimated
at 4.8 billion barrels due to the recognition
and improved definition of three large
deposits-~the San Miguel D, the Anacacho
and the Hensel formations.

~ The Kentucky tar sand resource in-place
is estimated at 1.7 billion barrels measured,
plus an additional 1.7 billion barrels spe-
culative, up from the previous estimate of
less than 50 million barrels.

~ Alabama is estimated to have 6.5 billion
barrels of tar sand in-place, mainly in one
large deposit, the Hartselle sandstone of
northern Alabama.

~ A major new tar sand/heavy oil area, con-
taining about 10 billion barrels of speculative
resource in-place, has been identified on
the North Slope of Alaska, overlying the
Kuparuk River oil field.

4. Over 1,100 Heavy Oil Deposits Have
Been Identified and Tabulated; They Constitute
an Important, Only Partly Developed National
Resource. Reservoir properties and production
histories were identified (from publicly available
data) for 1,100 heavy oil fields and reservoirs in
the U.S. (Heavy oil fields are defined as deposits
having an oil gravity between 10~API and 20~API).
The majority of the heavy oil reservoirs and
fields are in California, with 356 deposits, Texas,
with 350 deposits, and Arkansas, with 120
deposits.

Heavy oil deposits constitute an important
and challenging U.S. resource target that require

per year, and evaporation from the reservoir is
estimated at 70 in. (1,780 mm) per year (F. P. Kipple,
written commun., 1975).
  When the study began (October 1962) nearly 70
percent of the vegetation on the flood plain was
saltcedar (Tamarix chinensis)1, with the remaining
vegetation consisting of mesquite (Prosopis), willow
(Salix), cottonwood (Populus), seepwillow (Baccharis),
and seepweed (Suaeda). Vegetation was removed from
the flood plain in segments of several acres at different
periods during 1967-71. Virtually all the study area
was cleared of vegetation by March 1971.

Twelve components are significant in defining ET

  In most places the gypsum in the nodules is massive
and earthy, but locally they consist of aggregates of
diamond-shaped crystals or fibers (fig. 22). At any
given locality the crystal form of the gypsum appears
to be uniform, but the forms differ from one locality to
another. These crystal forms may be an ephemeral 
feature subject to seasonal change and may reflect the
presence of impurities or seasonal differences in physical
environment, such as degree and rate of recent wetting
or drying. The hemihydrate, bassanite although com-
mon in the chloride layer at the surface, was not
observed in this buried layer of nodules where there is
little sodium chloride.
  The nodules contain traces of borates and nitrates;
no nitrates were detected in the salt crust.
  Below the sulfate layer is the carbonate layer of silty
sand, containing tiny delicate crystals of acutely ter-
minated calcite as illustrated on figure 23. This
calcite is abundant, but comprises only a fraction of a
percent of the deposit. The high proportion of calcium
and carbonate in the deposit (see for example, S136a,
table 31) is due chiefly to the clastic limestone and
dolomite. The acutely terminated calcite is the char-
acteristic mineral of the carbonate zone, but by no
means is it the dominant one. It is in fact a minor one.
Its deposition possibly is facilitated by the organic

source of petroleum hydrocarbons, a possibility
that has been demonstrated by laboratory experi-
ments. As slow as the process of conversion of
organic material to hydrocarbons is, 14C studies in-
dicate that the process can occur in less than 10,000
years.
  The higher forms of life that grow and live on the
land are unimportant, but the lower planktonic or-
ganisms, such as diatoms and algae, that thrive
abundantly near the surface of the sea, are now
considered the most probable and important source
materials. Some geologists think that the differ-
ences in oils may be due to differences in source
material, but this seems quite unimportant, since
the complicated processes that follow could yield
vastly greater differences.
  The organic remains accumulate in the bottom
muds of lagoons or in depressions on the floor of
shallow seas and there become incorporated in ac-
cumulating sediments. Trask has tested thousands
of bottom mud samples and has found the organic
content to be fairly constant for about 160 kilome-
ters offshore and to range from 0.3 percent in deep
sea oozes to 7 percent off the coast of California.

26 eastern states referred to indicated the sur-
ficial occurrence of approximately 67 mapped,
named, and formally accepted stratigraphic
units that might have an economic potential in
this industry. Lithologically, these break down
into quartz-mica schists, quartzites, sandstones
(variable in degree of consolidation), quartz 
conglomerates, quartz gravels, and several
widely separated tripoli districts. Also included
were many geologically undesignated dune sand
occurrences, terrace sands and gravels, com-
mercial chert deposits, massive quartz pegma-
tites, hydrothermal replacement bodies and
silicified zones, some of which have been and
probably are viable from an economic point
of view.
  In this connection there are many scattered,
very pure, silica sand deposits of Holocene age
along the coastal plains of South Carolina,
Georgia, and Florida, some of which have been
and are being reworked by wind and the present
river systems. Another interesting and valuable
source type may be referred to as the St.
Lucie soil zone which is well-developed along
a stretch of east Florida coast particularly
in St. Lucie county (Hudson, 1946), the type
locality, as well as inland in this state and in
south Georgia (Teas, 1921). The key to the
purity of these deposits relates to a fluctuating
ground water table and an excess of azohumic
and other organic acids resulting from decaying
swamp vegetation which leaches the iron nor-
mally present in the surficial sand. This organic
chemistry develops the so-called Van Dyke or
sap-brown ore at the base of the leached zone
which was much sought after as an organic dye 
for paint, wood stains, and inks before the ad-
vent of aniline dyes. Most of these types of
deposits are from 4 to possibly 12 ft thick on
flat terrain with consequent disappointingly low
tonnages. However, they are commercially
viable at a few points in each of the states men-
tioned and can supply local flint glass sand
markets for indeterminant periods of time if
extensive enough, which several have proved to
be. The inevitable silica sand rings which par-
tially surround the puzzling "Carolina Bays,"
are believed to be a manifestation of this leach-
ing and in one instance were commercially ex-
ploited for several years in Williamsburg
County, South Carolina (Buie, 1958).
  Two formational units for high grade ceramic
products exposed in the eastern and a few
middle western states warrant detailed citation
as the most successfully exploited silica raw
material sources on the basis of tonnage and
profit in this country. They are the St. Peter
sandstone together with its stratigraphic equiva
lents of Lower Ordovician age, and the Ori~
kany sandstone or orthoquartzite of Lower
Devonian age. The St. Peter is exposed and 
exploited principally in northern Illinois and,
to a lesser degree, in southern Wisconsin and
Missouri. Sandstones of the same time equiva-
lency also are exploited in Arkansas and Okla-
homa (Lamar, 1927; Ham, 1945). These for-
mations are relatively flat-lying and massively
bedded materials of weak to moderate consoli-
dation that lend themselves equally well to 
open pit or underground mining recovery, both
methods being currently employed. Physical
recovery is high and a minimum of plant
preparation is necessary because of its extreme
natural purity. Reserves are large and nearly
completely controlled by current producers.
Even deeply covered areas, now unused be-
cause of excessive stripping costs or otherwise
marginal because of local factors, have been
explored and acquired by operating companies
for possible future use. What little St. Peter
sandstone that remains under private owner-
ship will soon be, if it has not already been,
completely zoned out of the market by urbani-
zation pressures.
  The Oriskany quartzite, more precisely the
Ridgeley sandstone (Harris, 1972), is a ridge
maker, to a large degree, because of its greater
induration and consequent structural attitudes.
For the most part it is found in strongly 
dipping beds ranging from 45~ to the vertical
and even overturned. In a few areas it is as
flat-bedded as the St. Peter, whereas, locally, it
may be preserved intact in homoclinal, anti-
clinal, and synclinal postures (Bates, 1960).
Being an integral part of the Appalachian High-
lands, its economic occurrences are pretty well
limited to the tri-state area of Virginia, West
Virginia, and Pennsylvania. The texture, purity,
and degree of induration are all subject to ex-
treme variability which is much less seldom
encountered with the St. Peter. However, by
and large, it shares the same perfection of grain
that the St. Peter enjoys and most of the defects
are secondarily induced and can be mitigated
and often nearly eliminated by suitable plant
beneficiation. Here again, all known reserves 
in the technical sense and much that could be
classed as potential resource acreage is believed
to be owned by, or under long-term lease to
local operating companies. A substantial por-
tion of what is already controlled will doubtless
never be completely exploited because of the 
ever-increasing zonal restrictions due to urbani-
zation.

quartz veins, ranging from 25 to 100 feet in length and 6 inches to 8 feet
in thickness, lie en echelon along the altered area; they strike N.
60~-70~ E., transverse to the altered zone. Fluorite is erratically dis-
tributed in the veins, and the content ranges from a trace to as much as
50 percent of the vein material. In some veins the fluorite forms a distinct
crustiform center surrounded by vein quartz; in others, the fluorite is
intergrown with quartz, chalcedony, albite( ?), and calcite.

SUGGESTIONS FOR EXPLORATION OF FLUORITE DEPOSITS

  The best commercial fluorite deposits are more likely to occur in a lime-
stone host than in a volcanic one.
  The deposits in altered volcanic rocks probably are too low in grade
to support large-scale mining under 1969 prices, and veins rich enough
to warrant selective mining are small. However, richer replacement
bodies in Paleozoic limestone may have formed beneath the volcanic
cover approximately coincident with the extensive altered zones of areas
5 through 8 and along the northwest alinement of the zones. This depth
may approximate 1,000 feet in areas 5 and 6.
  Deposits in limestone contain the best grade ore, locally 90 percent
CaF2 by weight. In some of the deposits, fluorite completely replaces
limestone, but it rarely if ever replaces silicified fragments of limestone,
quartzite, or rhyolite. Hence the grade of ore in the silicified breccias
will never be as good as that possible in the limestone; also, a penalty is
incurred for silica in fluorspar ore. However, because most of the fluorite
in the brecciated jasperized limestone coats and cements breccia frag-
ments, the bulk of the fluorite can be recovered by crushing to half-inch
grain size and screening out the undersize, which contains the fluorite.
Standard flotation methods can be used to separate fluorite and silica
to produce acid-grade (97 percent CaF2) fluorspar, and since metal-
lurgical grade spar need only have an effective CaF2 content of 60 per-
cent, the deposits in silicified breccias should not be neglected. To
separate calcite from fluorite by flotation requires expensive heating of
the flotation feed, and the cost of this, in particular, somewhat offsets
the higher grade of the known replacement deposits in limestone.
  The possible importance of the deposits in limestone is supported by
the striking resemblance of the Hi-Grade and Mammoth deposits to very
rich, important pipelike deposits seen by Sainsbury in the Rio Verde in
Mexico; at both places fluorite forms fine-grained, colloformly banded,
vuggy ore in limestone near the contact between limestone and volcanic
rocks. The drab color and fine grain of the fluorite make visual recogni-
tion of the fluorite difficult; confidence in recognition of deposits during
prospecting is gained only after considerable familiarity with known
deposits.
in ways that numerical methods cannot yet accom-
plish.
  Lacking direct information from drilling, favorable
ground is defined largely by comparing available geo-
logic, geochemical, and geophysical data with those
from known and developed ore deposits. The primary
objective is to identify geologic environments favor-
able for the occurrence of mineral resources in the
area being assessed. Ore deposit models, especially
those including interpretation of the ore-forming pro-
cesses, embodying these favorable geologic environ-
ments can be powerful tools in evaluating the resource
potential of an area. Do the observed characteristics
of the area being evaluated match the descriptive
model of an ore deposit type? Did the right sequence
of processes take place that could form ore deposits?
Genetic models are needed to flesh out incomplete
descriptive frameworks; moreover, consideration of
processes that form ore is inherent in those circum-
stances where prediction of resource potential is re-
quired. If the basic conditions of an ore deposit model
are met, other factors such as composition of host rock
or availability of structure can be used to determine
degrees of potential more closely and to focus atten-
tion ~n specific areas. In any area a large number of
ore deposit models must be considered, some to be
examined closely if geologic factors are favorable,
some to be rejected if they are unfavorable.

Definitions

  A high mineral resource potential is deemed to exist
where geologic, geochemical, and geophysical char-
acteristics favorable for resource accumulation are
known to be present, or where enough of these char-
acteristics are present to give strong support to genetic
models favorable for resource accumulation and 
where evidence shows that mineral concentration-~
mineralization in the broad sense-~has taken place.
This category includes not only known mining dis-
tricts but also other areas where data are adequate
to demonstrate or indicate an excellent possibility that
mineralized rock exists. Where available, data on the 
size, grade, and location of individual deposits are
important in making this assessment, but the avail-
ability of these data is not a primary requisite. Areas
with high mineral resource potential are more closely
judged with respect to current economic conditions
than those with lesser resource potential.
  Moderate mineral resource potential exists where 
geologic, geochemical, and geophysical characteris-
tics favorable for resource accumulation are known
or can reasonably be interpreted to be present but 
where evidence for mineralization is less clear cut or
has not yet been found. A reasonable possibility for
the discovery of valuable mineral deposits should exist 
in all areas rated as having moderate mineral resource
potential. Genetic models are especially valuable in
those areas with moderate potential where extrapo-
lation of subtle data may be required. Those areas
classified as having moderate potential on the basis
of sparse information could have this rating changed 
to high by new and favorable information or by
changes in demand for a commodity or in economic
conditions.
  Low mineral resource potential is assigned to areas
where geologic, geochemical, and geophysical char-
acteristics are unfavorable, where evidence indicates
that mineral concentrations are unlikely, or where
requirements of genetic models cannot be supported,
such as a lack of source or mechanism of accumu-
lation. This broad category embraces areas with ob-
vious but dispersed and apparently uneconomical
mineral occurrences, as well as areas with few indi-
cations of mineralization. Use of the low potential
category requires an element of positive knowledge;
it should not be a catchall for areas lacking adequate
data.
  A category of unknown mineral resource potential
is necessary where the level of knowledge, at the ap-
propriate scale, is so inadequate that to classify a unit
area as high, moderate, or low in mineral resource
potential would be misleading. The size of the unit
area under consideration and the detail of informa-
tion available are key elements in deciding where this
category is best applied. Preliminary assessments of
areas requiring further study would particularly ben-
efit from such a category.
  Almost all areas of the earth's crust contain mineral
commodities of at least some possible economic value
were they adequately explored and should a market
develop. It is thus deemed inadvisable to class any
area as having no mineral resource potential, although
some areas may be classed as having no potential for
a particular mineral commodity.

Discussion

  Mineral resources form in all types of geologic en-
vironments, and occurrences vary widely even within
a single general type of deposit. For completeness,
statements describing high or moderate resource po-
tential should specify commodity and mode of oc-
currence; data and logic used to reach the conclusion
should be made clear in supporting documentation.
  The magnitude (tonnage, grade, value) of possible
mineral occurrences must be considered in assigning
areas to high, moderate, and low resource potential
categories; an important distinction exists between
possible large or clustered deposits, as compared with
small and isolated deposits. For example, hydrother-
mal metal concentrations range from small isolated
deposits, to clusters of small deposits, to large deposits
surrounded by halos of smaller deposits, to isolated

significant amounts of uranium.  The Cottonwood zone is 
associated with a uranium deposit reported to contain 13 
million tons of 0.5 to 0.6 percent uranium.
     Alteration minerals characterizing the sedimentary 
section exposed along Cottonwood Creek, at the extreme 
west end of the uranium ore deposit, are shown in Figure 
13.  Clinoptilolite and erionite occur sporadically through 
the stratigraphic section and are more abundant in beds 
of tuffaceous sandstones.  Feldspar occurs throughout the 
section. 
     Uranium occurs at several stratigraphic intervals in 
the Cottonwood section.  Uranium in the basal 66 ft (20 m) 
of section occurs in the opaline silica-rich, thinly-laminated, 
ferric hydroxide stained layers.  The uranium is closely 
associated with mercury, lithium, arsenic and antimony, 
strongly reflecting a common presence in the altering 
hydrothermal solutions.  This is strikingly shown by the 
uranium and arsenic-rich calcite layer at approximately 
150 ft (46 m).  The variability of the elemental contents 
in the lower 66 ft (20 m) is obscured by a composite 
sampling in the 13 to 46 ft (4 to 14 m), i.e. individual 
layers and beds were sampled only in the lower and upper 
parts of the interval.  Above 66 ft (20 m) the elements 
begin to separate.  Lithium is less than 50 ppm in the 
calcite layer at 150 ft (46 m) and it is inversely related to 
the uranium, arsenic, and mercury content.  Carbonaceous 
debris is plentiful in the 92 to 121 ft (28 to 37 m) interval.  
Both lithium but particularly uranium are enriched in the 
121 to 138 ft (37 to 42 m) interval of organic-rich (ostracods
and carbonaceous debris) lacustrine mudstones that alter-
nate with black opaline-silica layers.  A very coarse-textured 
tuff grades upward into a finer air-fall tuff.  The tuff is little 
altered, contains the highest thorium content in the se-
quence, and is low in uranium, lithium, arsenic, and 
mercury.  The lacustrine sequence resumes at about 154 ft 
(47 m) with an enrichment in lithium, uranium, and arsenic 
in an organic-rich claystone.  This sequence is interrupted 
at about 150 ft (50 m) by a gray air-fall tuff indicated in 
the sequence by the thin bed enriched in thorium.  Above 
this bed, lacustrine claystones are enriched in lithium, 
arsenic, and mercury.  This is the thickest interval of lithium 
enrichment in the section.  Above the claystones, at about 
200 ft (61 m), the section becomes a very coarse textured 
tuffaceous sandstone partially covered by slumping.
     In the Opalite hydrothermal alteration zone a large 
area of potassium feldspar extends outward for 0.5 mi 
(0.75 km) from the deposit.  Peripheral to the potassium-
feldspar zone is a zeolite zone consisting of clinoptilolite, 
erionite, and potassium feldspar.  Around the Opalite mine 
anomalously high uranium values are restricted to the 
zone of potassium-feldspar alteration.  Local areas within 
the Opalite mercury mine contain up to 265 ppm uranium.

 lands were tectonically much more active than the Canadian
 Shield, and were subsequently lost by foundering into the oceans.

 edges of the continental shelves and it would be difficult to found-

deviation between the two quantities becomes progressively greater till at
c = 2 the point of inflection is coincident with the origin of the isotherm.
  When c falls between 1 and 2, the point of inflection actually occurs at a
negative value of P, and so no longer corresponds to a point on the experi-
mental isotherm: the isotherm is then no longer of Type II but has become a 
clear Type III. If c lies between 0 and 1, the value of P at the point of 
inflection is imaginary; again, the isotherm is of Type III.

2.4 Application of the BET Equation to Type II Isotherms

The form of the BET equation most often applied to experimental data is 
that given in (2.37), viz.
  A few representative BET plots of Type II isotherms are given in Figs.
2.6-2.9. Those in Fig. 2.6 for nitrogen adsorption at -193~C on various
catalysts, taken from the original paper of Brunauer, Emmett and Teller(2),
are linear between relative pressures of about 0~05 and 0~35. On extra-
polation they pass close to the origin (a feature which is typical of nitro-
gen adsorption on oxides and hydrated oxides) and this indicates a
relatively large value of c, which is associated with the presence of a distinct
knee in the adsorption isotherm (p. 57). The isotherms and BET plots in
Fig. 2.7, obtained by Davis, DeWitt and Emmett(16), illustrate a case
where c is small (e.g. for n-C4H10, c = 5~4 at 0~ and c = 11~6 at -78~C).
The isotherm is much more rounded at the low pressure end and corre-
spondingly the intercept on the p/x(p0-p)-axis is further away from the
origin; the range of linearity is roughly the same as before, however.
  Contrary to what had at one time been supposed, the range of validity of
the BET equation does not always extend to relative pressures as high as
0~30 or 0~35. In Fig. 2.8 and 2.9 there are examples of BET plots which
begin to depart from linearity when the relative pressure exceeds 0~1. The
plots of Fig. 2.8 are taken from the recent work of Isirikyan and Kiselev(17)
on graphitized carbon black. The range of relative pressures over
which the BET plots were linear was 0~0003 to 0~09 for N2 at -195~; 0~04

  The ~D of fluid inclusions of late Plio-
cene age (laminae 10B-5 through 10B-7 
and 10A-5 through 10A-8) average about 
-60 per mil, or about 40 per mil heavier 
than that of modern recharge (-99 per 
mil) and late (?) Wisconsin age (5) 
ground water (-102 per mil) discharging 
today from the major artesian springs in 
the region (Fig. 2).   More significantly, 
the ~D values, in general, become pro-
gressively lighter with decreasing age 
over the last 1 to 2 million years.   Do 
these values represent deuterium of Plio-
cene and Pleistocene ground water 
trapped in the veins during the calcite 
precipitation, or are they artifacts of (i) 
water-mineral exchange, (ii) remobiliza-
tion of fluid inclusions during calcite 
recrystallization, or (iii) selective diffu-
sion of 1H2O from the fluid inclusions?   
We cannot attribute the changes in deu-
terium to water-mineral exchange be-
cause the water-bearing fractures in the 
regional carbonate aquifer, feeding the 
modern (and fossil) flow system, are 
typically coated with calcite or dolomite 
(8).  This coating precludes the exchange 
of hydrogen between water and clay 
minerals during flow from recharge to 
discharge areas.   In fact, the difference in  
therefore, air tends to occupy the larger pores. The two fluids-~water and
air-~coexist in the soil by occupying different portions of the pore space 
having different geometric configurations. For this reason, the soil exhibits 
toward the two fluids different conductivity or permeability functions, as
these relate to the different effective diameters and tortuosities of the pore
sets occupied by each fluid. Only when the soil is completely permeated by
one or the other, be it water or air, should either flowing fluid encounter the
same transmission coefficient of the medium. (See the discussion of intrinsic
permeability in Chapter 8.)
  Notwithstanding the differences between water flow and air flow, it is
possible to formulate the convective flow of air in the soil as an equation
analogous to Darcy's law for water flow, as follows:
where Qt and Q~ are the amounts of exchange at time t and equilibrium
(~) respectively; Q0 = concentration of tracer ion initially present, and
S, V, and r represent the surface area, volume, and radius of the exchang-
er particles. The biggest practical problem in determining the diffusion
coefficient is the measurement of the surface area. One method involv-
ing gas adsorption and another involving a projection method have been
used to determine S (60). A better method would be one which is in-
dependent of the surface area. The effective or apparent diffusion co-
efficient, Di, is related to interdiffusion of the two exchanging cations,
or interchange of cation A and B with the same valence, D~~ =D~~ =Di,
and is independent of the composition. The apparent diffusion coeffi-
cient varies with temperature according to the Arrhenius equation. For
zeolites, Di varies from 1 x 10-8 to 1 x 10-13 cm2 sec-1. Detailed studies
of ion exchange kinetics and diffusion have been made on chabazite
(60, 61) and mordenite (62, 63) using radiochemical methods to follow
the ion exchange process. In chabazite, the narrowest apertures, about
3.9 A in diameter (Chap. 2), are large enough to permit diffusion of
most ions without squeezing. It is probable that replacement of some
of the ions found within the hexagonal prism would involve cation dif-
fusion through the 6-rings. The self-diffusion coefficients of certain ions
in chabazite follow the Arrhenius equation (see Table 7.16). The energy
barriers associated with the self-diffusion process vary from about 7
kcal for the univalent ions to about double that value for calcium and
strontium ions. However, the energy barrier was 8.7 kcal for barium
ion, the largest of the divalent ions.
  The Arrhenius equation is used to determine the activation energy, E:

believes that there are also important
advantages in providing for individual
protection in ways compatible with the
containment and assurance
requirements. In discussing this issue,
the SAB Subcommittee stated that: "We
support the use of a population risk
criteria. We believe it is impractical to
provide absolute protection to every
individual for all postulated events or
for very long periods. On the other hand,
in our view it is important that, for the
first several hundred years, residents of
the region immediately outside the
accessible environment have very great
assurance that they will suffer no, or
negligible, ill effects from the
repository."
  The individual protection
requirements in the final rule limit the
annual exposure from the disposal
system to a member of the public in the
accessible environment, for the first
1,000 years after disposal, to no more
than 25 millirems to the whole body or
75 millirems to any organs. These
limitations apply to the predicted
behavior of the disposal system,
including consideration of the
uncertainties in predicted behavior,
assuming that the disposal system is not
disrupted by human intrusion or the
occurrence of unlikely natural events.
The Agency chose the limits of 25
millirem/year to the whole body and 75
millirem/year to any organ because it
believes that they represent a
sufficiently stringent level of protection
for situations where no more than a few
individuals are likely to receive this
exposure.  If such an individual were
exposed to this level over a lifetime
(which seems particularly unlikely given
the localized pathways through which
waste might escape from a geologic
repository). the Agency estimates this
would cause a 5~10-4 chance of
incurring a premature fatal cancer.
  In choosing a time period for these
requirements to protect individuals
nearby disposal systems, the Agency
took into account concerns such as
those expressed by the SAB by
examining the effects of choosing
different time frames. As 10,000 years
was chosen for the containment
requirements because it is long enough
to encourage use of disposal sites with
natural characteristics that enhance
long-term isolation, 1,000 years was
chosen for the individual protection
provisions because the Agency's
assessments indicate it is long enough to
insure that particularly good engineered
barriers would need to be used at
potential sites where some ground water
would be expected to flow through a
mined geologic repository. Use of a time
much shorter than 1,000 years would not
call for substantial engineered barriers
even at disposal sites with a lot of
ground water flow.
  On the other hand, demonstrating
compliance with individual exposure
limits for times much longer than 1,000
years appears to be quite difficult
because of the analytical uncertainties
involved. It would require predicting
radionuclide concentrations-~even from
releases of tiny portions of the waste-~
in all the possible ground water
pathways flowing in all directions from
the disposal system, at all depths down
to 2,500 feet, as a function of time over
many thousands of years. At some of the
sites being considered (and possibly all
of them, depending upon what is
discovered during site characterization)
the only certain way to comply with
such requirements for periods on the
order of 10,000 years appears to be to
use very expensive engineered barriers
that would rule out any potential
releases over most of this period. While
such barriers could provide longer-term
protection for individuals, they would
not provide substantial benefits to
populations because the containment
and assurance requirements already
reduce population risks to very small
levels.
  Based on all of these considerations,
the Agency has decided that a 1,000-
year duration is adequate for
quantitative limits on individual
exposures after disposal. For longer time
periods, several of the qualitative
assurance requirements should help to
reduce the chances that individuals will
receive serious radiation exposures. In
addition, 40 CFR Part 191 in no way
limits the future applicability of the
Agency's drinking water standards (40
CFR Part 141)-~which protect
community water supply systems
through institutional controls-~or of
similar standards that future generations
may choose to adopt.
  In assessing the performance of a
disposal system with regard to
individual exposures, all pathways of
radioactive material or radiation from
the disposal system to people shall be
considered. In particular, the
assessments must assume that
individuals consume all of their drinking
water (2 liters per day) from any portion
of a "significant source of ground water"
anywhere outside of the "controlled
area" surrounding the disposal system.
Significant sources of ground water are
defined to include underground
formations that are likely to be able to
provide enough water for a community
water system as defined in 40 CFR Part
141. (More information regarding this
wastes are generated and when the
projected health effects manifest
themselves made it difficult to
determine what level of residual risk
should be allowed by these disposal
standards. The difficulty arose because
most of the benefits derived in the
process of waste production fall upon
the current generation, while most of the
risks fall upon future generations. Thus,
a potential problem of intergenerational
equity with respect to the distribution of
risks and benefits became apparent.
This problem is sometimes referred to as
the intergenerational risk issue, and it is
not unique to the disposal of high-level
radioactive wastes. If the Agency tried
to insure that these standards fully
satisfied a criterion of intergenerational
equity with respect to the distribution of
risks and benefits, it might appear that
no risk should be passed on to future
generations. This is a condition which
the Agency believes cannot be met by
disposal technologies foreseeable within
this century. However, there is one
particular factor which has reinforced
EPA's decision about the
reasonableness of the risks permitted
under the disposal standards. This is the
following evaluation of the risks
associated with undisturbed uranium
ore bodies. Additionally, for the purpose
of comparing the risks permitted under
the standards to other radiation risks
which people are currently exposed to, a
brief discussion of the risks from other
natural sources of radiation is also
included.
  Uranium Ore: Most uranium ore in the
United States occurs in permeable
geologic strata containing flowing
ground water. Radionuclides in the ore,
particularly uranium and radium,
continuously enter this ground water.
EPA estimated the potential risks from
these undisturbed ore bodies using the
same generalized environmental models
that were used for releases from a waste
repository.  The effects associated with
the amount of ore needed to produce the
high-level wastes that would fill the
model geologic repository can vary
considerably.  Part of this variation
corresponds to actual differences from
one ore body to another; part can be
attributed to uncertainties in the
assessment. After revising the
population risk models in accordance
with the recommendations of the SAB
Subcommittee, these estimates of the
risks from unmined ore bodies ranged
from about 10 to more than 100,000
excess cancer deaths over 10,000 years.
Thus, leaving the ore unmined appears
to present a risk to future generations
comparable to the risks from disposal of
wastes covered by these standards.
  Variations in Natural Background:
Radionuclides occur naturally in the
earth in very large amounts, and are
produced in the atmosphere by cosmic
radiation. Everyone is exposed to
natural background radiation from these
natural radionuclides and from direct
exposure to cosmic radiation. Individual
exposures average about 100 millirems
per year, with a range of about 60 to 200
millirem/year. These natural
background radiation levels have
remained relatively constant for a very
long time. According to the same linear,
nonthreshold dose effect relationship
used in EPA's other analyses, an
increase of one millirem per year (about
one percent) in natural background in
the United States would result in about
60 additional deaths per year, or 600,000
over a 10,000-year period.
  Natural Radionuclide Concentrations
in Ground Water: One source of this
exposure to natural background
radiation comes from naturally
occurring radionuclides found in ground
water. Radium is the most important of
the naturally occurring radioactive
materials likely to occur in public water
supply systems, but uranium is also
found in ground waters due to its
natural occurrence. Surveys of
radionuclides in ground water systems
indicate: a United States range of 0.1 to
50 picocuries (pCi) per liter for radium-
226 (with isolated sources exceeding 100
pCi/liter); up to 74 pCi/liter for all
alpha-emitting radionuclides other than
uranium (although most of the alpha-
emitting concentrations are below 3
pCi/liter); and up to 650 pCi/liter for
total uranium concentrations. Elevated
radium-226 concentrations are found
along the Atlantic coastal region and the
Midwest; low levels are usually found in
the treated water supplies in the
western States. Elevated uranium and
alpha-emitting radionuclide
concentrations are generally limited to
the Rocky Mountain region and Maine
and Pennsylvania in the east.
  The Agency's primary drinking water
regulations (40 CFR Part 141) limit the
contamination levels for radium-226 and
radium-228 to 5 pCi/liter and the levels
for total alpha-emitting contamination
(excluding radon and uranium) to 15
pCi/liter. Elevated concentrations of
radium in drinking water are generally a
problem associated with smaller
community water systems, with an
estimated 500 systems exceeding 5 pCi/
liter. The Agency's risk assessments
indicate that continuous consumption of
water containing the maximum amount
of radium allowed may cause between
0.7 and 3 cancers per year per million
exposed persons.
Environmental Impacts

  A Draft Environmental Impact
Statement (EIS) was prepared for the
proposed rule, in accordance with the
Agency's procedures for the voluntary
preparation of EIS's (30 FR 37419).
However, section 121(c) of the NWPA
subsequently exempted this action from
preparation of an EIS under section
102(2)(C) of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and from any
environmental review under
subparagraph (E) or (F) of section 102(2)
of the NEPA. Accordingly, a Final EIS
has not been prepared for promulgation
of this rule. The potential health impacts
of this action are summarized above,
and much of the information that would
have been contained in a Final EIS is
documented in the Background
Information Document that accompanies
this final version of 40 CFR Part 191.

Regulatory Impacts

  This rule was submitted to the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) for
review as required by Executive Order
12291. The final rule has not been
classified as a "major rule" in
accordance with the guidelines provided
by the Executive Order. Any comments
received from OMB and EPA's
responses to those comments are
available for public inspection in the
docket cited above under the heading
"ADDRESSES."
  The Agency has had to take an
unusual approach in considering the
regulatory impacts of this proposed
action-~as required by Executive Order
12291. In most cases, a regulation
concerns an ongoing activity and may
be considered a burden whose costs
should be judged against the regulatory
benefits. Here, it was not possible to
quantify the costs and benefits of this
action compared to the consequences of
no regulation because there is no
specific "baseline" program to consider.
The appropriate regulations must be
established before the regulated activity
can even begin. Thus, the typical
perspectives on costs and benefits are
altered. Instead, the Agency evaluated
how the costs of commercial waste
management and disposal might change
in response to different levels of
protection from the containment
requirements. Similar evaluations were
not performed for the wastes from
atomic energy defense activities
because sufficient information was not
available.
  To evaluate the effects of different
levels of protection, EPA considered the
performance of different repository
designs in several different geologic
