Figure 2-4 A glaciological reconstruction of the North
American ice cover between 21,000 and 17,000 BP. A single
Laurentide dome is postulated over Hudson Bay because
postglacial isostatic uplift is greatest there, but the bed was
frozen beneath this dome because few, if any, erratics of
Paleozoic sedimentary rocks from Hudson Bay are found on
the surrounding Precambrian crystalline shield along the ice
divide. Ice streams are shown occupying the fore-deepened
interisland channels on the Arctic continental shelf and in
the ring of elongated lakes radiating from Hudson Bay and
located along the outer boundary of the shield. Floating ice
tongues and ice shelves may have formed beyond ice streams
occupying interisland channels. The extension of a grounded
portion of the Arctic Ocean ice-shelf cover onto northern
Alaska is entirely hypothetical, as discussed in Chapter 8.
Grounded ice lobes and ice fans formed beyond ice streams
occupying elongated lakes. Ice shelves probably became par-
tially grounded as they passed over sills in the narrow straits
between Baffin Island and Greenland, Greenland and Ice-
land, Iceland and the Faeroes, and the Faeroes and Scotland.
The southern Laurentide margin had a surface equilibrium
line separating an inner accumulation zone from an outer
ablation zone; the northern margin did not, except where
katabatic winds flowed down ice streams and into fiords. A
basal equilibrium line separating an inner melting zone from
an intermediate freezing zone was located about midway
across the Canadian Shield, and a second basal equilibrium
line separating the intermediate freezing zone from an outer
melting zone was located near the surface equilibrium line
along the southern Laurentide margin. The present divides
of the Hudson Bay and Great Lakes watersheds are the ap-
proximate locations of these two basal equilibrium lines (see
Chapters 5 and 6). Innuitian and Greenland domes are also


shown, together with minor domes over Nova Scotia, New-
foundland, Devon Island, Iceland, and elsewhere. The Cor-
dilleran ice divide probably had several domes. Ice-free areas
existed on the headlands between fiords, particularly in Baf-
fin Island and Greenland; and on the lee side of islands
separating ice streams, such as Banks Island. The pattern of
flowlines and basal thermal conditions shown is the one used
for the single-dome maximum Laurentide ice sheet recon-
struction in Chapter 6. Key: Thick solid lines are ice-sheet or
ice-cap margins, thick dashed lines are ice-shelf grounding
lines, thin solid lines are surface flowlines on grounded ice
sheets or ice caps, and thin dotted lines are their extensions
on floating ice shelves. Areas covered by large dots have
thawed or partially thawed beds, with thawed beds beneath
ice streams and partially thawed beds in zones of basal melt-
ing or freezing (the density of large dots is qualitatively pro-
portional to the degree of ice-bed uncoupling due to thawed
basal conditions). Areas covered by small dots denote sea ice
extent (the density of small dots is greatest along sea-ice
margins). Black areas are open seas beyond the ice-sheet
marine margins, and white blocks scattered in the black areas
represent tabular icebergs calved from these margins (partic-
ularly from ice shelves and where calving bays are migrating
up surging ice streams). Horizontal ruled lines along terres-
trial ice-sheet margins show sectors bordered by proglacial
lakes (no attempt is made to show the areal extent of these
lakes). Heavy broken lines in Figure 2-4 show the approxi-
mate inner and outer boundaries of the Canadian Shield.
Outlines of ice sheets are adapted from Figure 2-2, with
arbitrary ice borders drawn in places where Figure 2-2 lacks
information. Ice shelves are entirely hypothetical and there-
fore were not depicted in Figure 2-2; the possibility that such
ice shelves existed is discussed in Chapter 8.

needed for ice divides to adjust fully to ice mar-
gins that fluctuated on the order of 100 km every
1000 yr probably prevented full equilibrium con-
ditions along ice flowlines. The fourth and last
major assumption is that the number, type, and
distribution of basal thermal zones is sufficient
to minimize the effect of ice-bed coupling on ice-
sheet volume. Ice volume is affected by extremes
of ice-bed coupling; Figure 5-8 shows that dome
thickness for a melted-bed ice sheet is only 80
percent as great as for a frozen-bed ice sheet
covering the same area.
  The first three assumptions are really a single
assumption, namely, that full equilibrium con-
ditions existed everywhere-~at ice margins, be-
neath ice sheets, and along ice flowlines-~for all
ice sheets. This is an assumption of convenience.
The closest approach to full equilibrium condi-
tions was probably attained at the end of the
period from 21,000 to 17,000 BP. Large ice-mar-
gin fluctuations began shortly thereafter, bedrock
would have had 4000 yr to adjust to nearly con-
stant ice load, and ice flowlines were probably
significantly different before and after that pe-
riod insofar as ice divides and ice margins were
reacting to rapidly changing climatic conditions.
The assumption that all ice margins reached their
maximum extent simultaneously amounts to as-
suming that the largest ice lobes and fans along
terrestrial ice margins all formed simultaneously.
Ice lobes and fans are thin transient features
around the perimeter of the essentially steady-
state core of an ice sheet, and their combined ice
volume was about 0.05 ~ 106 km3. This compares
with the present-day volume of mountain gla-
ciers and small ice caps (see Chapter 3) and
amounts to only 0.1 m of sea-level equivalent.
The assumption that isostatic equilibrium was
attained can be tested by computing ice volumes
for various values of r in equation (6). We did
this for r = 0 (no isostatic sinking beneath ice
sheets), r = ~~~ (isostatic bending of continental
rock and flow of mantle rock), and r = ~~~ (isostatic
bending and flow of continental rock only). The
effect of varying r on ice volume was important.
For example, isostatic sinking of a horizontal bed
by ice of height and thickness h lowers the sur-
face to height h* and the bed to height -h~~, so
that isostatic sinking increases ice thickness in
the ratio (h* - h~~)/h = (1 + r)1/2 obtained from
equation (6). This ratio is 1.15 for r = ~~~ and 1.22
for r = ~~~, a change of 0.07, or about 6 percent.
Incomplete isostatic equilibrium would probably
change r by a similar amount, and an ice thick-


ness smaller by 6 percent would reduce late Wis-
consin-Weichselian ice volume by 4.5 ~ 106 km3
in our maximum ice-sheet reconstruction and
3.6 ~ 106 km3 in our minimum ice-sheet reconstruc-
tion. The assumption that flowline profiles are in
equilibrium is most reasonable for the nearly
steady-state core of the ice sheet and least rea-
sonable for the ice lobes and fans around the ice-
sheet perimeter. As already mentioned, subtract-
ing these ice lobes and fans decreases late Wis-
consin-Weichselian ice volume by 0.05 ~ 106 km3.
The assumption that basal thermal zones do not
significantly influence ice volume is valid so
long as at least three zones exist beneath major
ice sheets. Both glaciological theory and glacial
geological observations indicate that between
three and four nearly steady-state zones are the
norm-~an inner melting zone with minimal ero-
sion beneath ice divides, surrounded by a melted
zone with nearly uniform erosion, surrounded by
a freezing zone with selective linear erosion by
ice streams, surrounded by an outer melting zone
with steady-state basal deposition or an outer fro-
zen zone with basal deposition during disinte-
gration. Small ice sheets may have had only one
or two basal thermal zones, and our largest ice-
volume error would occur if we assigned a frozen
bed condition when a melted bed actually ex-
isted, or vice versa. For example, ice volume for
the small ice sheet on the Putorana Plateau is
reduced about 13 percent when a frozen bed
melts. This would reduce the late Wisconsin-
Weichselian ice volume by 0.05 ~ 106 km3 for
this ice sheet. Assigning the wrong number of
zones to a large ice sheet or the wrong kind of
zone to a small ice sheet could change the total
volume by 0.3 ~ 106 km3.
  One other assumption that influences late Wis-
consin-Weichselian sea-level estimates from ice-
volume calculations is that our late Wisconsin-
Weichselian Antarctic Ice Sheet reconstruction
is correct. Its additional late Wisconsin-Weich-
selian ice volume was included in the global ice
volumes computed using both our maximum and
minimum reconstructions of Northern Hemi-
sphere ice sheets. Like the maximum Northern
Hemisphere ice sheets, we reconstructed the late
Wisconsin-Weichselian Antarctic Ice Sheet to
the edge of the continental shelf. Chapter 7 re-
views literature that presents alternate argu-
ments against any substantial increase in Antarc-
tic ice volume during late Wisconsin-Weichselian
time. However, that alternate conclusion is based
partly on interpretations of indirect evidence,

  The usual procedure for conducting a triaxial compression test is to first apply
the confining pressure all round the cylinder (i.e., ~1 = ~3 = ~) and then to apply
the axial load ~1 - ~ as the lateral pressure is held constant. In this case, the
triaxial compression experiment can be interpreted as the superposition of a
uniaxial compression test on an initial state of all-round compression. However,
the actual path of loading in service may be quite different; as some rocks demon-
strate strong path effects it may then be desirable to follow different procedures.
For example, the stresses in the rock at the front of a traveling plane wave are
applied simultaneously in all directions. With computer or manual feedback
control, it is possible to follow almost any prescribed path of loading, although as
will be shown later, not all paths can result in fracture under load. For the best
results and a clear interpretation of the effects of load, both the axial shortening,
and the lateral expansion of the specimen should be monitored during loading as
discussed later.
  The Brazilian test, described for cylindrical concrete specimens in ASTM
designation1 C496-71, is convenient for gaining an estimate of the tensile strength
of rock. It has been found that a rock core about as long as its diameter will split
along the diameter and parallel to the cylinder axis when loaded on its side in a
compression machine (Figure 3.2c). The reason for this can be demonstrated by
examining the stress inside a disc loaded at opposite sides of a diametral plane. In
such a configuration, the horizontal stresses perpendicular to the loaded diameter
are uniform and tensile with magnitude


where P is the compression load, d is the cylinder diameter, and t is the thickness
of the disc (the length of the cylinder). It is much easier to perform this type of test
than to arrange the precise alignment and end preparation required for a direct
tensile test.
  The "Brazilian tensile strength" is estimated from the test result by reporting
the value of ~t, B corresponding to the peak compression load. It should be under-
stood, however, that the actual cause of failure may also reflect the action of the
vertical stress along the vertical diameter in concert with the horizontal tension;
the vertical stress is nonuniform increasing from a compressive stress of three
times ~t, B at the center of the disc to progressively higher values as the ends are
approached. According to the Griffith theory of failure, the critical point ought
to be the center where the ratio of compression to tension is 3. With a principal
stress ratio of 3, failure ought to result from the application of the tensile stress
alone, without any complication from the simultaneous compression parallel to
the eventual rupture plane. In fact, the Brazilian test has been found to give a


S 50~ E. Coordinate axes will be taken as follows: x is horizontal to the east; y is
horizontal north; and z is upward.
  The bearing of the upward normal to the plane is the same as the bearing
of its dip, and it rises at a vertical angle complement to the amount of dip. To
apply Equations A1.16 to calculate the stresses across the given plane, given the
local state of stress, we describe each of the axes x', y', z' by a horizontal angle (~)
and a vertical angle (~) as shown in Figure A1.13; ~ is the counterclockwise angle
from x to the horizontal projection of the axis in question while ~ is the vertical
angle between the axis and its horizontal projection. The line 0x' is in the direction
of the upward normal. It proves convenient to take y' positive when directed up the
steepest slope of the plane, that is, opposite to the dip vector, and z' along the strike,
as shown in Figure A1.9. For the indicated bedding plane then, the bearings and
rise angles of the three axes are (Figure A1.12):

conversion of cristobalite to chalcedony or quartz.
  The distribution of the silica minerals in Y-7 and
Y-8 is first considered in order of increasing stability.
Opal is the dominant silica phase in the hot-spring
sinter of both drill holes and is also an abundant ce-
menting mineral of the near-surface sediments; opal is
sparse or absent elsewhere throughout the drill holes.
At depth, opal occurs only locally in veinlets in the flow
breccia of Y-8. Both recognized species of cristobalite
are rather erratic in distribution (figs. 3 and 4; tables 5
and 7). ~-cristobalite is most common in veinlets in the
sediments of Y-7 and in veinlets in the flow breccia of
both drill holes. ~-cristobalite is present in the
groundmass of most core from Y-7 but is absent from
significant intervals of Y-8; a few veinlets include
~-cristobalite as a relatively early mineral. Chal-
cedony is very rare in groundmass and veinlets of Y-7
and also in the groundmass of Y-8 but is characteristi-
cally the earliest veinlet mineral in the sediments of
Y-8. Quartz has not been reported in Y-7 but is sparse
to abundant in the groundmass and veinlets of Y-8.
Thus, the hotter environment of Y-8 clearly favors
quartz and chalcedony, and with rare exceptions these
minerals are abundant where opal and ~-cristobalite
are absent.
  This complex picture of the distribution of the silica
minerals can best be understood by focusing on their
occurrence and relative ages in veinlets. Of the 21
veinlets listed in tables 5 and 7 that have two or more
silica species, the relative ages from oldest to youngest
in 18 of these are quartz, chalcedony, ~-cristobalite,
~-cristobalite, and opal; note that this sequence is also
in the order of highest to lowest thermodynamic stabil-
ity. Y-7-209 (-63.7 m) is a probable exception, as are
the veinlets from Y-8-185.3 (-56.5 m) and Y-8-197.7
(-60.3 m), where quartz is deposited on chalcedony.
The rarity of these exceptions is surprising in view of
the common deposition of quartz on chalcedony at a
very late stage in cavities in chalcedonic sinter and
elsewhere (White and others, 1956).
  The usual sequence from most stable to least stable
is also in the order of increasing solubility in water at
constant temperature (Fournier, 1973). At 100~C, for
example, the solubility of quartz is about 50 ppm, chal-
cedony about 87 ppm, ~-cristobalite about 115 ppm,
~-cristobalite about 250 ppm, and amorphous silica
about 370 ppm. Chemical geothermometers indicate
that the thermal waters of Upper Geyser Basin rise to
the surface from a reservoir that is probably rather
homogeneous at a temperature close to 200~C (Four-
nier, 1973, p. 134; Fournier and Truesdell, 1973). At
200~C, the solubility of quartz is 260 ppm. With
adiabatic cooling (all excess heat converting water to
steam) to an eventual surface termperature of 93~C,


the maximum content of silica in the residual water is
about 330 ppm; if boiled to an intermediate stage of
adiabatic cooling at 150~C, the residual water has 290
ppm of silica. From these relations, we conclude that
water from the reservoir is strongly supersaturated
with respect to quartz, chalcedony, and ~-cristobalite
at all temperatures in the drill holes, but is only
slightly supersaturated with respect to ~-cristobalite
and is unsaturated with respect to opal at all tempera-
tures higher than about 80~C (at depths below -15 m
in Y-7 and -6 m in Y-8).
  The indicated occurrence of opal at temperatures as
high as 140~C in Y-7 and 170~C in Y-8 is inconsistent
with these conclusions. Three possible explanations
are: (1) the deep opal was deposited when reservoir
temperatures and the silica contents of upflowing
water were much higher; conversion to cristobalite has
not yet occurred; (2) the deep opal is everywhere asso-
cited with undevitrified obsidian, which could have a
solubility as high as that of amorphous silica (R.O.
Fournier, oral commun., 1976); the hot water has lo-
cally equilibrated with obsidian and has then risen and
cooled enough to deposit opal; or (3) the deep opal iden-
tified only by its optical properties (isotropic; index of
refraction about 1.46), is nowhere abundant enough to
isolate and confirm as being amorphous by X-ray; it
may actually be isotropic ~-cristobalite of low crystal-
linity. We suspect, but cannot prove, that the third
alternative is correct.
  How are the two strong tendencies for paragenesis
from most stable to least stable, and for mutual exclu-
sion of quartz and chalcedony from cristobalite and
opal, best reconciled? Were all silica minerals initially
deposited in their present form or does the sequence
indicate conversion through time from less stable
forms to more stable forms? White, Brannock and
Murata (1956) and Murata and Larson (1975) have
concluded that each silica mineral forms from water
only slightly supersaturated with respect to that min-
eral; a water supersaturated with respect to opal tends
to precipitate opal and not other forms, and a
chalcedony-supersaturated water does not precipitate
quartz. If this concept is valid, the present mineral as-
semblages are best explained by consistently high
silica contents in the waters of the main upflow chan-
nels, but with eventual self-sealing and isolation of in-
dividual small channels, veinlets, and rock masses.
With such isolation, or semi-isolation, each unit of rock
volume can then behave much like a closed system,
with pore water evolving toward lower silica contents
as more stable silica minerals are in succession recon-
stituted from less stable minerals. With respect to each
successive mineral, the pore water is successively
supersaturated, just saturated, and then undersatu-

			Abstract

  The temperature of the dehydration of interlayer water of Na-montmorillonite (SWy-1,
American Clay Mineral Society Source Clay) is determined at pressures to 1 kbar, using
differential thermal analysis (DTA). Two dehydration reactions occur, about 40~ and 100~C
above the boiling curve of water. Above the critical point of water the dehydration
reactions show only a modest increase of temperature with pressure. No significant
differences in temperature were found using different heating rates and different size
fractions, as defined by their hydraulic diameter. The presence of two dehydration
reactions suggests that not all interlayer water is bonded equally; a distinction may be made
between weakly bonded and strongly bonded water. It is concluded that hydrated Na-
montmorillonite is stable under normal pressure and temperature distributions in sedimen-
tary basins; in these basins dehydration must involve more complex chemical interactions
with pore fluids. The large increase in the stability of a hydrated montmorillonite with a
modest increase in pressure may have important bearing in its use in nuclear waste
disposal.


  Although early work had been done on the composition of uranium ions
most of the recent work has been carried on by various Atomic Energy
Commission research projects. Pisani (25) did the early work on the car-
bonate complexes and Wilder (31) has done recent work on the composition
of the uranyl carbonate complex. Pascal (27) investigated the stability of
uranium hydrophosphate and uranium pyrophosphate. Kunin (20) de-
termined the stability of the uranyl ion as a function of pH. Harned (11)
worked on mixtures of uranium IV and uranium VI.
  Most of the stability investigations to date are of little use to the geol-
ogist. This results because concentrations of uranium ions above neutral-
ization amounts have not been obtained and the stability of the uranium
ions at elevated temperatures have not been investigated.
  Since the writing of this report Garrels (8) has published additional data
on the thermodynamic relations of uranium oxides and Gruner (9) has
published the results of his recent geochemical experiments.

		METHODS OF URANIUM ANALYSES

  Two analytical procedures were used for the determination of uranium
in solution, each depending on the concentration of the sample. The Jones
reductor with a potassium permanganate titration was used for the analyses
of solutions with a uranium concentration of 10-3 M or greater. Solutions
with uranium concentrations between 10-4 M and 10-6 M were analyzed by
colorimetric methods. All precipitates were analyzed by x-ray diffraction
methods.
  The Jones Reductor Method.-~This method of analysis depends upon the
quantitative oxidation-reduction of uranium. In the Jones reductor,
uranium is quantitatively reduced to uranium (IV) and uranium (III),
then aerated completely to uranium (IV), and finally titrated to uranium
(VI) by means of a suitable oxidant.
  The Jones reductor used in these experiments was a 6-inch column of
amalgamated zinc in a cylindrical reduction tube. Solutions of uranium,
in 4N sulfuric acid, were allowed to pass through the zinc column at a rate
of 15 ml per minute. The column was then washed thoroughly with 4N
sulfuric acid and finally by water. The resulting mixture of uranium (IV)
and (III) was aerated by rapid agitation with a magnetic stirrer to insure
oxidation of red uranium (III) to green uranium (IV). Quadravalent
uranium is stable in the presence of air for a few hours but over a period of
days is completely oxidized to uranium (IV). The solution of uranium

FIG. 4. DTA patterns of heulandite and clinoptilolite.


  Thermal gravimetric analyses of heulandite at a heating rate of 40~ per
hour show a sharp steepening of the weight loss curve also in the region of
250~ C. No break in the weight loss curve was noted for clinoptilolite.
  Other authors have indicated thermal reactions for heulandite close to
120~ C., but no evidence of such phenomena could be found in this study
(see Milligan and Weiser, 1937).
  If the differences in thermal stability between heulandite and clinoptilo-
lite are due solely to the nature of the exchange cation in each species
(vide infra) one might expect a calcium-exchanged clinoptilolite to ex-
hibit the low temperature reactions and low thermal stability of heuland-
ite. Conversely, a sodium-exchanged heulandite should be more ther-
mally stable than the calcium variety. Such is not the case. Clinoptilolite
from Hector, California, was almost completely exchanged to the calcium
form by repeated slurrying with a large excess of a 1 Normal calcium
chloride solution. A chemical analysis of the washed product gave 6.4
wt-% CaO, 0.2 wt-% Na2O. If it is assumed that no exchange of the
potassium and magnesium occurred, the clinoptilolite product is greater
than 90% calcium exchanged. The d spacings and intensities of the peaks
are virtually identical with those of the original clinoptilolite. A sodium-
rich form of heulandite could not be prepared by the above methods even
when boiling sodium chloride solutions were used.

thereby reducing I by at least one-half (Table 1).
Third, it is possible that past climates were sub-
stantially warmer or drier than those of historic
time; I and P could have been lower and (or) E
could have been higher in direct response to
climatic change.
  It is unlikely, however, that any of these three
conditions prevailed for large fractions of the
past 100,000-130,000 yr. And even if one or
more of them did, Tulare Lake's paleolimnology
suggests that, with a few possible exceptions, the
lake still overflowed frequently.

Volume of Tulare Lake Basin

  The Corcoran Clay Member is the only
known evidence of a Quaternary lake basin in
the Tulare Lake area with a volume vastly
greater than that of historic Tulare Lake basin.
Lacustrine deposits of the past 100,000-130,000
yr neither approach the Corcoran in lateral
extent, nor are known to exceed greatly the
extent of historic Tulare Lake at overflow level
(Figs. 4, 6). Tulare Lake basin probably was
somewhat deeper than it is today during deposi-
tion of the upper part of the Chatom silt and
during deposition of the lower part of the Blake-
ley Canal silt (Table 3). It is unlikely, however,
that the late Wisconsin basin was too large to
allow overflow under a climate like that of the
19th century. If post-Chatom sedimentation in
Tulare Lake has almost offset tectonic subsi-
dence at the 0.33-0.40 m/1,000 yr rates implied
by depth to the Corcoran Clay Member (Figs. 4,
7), and if the lake's spillway has undergone little
post-Chatom incision or aggradation, then the
post-Chatom volume of Tulare Lake basin has
been decreased chiefly by subsidence of the spill-
way. If the spillway has subsided in post-
Chatom time at the rate of 0.2 m/1,000 yr
implied by depth to the Corcoran (Fig. 2), then
11,000-13,000 yr of spillway subsidence affect-
ing a 2,000-km2 lake would have reduced lake-
basin volume by 5-6 km3. Tulare Lake basin
therefore may have held ~12-13 km3 at the
Chatom-Blakeley Canal transition, nearly twice
as much as the historic basin but only 1-2 km3
more than the volume attained by Tulare Lake
when overflowing at altitude 66 m in A.D.
1853, 1862, and 1868. From these considera-
tions, we generalize that there is no plausible
value of V that could have kept Tulare Lake
from overflowing frequently during the past
100,000-130,000 yr without a substantial de-
crease in (I + P) - E.

Course of the Kings River

  Although little is known about prehistoric
variations in I at Tulare Lake, two properties of
the Kings River's exposed distributary systems

timate for northern New Mexico given in
Table 1 may be too small.
  On the other hand, the positions of small
(<1 km2) glaciers and of nivation hollows
(Flint, 1971, p. 134) should accurately reflect
the position of orographic snowline. There-
fore, the orographic depression estimates
for northeast Arizona (1200 m), east-central
Arizona (790-910 m), and central New
Mexico (1300 m), all based on such features,
do not suffer from the above error. The same
is true for the regional depression estimates,
because they are not based on cirque eleva-
tions. However, the climatic indicators used
in locating the modern snowline for the
listed depression estimates must now be ex-
amined.
  Today, snowline lies above most moun-
tains in the Southwest. This means that it's
altitude must be reconstructed from climatic
data. Antevs (1952), Leopold (1951), and
Richmond (1965) believed modern snowline
to be controlled primarily by the summer
(July) freezing isotherm. Thus they located
modern snowline in the southern Rocky
Mountains at the radiosonde-determining
position of this isotherm. However, this
supposed correlation of modern snowline
with the July 0~C isotherm is not supported
by ground-level, long-term, meteorologic
data. Figure 1 shows that the present oro-
graphic snowline obtained from elevations
of modern small glaciers (Table 2) rises
southward from latitude 46 to 40~N at no
less than 100 m/1~ latitude. If higher latitude
glaciers are considered, the gradient may


be steeper, but for the present purpose the
minimum slope needed to fit points within
these latitude limits is most relevant. It is
clear that modern small glaciers do not
match the slope of the 0~C July isotherm,
which rises at a gradient of only 25 m/1~ lati-
tude. The -6~C annual isotherm matches
modern snowline much better, both in terms
of gradient and elevation (Fig. 1). Thus, the
available data favor use of the -6~C annual
isotherm as the best indicator of modern
orographic snowline in the southwest.

A Revised Estimate of Snowline Depression

  As noted, where the depression estimates
in Table 1 are based on (1) modern snowline
located by the July 0~C isotherm and/or (2)
relict cirques at the head of glaciated val-
leys, the depression estimates may be in
error. Therefore, as an aid in estimating an
average "true" orographic depression value
for the southwest, Wisconsin cirques from
Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico were
selected on the basis of lack of evidence for
large-scale valley glaciation. These were ob-
tained from the literature, and modern topo-
graphic maps were used to check cirque
floor elevations (Table 3). The cirques in
Nevada are considered late Wisconsin in

by second-growth Jeffrey pine (Pinus jef-

on the right-hand sides of (1)-(3) evaluated every
fifth time step (i.e., every 30 min). Starting from
initial conditions for 1 May as obtained from an
earlier independent run, the model was integrated
through the months of May, June and July, with a
fixed distribution of (July) sea-surface temperature
and daily adjustments of the solar zenith angle.
A statistical quasi-equilibrium was reached during
June, and the July climatic statistics were determined
by averaging the 6 h solutions during the last 31 days
of the integration. About 15 min is required on an
computer to simulate one model day.

3. Ice-age boundary conditions

  In addition to the specification of the various
physical constants and empirical parameters used, the
atmospheric model requires the specification of the
surface character (i.e., whether bare land, open water
or ice-covered land or water), along with the surface
elevation, the surface temperature of the ocean and
the surface albedo. The July distribution of these
surface boundary conditions as assembled by CLIMAP
(1976) from a variety of paleoclimatic sources for the
ice-age of 18 000 YBP are shown in Figs. 3-5, along
with the corresponding distributions for the present
July. These conditions are those used in the model's
numerical simulations of the July ice-age and present-
day July climate, as appropriate.

a. Surface elevation and ice sheets

  The elevation of the earth's surface as reconstructed
for 18 000 YBP is shown in Fig. 3a, along with the


these corrections to the diagram would lower the curve C D E in the im-
mediate vicinity of D, smoothing out the angle at that point, would leave it
unchanged where it intersects the ordinate of 0~, and would carry the point
E farther to the right. It would raise the curve A B at A, and lower it at
B, leaving the central portion unchanged. The point A, or the intersection
with the horizontal axis, would be thrown to the left.
  Fifthly, in the construction of the curves no allowance was made for
evaporation during summer. The curve D E includes only winter evapora-
tion, the curve A B only summer melting. The rate of evaporation for
snow and ice has its maximum at 0~, its law changing at that point. In
the general law for aqueous evaporation, the rate of evaporation is a func-
tion of the difference between the saturation tension corresponding to the
temperature of the evaporated substance and the actual vapor tension of
the evaporating air. Since snow and ice can not rise in temperature above
0~, they can only be evaporated when the aqueous tension of the air in
contact with them is less than the saturation tension for 0~. If it rises above
that, moisture is deposited on the ice as dew, instead of being abstracted
from it. In all but very exceptional cases the range of summer tempera-
tures under which n~~v~~ can evaporate is small-~from 0~ to 5~ or 6~. The
effect of the evaporation is to retard the wasting of the ice, for the energy
consumed by it is deducted from that available for melting, and a unit of
solar heat can melt seven times as much ice as it can evaporate.1 The cor-
rection, if applied to the curve of melting, would slightly increase its upward
concavity.
  Sixthly, the winter evaporation embodied with the winter precipitation
in the curve D E is tacitly assumed to have a rate corresponding to the
mean annual temperature; its rate is really less, being a function of the
mean winter temperature. An error is thus manifestly introduced, and this
error is greatest for the annual temperatures corresponding to short winters.
A corresponding correction of the diagram would raise the line D E by
amounts increasing progressively from D to E.


averages of P and (P - E), using the modified equation


where e is the ratio of total land area to the area of internal
drainage (endorheic area) within this belt. We assume that
P~~PL~~PB. As a first approximation, in view of the paucity of
runoff data from the subtropical deserts, the adjustable para-
meter e was introduced to partition the runoff between the areas
of internal drainage in which closed lakes can form and the
areas draining to the ocean. The modern area-average value of
e for the study area is 2.6 (ref. 25). Thus, for the modern
simulation, ~38% (1/2.6) of the model-generated area-average
(P - E) is available for runoff to closed interior basins. No
attempt has been made to estimate the z ratio for lakes within
the areas of external drainage, to which equation (1) is not
applicable. In fact, many additional lakes developed during the
early and mid-Holocene along river systems draining into the
ocean26,27.
  The CCM does not calculate EL explicitly for hypothesized
interior lakes. Moreover, except for large enclosed seas, such
as the Mediterranean and Caspian, its coarse spatial resolution
precludes explicit simulation of inland water bodies. A modern
value of EL = 2,600 mm yr-1 was assumed. This is representative
of Lake Chad (13~N) in dry years28 and is comparable with the
evaporation rate calculated by the CCM for tropical ocean areas
with offshore winds. It is also comparable to the rate obtained
if the model-generated winds and mixing ratios over land (8.9-
26.6~ N) are adjusted for flow over a water surface with a drag
coefficient intermediate between land and open ocean. In the
palaeolake simulations, EL has been varied in proportion to the
calculated changes in land evaporation, to allow for variations
in surface temperature, humidity and wind speed.

Results
The area-averaged CCM results and their statistical signific-
ance are summarized in Figs 3-4, and Table 1. In July, the net
radiation increases from 164 W m-2 at 18 kyr BP to a peak of
181 W m-2 in the 9 kyr BP experiment (12% greater than the
control) and then decreases again (Fig. 3a). In January it varies
in the opposite direction, reaching its minimum (-16%) at 9 kyr
BP.
  The surface-temperature lowering at 18 kyr BP is 3.5 K in
January and 2.0 K in July (Fig. 3b). Although the estimated
mean-annual temperature rises rapidly after 12 kyr BP and does
not differ significantly from the control case in the 9, 6 and 3 kyr
BP experiments, the seasonal temperature range is 2-4 K greater


than today between 15 and 6 kyr BP, and 3-4 K greater at 12
and 9 kyr BP. The highest July temperature departure (+1.3 K)
occurs in the 9 kyr BP experiment.
  The simulated changes in the January surface wind field are
small. In July, the CCM indicates weak northwesterly flow at
18 and 0 kyr BP (Fig. 3c). In marked contrast, the wind direction
at 15, 12, 9 and 6 kyr BP is southwesterly. This intensified
low-level monsoon flow, consistent with lower pressure over the
continents and higher pressure over the oceans, reaches its
greatest strength and statistical significance at 9 kyr BP, implying
an increased transport of moisture from the oceans onto the
Northern Hemisphere land masses.
  Figure 4 summarizes the simulated hydrological cycle for each
experiment. In July, the precipitation rate is lowest at 18 and
0 kyr BP, attaining its maximum values in the 9 and 6 kyr BP
simulations (2.1 and 18 mm day-1 greater than the control value
of 5.6 mm day-1, respectively, representing 30-35% increase in
precipitation (p<0.05). Although the land evaporation rate is
also greater (p<0.01) at these times, as a result of higher summer


Miller and Wendorf report (136): "Flora and fauna,
along with such physical features as buried pond de-
posits, clearly indicate deposition under conditions more
moist than at present." Although they considered such
evidence to be known from many parts of the South-
west, they noted that direct fossil evidence for climatic
fluctuation is exceedingly sparse in the alluvium they
studied in the Tesuque Valley. At Chaco Canyon, Bryan
(28) was careful to point out that the postpluvial
alluvial deposits there did not produce incontestable
fossil evidence of a wetter climate in the past. Regard-
ing erosion and alluviation in the Near East near Jarmo,
Wright (185) took the precaution to comment that his
climatic interpretation of drought during the postglacial
optimum rested largely on the occurrence of erosion at
that time, not on fossil evidence of aridity. Other geolo-
gists have not always been equally candid in identifying
their presuppositions.
  If alluviation occurred under wetter climates and
cutting occurred during or following drought, as is
commonly assumed, one might expect to see such evi-
dence in the pollen record. Such evidence is not ap-
parent. On the contrary, pollen evidence of wetter
conditions during the postpluvial period was found
in sediments closely associated with the time of alti-
thermal erosion.
  The oldest period of alluviation, prior to altither-
mal erosion, is commonly considered to represent de-
position under relatively humid conditions. This con-
clusion is based on presence of extinct animal remains
and it raises the question of the ecological and climatic


meaning of the mammoth, camel, and other fossil
mammals.

Extinct Megafauna. Fossil evidence often viewed as
proof that deposition occurred under humid climates
is the presence of extinct animal remains in certain
early postpluvial alluvial beds (deposition 1 of Table 8).
The suggestion that elephants, horses, camels, and other
large mammals of western North America succumbed
to drought following the last pluvial period can be
traced at least to the time of Russell (149). Russell's
view has become embedded in the scientific literature
(111, 1, 27, 104, 91, 78, 79, 7, 62). An essential part
of the theory is the notion that to thrive large animals
require luxuriant vegetation. For example, regarding
New Mexico near the San Jon site, Judson (95) wrote:
"It is inconceivable that a mammoth could survive on
the meager vegetation and surface water of today...."
Is there biological evidence for such an opinion?
  Prehistorians and geologists might recall the re-
flections of Darwin (46) "that large animals require a
luxuriant vegetation has been a general assumption
which has passed from one work to another; but I do
not hesitate to say that it is completely false, and that
it has vitiated the reasoning of geologists on some
points of great interest in the ancient history of the
world. The prejudice has probably been derived from
India and the Indian islands, where troops of elephants,
noble forests, and impenetrable jungles are associated
together in everyone's mind. If, however, we refer to
any work of travels through the southern parts of


crosses it, but maintains a nearly horizontal crest for at least a third of the
way to the point where the river has cut through; it then falls off with an
abrupt descent to a level six or eight feet lower, the crest of the structure
at the same time becoming broadened and curved slightly westward. Con-
tinuing southward, one descends three more similar scarps of less height
before reaching the lowest point in the embankment. Each of these
descents is formed by the end of a comparatively thin layer of gravel that
was added by the currents to the surface of the structure, and would no
doubt have been carried along its whole extent had not a rise in the lake
caused the currents to begin the formation of another similar sheet of gravel
near the shore and at a higher level. Each of the steps in the crest of the
embankment represents a pause in the rise of the waters of the ancient lake.
The highest in the series was the last formed. The incompleteness in this
instance furnishes the suggestion that similar embankments which seem from
their form to be homogeneous may in reality be highly compound. The
irregular stratification of the embankment retaining Humboldt Lake is
illustrated by the following sketch of the section exposed on the right side
of the channel that has been eroded through it  The general inclination of
the strata on the west side of the embankment is much greater than on

atmosphere at such times. Dust-storms are common on the deserts during
the arid season, and impart to the atmosphere a peculiar haziness that lasts
for days and perhaps weeks after the storms have subsided. Whirl-winds
supply a characteristic feature in the atmospheric phenomena of the Far
West especially during calm weather, as noted already, and frequently form
hollow dust-columns two or three thousand feet or even more in height,
which may many times be seen in considerable numbers moving here and
there over the valleys. The loose material thus swept about at the caprice
of the winds tends to accumulate on certain areas and forms dunes or drifts
that at times cover many square miles of surface. During its journey
across the country the material which finds a resting place in the dunes
becomes assorted with reference to size and weight, so that the resulting
sand-drifts are usually homogeneous in their composition, but are character-
ized by extreme irregularity of structure when seen in section. In the
Lahontan basin the suba~~~rial deposits are usually composed of fine, sharp
quartz sand, but in some instances small drifts are principally formed of the
cases of ostracoid crustaceans.
  A large area buried beneath sand dunes of post-Lahontan date occurs
a few miles north of Winnemucca and extends westward from the lower
part of Little Humboldt Valley to the desert between Black Butte and the
Do~~a Schee Hills. This belt of drifting sand is about forty miles long from
east to west by eight or ten miles in width. The drifts are fully seventy-five
feet thick and present their steeper slopes to the eastward, thus indicating the
direction in which the whole vast field of sand is slowly travelling. No
measurements of the rate at which these drifts advance has been made, but
their progress is evidently quite rapid, as it has necessitated a number of
changes in the roads in the southern part of Little Humboldt Valley during
the past few years. In some places in the same region the telegraph-poles
have been buried so deeply that they required to be spliced in order to
keep the wires above the crests of the dunes. The sand is here of a light
creamy-yellow color, and forms beautifully curved ridges and waves that
are covered with fret-work of wind-ripples, and frequently marked in the
most curious manner by the foot-prints of animals, thus forming strange
hieroglyphics that are sometimes difficult to translate.

val: core L-30, described in this report, extends to 160
ft (49 m); core 254, described here with permission of
Kerr-McGee Chemical Corp., extends to about 260 ft
(80 m); cores KK, SL-34, and S-2 (Flint and Gale,
1958, figs. 3, 4) extend to about 300 ft (90 m); a core
described by Gale (1914, p 289-290) extends to 628 ft
(191 m).
  Flint and Gale (1958) described the major stratigra-
phic units of the deposit and applied the following in-
formal names: Overburden Mud, Upper Salt, Parting
Mud, Lower Salt, Bottom Mud, and Mixed Layer.
Smith (1962) subdivided the Lower Salt into 13 units
and the Mixed Layer into 6 units (fig. 4).
  The stratigraphic subdivisions of the Mixed Layer
are thick units distinguished by changes in evaporite
mineral content that indicate significant differences
in the chemical nature of the lake in which they were
deposited. The Bottom Mud, Lower Salt, Parting
Mud, and Upper Salt are relatively homogeneous
units defined on the basis of lithology. Contacts be-
tween them are sharp and considered to be about the
same age throughout the deposit. The Overburden
Mud, which is more heterogeneous, consists of inter-
bedded mud and saline layers. In the central part of
the deposit, its basal contact is gradational and con-
sists of a zone having an upward increase in the per-
centage of clastic-rich mud layers and a decrease in
saline layers; around the edges, the contact is at the
base of a zone of solid mud that includes near-shore
equivalents of horizons in the Upper Salt as well as in
the Overburden Mud.
  In studying cores, it is generally easy to separate the
mud units from the saline units. The muds6 are mostly
dark green to brown, soft, and appear nonporous.
They consist chiefly of chemical precipitates made up
of Ca, Na, and Mg combined with CO3. The major
minerals are fine-grained aragonite and dolomite and
fine- or coarse-grained gaylussite and pirssonite (the
names and chemical compositions of the nonclastic
minerals in the Searles Lake evaporites are given in
table 1). A few mud layers have large percentages of
clay-sized halite, or small percentages of fine- or
coarse-grained borax or northupite. Galeite, schairer-
ite, and tychite occur in traces. Authigenic silicates


such as K-feldspar, analcime, phillipsite, and searle-
site are locally abundant. Clastic silt and clay, and
partially decomposed organic material, are always
present but subordinate. Almost all mineral identifi-
cations of fine-grained components in the muds are by
X-ray diffraction techniques.
  The salines are mostly white to dark gray, hard, and
porous. They consist chiefly of precipitates made up
of Na, K, and Mg combined with CO3, HCO3, SO4, Cl,
or B4O7. The major minerals are coarse-grained halite,
trona, hanksite, burkeite, borax, nahcolite, mirabilite,
thenardite, northupite, and aphthitalite (glaserite).
Small quantities of sulfohalite, teepleite, and tincal-
conite occur locally. Mineral identifications of saline
minerals are by visual inspection (of large crystals)
and X-ray diffraction methods.
  The identification and correlation of mud and sa-
line units in cores is based upon multiple criteria.
Thickness is the most reliable single parameter, but
mineralogy, crystal size and habit, bedding character,
and the number and positions of thin layers of muds
in salines (or, rarely, salines in muds) provide sup-
porting evidence. The Upper Salt, Parting Mud, and
units within the Lower Salt generally maintain similar
thickness over an extent of a kilometer or so, and these
thicknesses form a pattern that can be matched with
confidence in nearby cores. The mud beds in these se-

creases in human mutations due to the action of any environmental agent
is still difficult. For somatic abnormalities induced in utero by radiation,
the position is somewhat intermediate-~that is, some human data have
been obtained, but we also depend on animal data.
  The emphasis on human studies for determining the somatic effects of
ionizing radiation remains valid, although theoretical and experimental
studies continue to be important in extending our basic knowledge. For
most types of health effects occurring in those exposed to radiation, we
now have considerable human experience, as the balance of this report
shows. Moreover, in terms of establishing human risk estimates, it is a
well-recognized principle in the field of environmental toxicology that
results obtained in animal experiments are not necessarily translatable
directly to human populations. For example, the fact that the human pop-
ulation is genetically heterogeneous, with widely varying individual
physiologic and biochemical characteristics, makes it likely that there are
subpopulations at special risk from radiation exposure. It is difficult to
simulate this kind of heterogeneity in animal populations, other than by
inferences drawn from species variation in responses or from differences
in susceptibility between strains of a given species.
  We lack adequate information on the effects of low radiation doses in
human populations, and in this regard we still depend on concepts that
have been developed on the basis of experimental studies. In this report,
these studies are discussed in some detail.
  Although epidemiologic studies constitute our principal source of infor-
mation on somatic effects of ionizing radiation in human populations, one
must recognize that there are problems in their use. The first problem
arises from the fact that generally the group has been exposed to radiation
because of some particular characteristic and thus may not be represen-
tative of the population at large. The reasons why those exposed to radia-
tion are not typical of the general population may not affect radiation sen-
sitivity, but an appropriate comparison group is nonetheless required.
  The epidemiologic technique to deal with the scientific problem of a
potentially biased sample is to obtain a control group matched as nearly as
possible to the exposed persons. In radiation epidemiology, considerable
effort has been made to deal with the question of the suitability of a con-
trol group. For example, in the Japanese atomic-bomb survivors, the zero-
dose groups (those in the cities at the time of the bombing, but so far away
from the bomb detonation that they were not exposed) are useful controls,
although in the Nagasaki sample they are comparatively few. An alter-
native method has been to consider the regression of effects (such as
cancer rates) on radiation dose. Systematic differences in rates of cancer
not related to radiation exposure, for example, might be expected to be

to determine whether the simplest extrapolation curve, the linear no-
threshold model adopted by the subcommittee to estimate cancer risks
from low LET radiation, is reasonable or not. As the above comments in-
dicate, use of the linear extrapolation can hardly be considered to provide
an "extreme" estimate of low-dose risk.
  The only population study that does provide dose-response data of this
type is that of the Japanese A-bomb survivors. It is not generally recog-
nized that the strength of the Japanese data in epidemiologic terms lies in
data obtained for low doses, less than 100 rad kerma. The major part of
the number of survivors with significant exposures are in the two dose
groups, 10-49 rad kerma, or a mean tissue dose of about 11 rad, and
50-99 rad kerma, or a mean tissue dose of about 35 rad. For doses greater
than 200 rad kerma, about 120 rad mean tissue dose, the numbers of sur-
vivors included in the Life Span Study October 1, 1950, and who were over
age 20 at the time of the bombing (the group in which nearly all cancer
deaths had occurred between 1950 and 1974) were only 942 in Hiroshima
and 684 in Nagasaki, numbers that are small enough that if the dose is
fractionated further into three dose categories, as has been done in RERF
Report 8, the results are likely to lead to statistically unstable estimates of
excess cancer risk, especially in Nagasaki. Thus, it is fair to say that in the
long run, a principal value of data obtained from this study population
will be to permit estimation of cancer risk from acute exposures in a range
of 10-35 rad mean tissue dose.
  The fact that the A-bomb survivors are the only large group with a wide
range of whole body radiation exposure makes them singularly important
in dose-response evaluation of the carcinogenic effect of radiation in man.
There was general agreement for this position among the subcommittee
members, and it was the reason that extensive debate concerning inter-
pretation of the follow-up data through 1974 from RERF Report 8, took
place up to the final meeting of the subcommittee.
  The areas of discussion revolved especially around interpretation of the
Nagasaki data to evaluate effects of low LET radiation. Because the
Hiroshima bomb led to a significant neutron exposure whose effect was
difficult to assess independently, the Nagasaki data thus became the basis
for defining low LET radiation effects. Unfortunately, the Nagasaki study
population is much smaller than the Hiroshima group, and is especially
small in the zero dose category, the accepted control population for the ex-
posed populations. A better control population can be developed by com-
bining the zero dose group and those exposed to 1-9 rad kerma (mean
tissue dose about 1.8 rad), an approach which has been widely used to im-
prove the analysis by investigators reporting results from these studies.
Regardless of the control base selected, however, the data from Nagasaki

Thus far, after exposure periods of 4-5 yr and cumulative doses of more
than 11,000 WLM, seven dogs among the groups exposed to radon and
uranium have developed lung cancer: three bronchoalveolar cancers
(without cigarette-smoking), three epidermoid cancers (smoking status
not stated, but one evidently nonsmoking), and one fibrosarcoma of the
peripheral lung (nonsmoking). In animals of these groups that were
sacrificed after 40 mo or more, extensive adenomatosis was found at
the bronchoalveolar junction, as well as granulomas and bullous emphy-
sema.47 Three dogs have had squamous carcinomas of the nasal mucosa
(two nonsmoking and one smoking). No cancer at any site has appeared
among the smoking dogs not exposed to radon and uranium, and at 4-5 yr
pulmonary changes have been minimal in this group.
  The Hanford group has exposed hamsters and rats to radon daughters
(900 and 1,200 WL) with and without uranium-ore dust (15 mg/m3) for
5 mo, with total cumulative doses of about 10,000-12,000 WLM.14,48
Squamous metaplasia of the nasopharynx was a very common observation
in both hamsters and rats exposed to radon daughters only, and there
were a few squamous-cell cancers of the nasal epithelium. The groups ex-
posed to dust and radon daughters had changes in the deep lung, instead
of nasal mucosal metaplasia. Hamsters thus exposed had no lung neo-
plasia, but did have fibrosis, emphysema, and adenomatosis. However,
rats exposed to radon daughters and dust had a high proportion of bron-
choalveolar squamous carcinomas and occasional adenocarcinomas. It is
evident that hamsters were more resistant than rats to development of
lower respiratory tract neoplasia. Moreover, the contrast in results be-
tween those exposed and not exposed to dust indicates that radiation ex-
posure without dust was chiefly to the upper airway, presumably owing to
absorption there of the free-ion fraction of radon daughters.
  Little and colleagues have demonstrated bronchoalveolar cancer induc-
tion from polonium-210 instilled intratracheally in hamsters at mean
doses as low as 15 rads.27 A single dose of 100 nCi in 0.2 ml of saline pro-
duced tumors in fewer animals (two of 31) than a slightly lower cumulative
dose given in 15 instillations each of 5.6 nCi each (14 of 59 animals).25
A most important observation in these experiments has been that instilla-
tion of salt solution alone increased the effects of polonium instillation.
For example, if, under the same conditions of exposure, the single instilla-
tion (100 nCi) was followed by 14 weekly intratracheal instillations of 0.2
ml of normal saline, the proportion of animals with tumors was approxi-
mately the same as in the group given 15 instillations of 5.6 nCi. A num-
ber of such experiments have shown the enhancement of lung-cancer
production in hamsters from alpha-radiation exposure by this potential
stimulus to bronchial cell proliferation.28 Saline alone was as effective in

certainty a dose below which teratologic effects in man are not induced by
exposure at sensitive stages in development. As discussed above, such
thresholds do, however, probably exist, and they may be higher for pro-
tracted or fractionated radiation than for acute single exposures.19,24,138

Radionuclides Administered During Pregnancy

The effects of various radioisotopes administered to pregnant mammals
have been less extensively studied than the effects of externally ad-
ministered radiation. Furthermore, one cannot generalize on the effects of
administered radionuclides, because, depending on the chemical form and
the type and energy of the emitted radiation, they may or may not cross
the placenta, they may have specific target organs, the distribution of
radiation may be nonrandom, the metabolism of radioactive elements or
compounds may vary greatly from person to person because of individual
biologic variations or because of the disease state of a given subject, and
the change in dose rate with time may be difficult to evaluate.35
Radioisotopes administered to the mother may also affect the newborn if
they are administered shortly before birth, because many are excreted in
the breast milk.10,178
  In any event, before one can estimate the potential hazard of ad-
ministering a radioactive nuclide or compound to a pregnant woman, one
must determine with some accuracy the total dose to the fetus or a par-
ticular fetal tissue, the dose rate and how it varies with time, and the
stages of gestation during which the radiation is received.
  Until recently,151 the radioactive isotopes of iodine were the radionu-
clides most commonly used in nuclear medicine. The two most important
ones are iodine-131 and iodine-125. Although inorganic iodide readily
crosses the placenta, iodine attached to proteins, hormones, and even
radioactive rose bengal is less likely to cross. However, a significant
amount of iodine usually is released from the labeled compounds and
becomes available to the fetus. There is probably no radioactively labeled
iodine compound that does not release some iodine to the circulation after
administration.
  The human fetal thyroid does not take up iodine before the twelfth
week;32,51 thereafter, however, its uptake increases, and it comes to a peak
in the sixth month.51 In the mouse, there is some evidence that the fetal
thyroid has a greater avidity for iodine than does the maternal thyroid.82
Because the human fetal thyroid accumulates considerably more
iodine-131 per gram than do other fetal tissues, an inadvertent
therapeutic dose to the mother of 5 mCi would deliver 6,500 rads to this
organ and thereby ablate it.50 If the dose of radioactive iodine is high

the combined transporter/emplacer vehicle except
that the cask is removable from the mainframe. Alter-
nate vehicle concepts include more traditional, articu-
lated designs, with the tractor at one end and the cask
at the other. The transport and emplacement cycle
again starts, with the transporter aligning itself with
the hot-cell door. After the canister is loaded, the
driver heads for the active storage room.
  The rail-mounted emplacer gantry-~which looks
somewhat like a straddled crane-~sits astride the
intersection between the haulageway and the em-
placement room. Upon arrival at the intersection, the
transporter operator drives through the gantry, then
stops with the cask positioned such that two sets of
lifting arms can remove the cask from the transporter.
Perfect alignment of transporter and emplacer is not
necessary because the lift mechanism on the gantry
has 5 degrees of freedom, i.e., horizontal (travel),
vertical, axial, and two angular adjustments. Clearly,
these attitude-control features are also required to
align the cask with the emplacement hole.
  With the cask firmly held by the gantry lift arms,
the transporter, now without cask, moves from under
the gantry and returns to the hot cell, or waits to
accept an empty cask. The gantry, in the meantime,
travels on rails carrying the cask to the emplacement
hole where it aligns and mates the cask with the
emplacement hole-door. Once mated, the final em-
placement process, described earlier, is performed.
When final emplacement is completed, the gantry
returns to the intersection to unload the now empty
cask onto an empty transporter and accepts a loaded
cask from the next transporter.

Table 2 Some common explosives used for tunnelling in Sweden


Blast planning
It is not unusual for tunnel constructors to fail to
consider the effects of the charges in the rows
adjacent to the often well-planned smooth blasted
contour row. Charging the adjacent rows with a
heavy charge results in cracks spreading further
into the remaining rock than from the smooth
blasted row. It is better to optimize the charge
calculations such that the damage zone from any
hole in the round will not exceed the damage zone
from the contour holes. This can easily be done by
use of Fig. 2(a), where the damage zone is given
for different charge concentrations.
  Table 2 contains recommended burdens for some
Swedish explosives for use in smooth blasting. For
a hole diameter of 48 mm and 17-mm GURIT pipe
charges, a burden of 0.8 m is normal. From Fig.
2(a) we find that this charge will result in a damage
zone of about 0.3 m. Choosing a fully charged hole
of ANFO (/ = 1.6 kg/m) in the next row with a
damage zone of 1.5 m is of no value because this
results in a damage zone that extends 0.4 m further
into the rock (1.5-0.8-0.3 = 0.4 m) than the
damage zone from the GURIT charges. It would be
better to use a charge concentration that results in
a damage zone equal to that caused by the GURIT
plus the burden, i.e. 1.2 m (Fig. 5) - such a charge
should have / = 0.8-1.2 kg/m.

given by ba' = 2.303 RT/(1 ~ ~')F, with the values of ~' as
shown on the curves (~ = transfer coefficient, n = number
of electrons, and ~ = stoichiometric number).
  An important characteristic demonstrated in Figure 4 is
that the error from the linear polarization assumption is
asymmetric, i.e., greater for anodic polarization than for
cathodic or vice versa, except for the 0.5 curve (ba' =
|bc"|). The asymmetry can be very pronounced, as shown
numerically in Table 2. Listed here is the maximum value
of E ~ E~, below which the linear polarization error remains
less than 5%. The maximum ~E is seen to vary consider-
ably, from 6 to 57 mV, as the anodic Tafel slope is
changed.


  Basic information of this type can help the corrosion
engineer decide whether to select anodic or cathodic
polarization for linear polarization measurements on a given
corroding metal. That is not the only choice open, however.
There is a third technique, namely the dual electrode
technique-~an important variation of the small potential
approximation. It combines both anodic and cathodic
polarization in a single measurement. A two-electrode cell is
used, in which the electrodes are duplicate specimens of the
test metal. When a potential difference ~E is applied across
the two electrodes, each experiences a potential change of
0.5 ~E if the two are identical and ~E is small. Therefore,


to calculate corrosion current from dual-electrode measure-
ments.
  The dual electrode technique was first developed in
1963 by Marsh,10 who utilized polarity reversal of the
applied potential so that both a forward current If and a
reverse polarity current Ir were measured. The average of
these meter readings is inserted into Equation (15B) to
calculate I*. In application of this method to real corroding
metals, allowance must be made for the fact that duplicate
test electrodes seldom yield identical corrosion potentials
or corrosion currents. As Marsh showed,10 it is necessary to
determine the starting potential difference between the two
test electrodes 1 and 2, (E~~ - E~~), and to calculate the mean
current as I = 1/2 (If + Ir) when |E~~ - E~~| < |~E| and as I =
1/2 |Ir - If| when |E~~ - E~~| > |~E|.
  Marsh's reversal method has been widely applied in
engineering studies of corrosion resistant metals. In fact, in
the past decade, much more electrochemical corrosion rate
data have been generated by dual-electrode polarization
than by anodic or cathodic polarization singly.
  A simpler dual-electrode procedure, which eliminates
the polarity reversal feature of Marsh's method, was
recently reported.11 It is termed "Direct" method because
I* is calculated directly from a single current I, measured
after increasing the starting potential difference (E~~ - E~~)
by an amount ~Ede. The corrosion current is now

  Frequently the reaction of nitrogen dioxide in the liquid phase with a metal results
in the formation of an adherent film which slows down any subsequent reaction.
This is apparently not so with zinc and hence the reaction with this element has been
thoroughly examined. The alkali metals react rapidly and controllably with liquid
dinitrogen tetroxide to yield the corresponding nitrates but no nitrite.46 Zinc reacts
readily with nitrogen dioxide to give a white crystalline solid, insoluble in nitrogen
dioxide, and having the formula Zn(NO3)2,2N~O4.113 At 100~ the pure anhydrous
nitrate is formed. The kinetics of this reaction have been examined114 as has the
effect of the addition of dinitrogen trioxide or nitrosyl chloride. In the former case
no additional compounds are formed, although the rate of reaction is increased.115
With nitrosyl chloride, depending on the conditions of reaction, it is possible to
obtain the chloride or the nitrate, sometimes solvated.116
  Solutions of diethylnitrosamine in dinitrogen tetroxide behave in a mann~~ that
may be interpreted in terms of the following equilibria117:


twelve heats indicated IGSCC susceptibility after dynamic strain testing,
with an IDS value of 0.65 established for this heat treatment in this environ-
ment as the lower limit for susceptibility. The most extensive IGSCC noted
occurred in one of the 10.2-cm (4-in.) seamless pipe heats (M7616), where
IGSCC occurred even in the mill-annealed condition (Fig. 2) in this severe
environment. The mill-annealed specimen did reveal some mixed mode
cracking (intergranular plus transgranular), but crack initiation was always
intergranular. This particular heat of material was also extremely susceptible
to IGSCC in other studies [3,5] using more severe sensitization treatments.
This level of susceptibility would have been predicted by degree of sensitization
measurements using both A 262, Practice A, and the EPR technique. But,
the EPR method provides quantitative data relative to the level of sus-
ceptibility between mill-annealed and sensitized conditions (P~ = 7.3 and
40.0 C/cm2 compares to IDS = 0.69 and 0.92, respectively), while the
A 262, Practice A method shows little differentiation (40 and 50 percent
ditching). The etch structures developed after the A 262, Practice A, and
EPR exposures are shown in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3,
the extent of grain boundary ditching appears comparable for both con-
ditions; however, the EPR-produced structures (Fig. 4) clearly delineate
the difference in grain boundary attack (chromium depletion around carbide
particles) [5] between the mill-annealed and lightly sensitized condtion.
  In contrast, the A 262, Practice E, test does not appear very sensitive
at these lower degrees of sensitization. The structures developed in the
mill-annealed and sensitized specimens after three 72-h exposures are shown
in Fig. 5, where penetration depths after straining 3 to 5 percent can only
be measured with great difficulty. Based on the data developed by A 262,
Practice E, for the other eleven heats, the difference between penetration
depths of 0.2 mil for the mill-annealed condition and 0.4 to 0.8 mil after
sensitizing do not appear significant.
  The 25.4-cm (10-in.) seamless pipe heat (TH6656) revealed the lowest
level (IDS = 0.65) of IGSCC after sensitizing of the seven susceptibl~
materials; this material was not susceptible in the mill-annealed condtion.
The fracture surface for this specimen after dynamic strain testing is show`
in Fig. 6. Only one corner of the specimen revealed IGSCC; the remainde~
of the specimens failed ductilely (approximately 90 percent of the fractur~
surface reveals IGSCC in highly susceptible materials after severe sensitizatio~
treatments) [3]. This specimen also contained only a few secondary cracks,
while highly susceptible materials, such as Heat M7616, usually develo~
secondary cracking too numerous for counting.
  The etch structures produced in the sensitized Heat TH6656 specime~
during degree of sensitization measurements using the three methods ar~
shown in Fig. 7. Again, the A 262, Practice E, results are not sufficientl~
discerning to predict the IGSCC behavior. Both the A 262, Practice A, an~
EPR method reveal a sensitized microstructure, but only the EPR measure-

  Although equilibrium phase relations in this system have received
considerable geologic, experimental, and theoretical attention over the
years, many ambiguities and uncertainties in the thermodynamic proper-
ties of magnesian silicates have yet to be resolved. Owing to the high
sensitivity of calculated equilibrium temperatures and pressures to small
errors in the thermodynamic properties of minerals in the system MgO-
SiO2-H2O, relative uncertainties in the values of ~G~f and ~H~f for
these minerals must be of the order of a few tens of cal mole-1 or less
to reproduce all the various experimental observations. This require-
ment served as an implicit constraint in the retrieval calculations re-
ported below.

generated the values of ~G~f and ~H~f in table 8 for the minerals ap-

Introduction

  Scanning electron microscope observations of the surface of the reacted wafers from experiments DB7
and DB8 indicated that the secondary minerals present were large enough to be plucked from the surface
of the wafer for more detailed characterization. This was performed by using a binocular microscope and a
dissecting needle dabbed with alcohol. One crystal mass was mounted on the end of a glass fiber and
prepared for XRD analysis using a Gandolfi camera. Many other crystal masses were plucked from the
surface of the wafer and used to prepare an epoxy grain mount. The crystals were confined within a
stainless steel nut that was floated in the partially set epoxy. By carefully polishing the grain mount, we
were able to remove the overlying epoxy and expose the crystals at the surface. This polished grain mount
was suitable for quantitative analyses using WDS techniques on the EMP.
  The dominant secondary mineral formed as a result of the hydrothermal interaction of this densely
welded, devitrified ashflow tuff (compositionally a high-silica rhyolite) with a dilute (Na + HCO3)
ground water at 250~C was the rare zeolite dachiardite. Dachiardite is a mordenite-group, high-silica
zeolite with a cation content similar to that of mordenite, with which it is commonly associated (Wise and
Tschernich, 1978). The type locality for dachiardite is a hydrothermally altered zone in a pegmatite near
San Piero di Campo, Elba, Italy (Bonardi, 1979). Its generalized compositon is given as

However, these equilibria are not equally reducible by the
hydrogen ion equilibrium as shown in Figure 14; and only
the iron appears to be significantly oxidized with nickel
being sparingly so. This trend suggests that increasing nickel
would inhibit caustic cracking, which it does. Chromium
forms a soluble species (CrO~~~) but more sparingly than
either nickel or iron at the same pH.
  1. Environmental Factors. Siderov and Ryabchenkov
investigated the effect of NaOH concentration on the
cracking of Type 310 at 330 C and obtained the results of
Figure 76 showing that the concentration of NaOH below
which cracking would not occur is about 0.1 to 1%.152
Cracks were intergranular and transgranular with the latter
predominating. Picket et al investigated the cracking of
Type 304 and found similar trends.47 Snowden156 used
Type 347 to investigate the effects of concentration, stress,
temperature and the composition of NaOH with KOH. His
results are summarized in Table 20. In general, NaOH
appears to be about twice as aggressive as KOH. This same
trend was noted by Coriou and Grall.157 The concen-
tration dependence of Snowden's work appears to agree
with that of Sidorov and Ryabchenkov. The cracking of all
specimens showed no prior susceptibility to sensitization.
Snowden also investigated the effect of dewpoint and
superheat environments on the cracking of contaminated
Type 347 in a temperature range of 275-350 C. The
contamination was applied by immersing specimens in a
30% solution. The most significant finding of these experi-
ments was the shifting in mode of cracking. Contrary to the
results of solution tests described in Table 20, the cracking
for the NaOH contaminated solutions was predominantly
transgranular. Specimens contaminated with KOH cracked
intergranularly below 380 C (the melting point of KOH)
and transgranularly above. Figure 77 shows typical inter-
granular and transgranular cracks from the work of
Snowden.
  Wheeler and Howells155 investigated the effect of
NaOH concentration on the cracking of Type 347 in liquid
sodium and water environments at 360-450 C. Oxygen was
purposely excluded. Their results are shown in Table 21.
Cracking in very high caustic concentrations at 399 C and
362 C appears to be stifled; whereas cracking was observed


when the concentration reaches 100%. All cracking in this
study was transgranular.
  The effect of LiOH on the cracking of Type 347 was
studied by Pement using cold formed bellows
specimens.153 Concentrations were varied from 10-4 to 5
molar and specimens were tested at 160, 289, and 315 C.
Oxygen was purposely excluded from the experiments.
Cracking occurred at all three temperatures; an 0.1 molar
concentration appeared to be the approximate division for
susceptibility with only one crack observed at this concen-
tration. Intergranular cracking was observed in all cases.
Pement states that the cracking in LiOH solutions was less
aggressive than in NaOH solutions; and he suggests that this
may result from the lower ionization and lower solubility
of the LiOH.
  The effect of additions to caustic solutions has been
investigated. Siderov and Ryabchenkov studied the effect
of NaCl additions to a 3% NaOH solution at 330 C and
found that the cracking was progressively inhibited as the
concentration increased according to the trend in Figure
78.152 Gulyaev et al154 investigated the effect of air,
nitrogen, and argon additions on cracking in NaOH
solutions and found that these additions inhibited cracking.
However, the mechanism for their effect is not clear.
  Wheeler and Howells investigated the effect of phos-
phate addition to NaOH + KOH solutions and found that
an Na3PO4/(NaOH + KOH) ratio of 1:4 was sufficient to
prevent cracking.155 Their well known data are shown in
Figure 79.

Figures 2.8 and 2.9 show several micrographs
of the alteration layers formed in a 143 day
MCC-1 type interactional test with the RCM
material. The layers have a high degree of
precipitate deposition and show an increased
level of pitting of the bulk glass as de-
scribed in section 2.1. Well formed star-
like~crystals were formed on the alteration
layer, which have XRD and EDXS spectra simi-
lar to alpha-Fe2O3 (meghemite or magnetite).
The Fe-Si reactions occurring in this system
accelerate the leaching process, but the
solution concentrations of the waste elements
are significantly lower than in control ex-
periments with only the glass present. This
is due to the high concentration of colloids


One approach to the chemical modeling of a
disordered phase is to treat it numerically
as a mixture of discrete component phases,
with individual stabilities. The advantage
of this procedure is that each such component
phase can be treated in simulation as a dis-
solved solid with a stability that can be re-
lated to an equilibrium aqueous composition.

The methodology of Tardy and Garrels (1974)
is a well-known procedure for the estimation
of the stabilities of layer silicates that
may be applicable to the less ordered prod-
ucts of glass dissolution. They showed that
for the layer silicate structure, the compo-
nent oxides make constant contributions to
the total free energy of the phase. It was
possible to make estimates of their stabil-
ities that were consistent not only with
those of composite phases, but with solubil-
ity data, i.e., the activities of dissolved
species in equilibrated leachates. The free
energies of formation of simple oxides as
"silicated" components that were determined
in this way are in many cases very different
from their standard state values, reflecting
their degree of bonding. Once determined,
however, they could simply be added and sub-
tracted to construct other complex phases of
similar structures but different stoichio-
metries and previously unknown stabilities.

The concept can be extended to the alteration
products of specific glass compositions at
constant temperature if there is sufficient
regularity in the structures that are formed.

In the present application, we do not exactly
duplicate the Tardy-Garrels approach, since
there is not a comparable set of alteration
product phases known to be of similar struc-
ture and with known thermochemical proper-
ties. For our purposes, this set must
be generated from the reference glass
composition.

The most direct approach is to measure ex-
perimentally the concentrations of dissolved
species. As they approach steady state, the
free energies of reaction computed from the
activity products also become constant. If
the solid composition is also known, the
overall reaction can be written, and the
value of the composite solid phase free
energy computed. It may also be possible
to estimate the stabilities for silicated
components that are otherwise difficult to
determine by constructing plots of free
energy of silication versus element
electronegativity.


nepheline-glass phase and the observed prod-
ucts conform to expected silica-alumina aque-
ous reaction behavior, with the titanate and
zirconate phases showing little reaction.

Samples of the Rockwell RSC-S29 ceramic
forms were sealed in gold capsules with
various water compositions (deionized, con-
nate, NBT-6a Brine) and heated to 200, 300,
and 400~C for 7 days (White 1982; Freeborn
and White 1984). The reaction products and
solution concentrations were determined. The
general results indicated that the hydrother-
mal conditions accelerated the dissolution
of the nepheline and trace hauyne phase and
caused some corrosion of the perovskite
phase. None of the studies indicated any
dissolution on the primary actinide hosts
phases zirconolite, magnetoplumbite, and
murataite. Of the radionuclide simulants,
Cs, Sr, La, Ce, U, and Th, in the ceramic
form only U and Cs were found in measurable
quantities in solution. The observed solu-
tion concentrations in the 7 day tests are
listed in Tables C.7, C.8, and C.9. Note
that the blank values for the elements have
not been subtracted.

Reaction products were observable in the
various tests by XRD and SEM/EDXS. The re-
sults are summarized in Table C.10. In the
deionized water tests at 200~C small crystals
of a wairakite-type phase were observed and
some clay-like material. At 300~C the crys-
tallization reactions were enhanced and well-
formed crystals of analcime, containing Cs,
were observed. In addition there was a phase
with micaceous habit composed of Ca, Al, and
Si. The EDXS analysis indicates the phases
to be of the anorthite or margarite type.
At 400~C the only identified product was a
plagioclase feldspar, formed from the decom-
position of the analcime phase. There were
also very small crystallites present, possi-
ble a sphene phase, CaTiSiO5. The solution

12.7.2 Soluble Fission Products

  The fission products that form solid solutions with the
heavy-metal oxides include yttrium, the rare earths, the
portion of the zirconium not contained in the alkaline earth
oxide phase as zirconates, niobium, and the fraction of the
molybdenum present as oxide. The last three are tetravalent
ions that form oxides of the general formula MO2, which
has the same fluorite structure as the actinide oxides.
Although the stable crystallographic form of yttrium and
the rare earths in their pure state is the sesquioxide M2O3,
they assume the fluorite structure of the host lattice when
dissolved in UO2. Figure 12.8 shows that the difference in

or, using Eq. 16.94,


Equation 16.97 represents Nabarro-~Herring diffusional
creep (Eq. 16.27). The observed linear stress dependence is
also exhibited by Coble's grain-boundary creep formula
(Eq. 16.47) or Gifkins' grain-boundary sliding model
(Eq. 16.95), but the grain-size dependence of the latter two
mechanisms are d-3 and d-1, respectively. Beyond the
transition stress, ~tr, the creep rate becomes independent of
grain size and increases as the 4th or 5th power of the
applied stress. These features of the creep rate are con-
sistent with the dislocation climb-~annihilation model of
creep (Sec. 16.7).
  In principle, the total creep rate should be expressed as
the sum of ~diff and ~dc, but the difference in the
exponents of the stress in the two models is so large that
the transition region where both modes contribute more or
less equally to the total creep rate is quite narrow. It is
sufficient to assume that the transition occurs dis-
continuously at a stress ~tr. Assuming that the activation
energy for creep is the same for both the high- and
low-stress mechanism, Eqs. 16.97 and 16.98 can be equated
at ~tr

  The importance of the redistribution process should be self-evident, as it
determines the amount of water retained at various times by the different
depth zones in the soil profile and hence can affect the water economy of
plants. The rate and duration of downward flow during redistribution deter-
mine the effective soil water storage, a property that is vitally important,
particularly in relatively dry regions, where water supply is infrequent and
plants must rely for long periods on the unreplenished reservoir of water
within the rooting zone. Even in relatively humid regions, where the water
supply by precipitation would seem to be sufficient, inadequate soil moisture
storage can deprive the crops to be grown of a major portion of the water
supply and can cause crop failure. Finally, the redistribution process is
important because it often determines how much water will flow through the
root zone (rather than be detained, or temporarily stored, within it) and
hence how much leaching of solutes will take place.
  As we shall explain more fully in the sections to follow, soil-water storage
is generally not a fixed quantity or a static property but a dynamic phe-
nomenon, determined by the time-variable rates of soil-water inflow to, and
outflow from, the relevant soil volume.

B. Internal Drainage in Thoroughly Wetted Profiles

  We have already made a distinction between the postinfiltration movement
of soil water in cases where a groundwater table is present fairly close to the
soil surface (i.e., at a depth not exceeding a few meters) and in cases where
groundwater is either nonexistent or too deep to affect the state and move-
ment of soil moisture in the root zone.
  At the groundwater table, also called the phreatic surface, soil water is at
atmospheric pressure. Beneath this level the hydrostatic pressure exceeds
atmospheric pressure, while above this level soil water is under suction.
Internal drainage in the presence of a water table tends to a state of equilib-
rium, in which the suction at each point corresponds to its height above the
free water level. The downward drainage flux decreases as the hydraulic
gradient decreases, both approaching zero in time (provided, of course, there
is no further addition of water by another episode of infiltration, or abstrac-
tion of water by evapotranspiration-~processes which would prevent the
attainment of static equilibrium). At equilibrium, if attainable, soil wetness
would increase in depth to a value of saturation just above the water table, a
depth distribution which would mirror the soil moisture characteristic curve.
Phenomena involving falling water tables and groundwater drainage will be
treated in our next chapter.
  In the present section, we wish to concentrate upon the internal drainage
of profiles initially wetted to near saturation throughout their depth. We

  Common practice in irrigation is to measure the total water content of
the root zone just prior to an irrigation, and to supply the amount of water
necessary to replenish the soil reservoir to some maximal water content,
generally taken to be the "field capacity." Some ecologists and irrigationists
have tended to assume that the deficit of soil moisture which develops
between rains or irrigations is due to evapotranspiration only, thus dis-
regarding the amount of water which may flow through the bottom of the
root zone, either downward or upward. This flow is not always negligible
and often constitutes a tenth or more of the total water balance (Robins
et al., 1954; Nixon and Lawless, 1960; Rose and Stern, 1967a, b).
  It should be obvious that measurement of root-zone or subsoil water
content by itself cannot tell us the rate and direction of soil-water movement
(van Bavel et al., 1968a, b). Even if the water content at a given depth
remains constant, we cannot conclude that the water there is immobile,
since it might be moving steadily through that depth. Tensiometric mea-
surements can, however, indicate the directions and magnitudes of the
hydraulic gradients through the profile (Richards, 1965) and allow us to
compute the fluxes from knowledge of the hydraulic conductivity versus
suction or wetness for the particular soil. More direct measurements of the
deep percolation component of the field water balance may eventually
become possible with the development of water flux meters (Cary, 1968).
Such devices have not yet proven to be practical, however.
  The most direct method for measurement of the field water balance is
by use of lysimeters (van Bavel and Myers, 1962; Pruitt and Angus, 1960;
King et al., 1956; Pelton, 1961; McIlroy and Angus, 1963; Forsgate et al.,
1965; Rose et al., 1966; Harrold, 1966; Black et al., 1968; Hillel et al.,
1969). These are generally large containers of soil, set in the field to repre-
sent the prevailing soil and climatic conditions and allowing more accurate
measurement of physical processes than can be carried out in the open
field. From the standpoint of the field water balance, the most efficient
lysimeters are those equipped with a weighing device and a drainage system,
which together allow continuous measurement of both evapotranspiration
and percolation. Lysimeters may not provide a reliable measurement of
the field water balance, however, when the soil or above-ground conditions
of the lysimeter differ markedly from those of the field itself.

D. Radiation Exchange in the Field

  By radiation we refer to the emission of energy in the form of electro-
magnetic waves from all bodies above 0~K. Solar (sun) radiation received
on the earth's surface is the major component of its energy balance. Green

complex interplay of rates of biological uptake and loss, together with radioactive decay in the
many organs and tissues that might determine an ALI, and it would be prudent to consider
carefully each separate case. In fact, relevant data are scarce but the following examples will
serve to illustrate the nature of the problem.
  From considerations of water balance, the mean life of water in the body is about 14 days
for adults and 6 days for infants aged 6 months (ICRP, 1975) and that of the long-lived
radionuclide tritium in the form of tritiated water will have similar values. In consequence, the
committed dose equivalent to body tissues from unit intake of tritium as tritiated water will be
only about four times greater for such infants than for adults, rather than the ten times greater
factor derived above that would be expected on the basis of their differences in mass alone.
Similarly, as a consequence of the more rapid turnover of the long-lived caesium-137 in people
of smaller mass (Cryer and Baverstock, 1972), the committed dose equivalent in body tissues
from unit intake of the radionuclide is only about 1.5 times greater for the 6-month infant than it
is for adults (Medical Research Council, 1975).
  The mean life of iodine in the thyroid also increases with age, but this may be accompanied by
a small decrease in the uptake into the gland from the blood, (Medical Research Council, 1975;
UNSCEAR, 1977; Dunning and Schwarz, 1981; Stather and Greenhalgh, 1983). For the
relatively short-lived radionuclide iodine-131, differences in biological turnover are of little
consequence because its rate of loss from the thyroid is dominated by radioactive decay and its
mean life in that organ is therefore about the same at all ages. In consequence, the committed
dose equivalent to the thyroid per unit intake of iodine-131 is about ten times greater for the
infant aged 6 months than it is for adults (Medical Research Council, 1975), reflecting their
approximately 10-fold difference in thyroid mass. However, for the very long-lived iodine-129,
the more rapid biological turnover in young people tends to offset their smaller mass, and the
committed dose equivalent to the thyroid per unit intake of iodine-129 for the 6-month child is
only about twice that for adults (UNSCEAR, 1977).
  Papworth and Vennart (1973) and Leggett et al. (1982) have described how the uptake of
strontium into bone and its retention therein varies with age. The former authors have given
values for the committed dose equivalent in red bone marrow and on bone surfaces from unit
intake of dietary strontium-90 and strontium-89. For the long-lived strontium-90, the value for
a 6-month infant is about five times the adult value, but for the much shorter-lived strontium-89
the corresponding ratio lies in the range 20-40, the actual value depending on the model used for
the dosimetry of the radionuclide in bone. There may be additional contributions to the
committed effective dose equivalent from other organs and tissues for which the factors might be
different.

Chemical Form

  Values of ALI given in ICRP Publication 30 are usually appropriate to those chemical
compounds of a radionuclide that are most likely to be encountered at a place of work.
Compounds of the same radionuclide found in the environment or in food may be metabolized
differently. The consequent changes in values of committed effective dose equivalent have to be
considered very carefully. For example, increased absorption of a radionuclide from the
gastrointestinal tract into the blood will decrease the committed dose equivalent to the lower
part of the tract, but increase the doses in other tissues of the body; such increases are most
marked when radioactive decay is small during the time taken for transfer from the
gastrointestinal system to the other organs and tissues.
  It is known that absorption of some elements from the gastrointestinal system is increased in
new-born animals of several species by factors up to 100 for compounds that are very poorly

isolated in their areal distribution to pluglike bodies with somewhat
variable margins and diameters. Internally, domes tend to be
structurally more complex (in places almost "homogenized"), but not on
their tops and borders, where extensive dissolution has generally
occurred. Also, adjacent strata penetrated by domes tend to be faulted
and folded in a complex manner, making their physical continuity and
effects on water flow more difficult to characterize. This makes the
prediction of radionuclide transport less certain. Fluid inclusions in
domal salt tend to be smaller and lower in total volume than those in
bedded salt that has not been subjected to as much pressure and
compactive force. However, because of the very high thermal
conductivity of salt, heat from depth is focused upward through salt
domes. Thus, temperatures are generally higher in the upper parts of
buried domes, and water contents are much lower relative to bedded salts
and other rocks at similar depths. Up-warped and faulted sedimentary
strata on the margins and tops of salt domes are especially attractive
for oil and gas exploration, and their hydrology is more complicated and
uncertain. Domes are also attractive as a source of nearly pure rock
salt, as sites of deposits of elemental sulfur formed by reduction of
calcium sulfate on the dome margins, and as sites for underground
excavations for storing oil, gas, and other fluids.
  Domes are limited in number and easy to locate, making them more
likely targets for future human intrusion. Because they penetrate
various water-yielding sedimentary rocks to great depths, they are
subject to dissolution near their margins and may be surrounded by both
potable water at shallow depths and more mineralized groundwater at
greater depths. Their locations near the Gulf Coast are favorable in
that any minor amounts of radionuclides transported in highly saline
groundwater must be greatly diluted at shallow levels before becoming
potable or will be discharged directly into the sea for ultimate
dilution. Despite the dynamic piercement origin of salt domes, various
lines of evidence document their present structural stability.
Long-term future changes in sea level may alter details of groundwater
flow systems operating in enclosing coastal plain aquifers by increasing
or decreasing path lengths and water velocities, but the consequences of
such possible changes can be adequately bounded.

		7.4.3. Granitoids*

Granitoids and similar crystalline igneous and metamorphic rocks are the
most abundant rocks of the earth's subareal upper crust. True granites
constitute only a small percentage of the physically similar rocks
included here as granitoids. Granitoids underlie much of the United
States near the surface and at shallow depths, especially in
tectonically stable areas and in the cores of many mountain ranges.

  Equations (6) and (10) are approximate. In the next section, their validity is checked
by using them both on simulated outflow data for which D(~) is known, and on actual

flow data of Gupta et al. (1974). The present method is as accurate as that of Gupta

overestimate is to be expected. When ~L is close to ~t, D is almost constant and
Doering's (1975) equation applies, i.e. D = 4L2Q/~2(~~ - ~f). This equation can be
differentiated to give D = dQ/d~~.4L2/~2, which is identical with equation (6), except
that the coefficient 4/~2 replaces ~~~, the difference between the two being about 25%.

INTRODUCTION
  A igning ages to late Cenozoic conti-
nent~~ sedimentary deposits by correlating
their deposition with marine isotopic rec-
ords of global ice volume requires an as-
sumption that the largest fluctuations in
middle-latitude hydrologic regimes were re-
lated to and in phase with the growth and
waning of high-latitude ice sheets. Evi-
dence from a long record of lake fluctua-
tions in a closed basin east of the southern
Sierra Nevada suggests that this assump-
tion is invalid and that the largest shifts in
hydrologic regimes were caused by other


phenomena that produced changes every
several hundred thousand years. Those
data also show that although some regimes
allowed lake levels to fluctuate, with cycle
lengths having periodicities like those that
characterized high-latitude ice-sheet histo-
ries, suggesting that middle-latitude cli-
matic cycles were produced by them, other
regimes were inherently so wet or dry that
those climatic cycles produced no variation
in lake sedimentation, suggesting that the
magnitudes of extreme regimes exceeded
those of the shorter cycles. Some of the

INTRODUCTION

  The mathematical analysis of mass transport in groundwa-
ter systems has been an accepted technique for more than 10
years. In almost every case the dispersion-convection equation
forms the theoretical basis for a wide variety of predictive
mathematical models.
  Conventional practice in the application of the models in-
variably involves a simple scaling-up of the porous medium
dispersivity value from the very small values observed in col-
umn experiments to the much larger values calculated from
field trials. There is increasing evidence to suggest that the use
of large dispersivity values associated with uniform hydraulic
conductivity fields is an inappropriate basis for describing
transport in geological systems. The main issue is that mod-
eling large-scale dispersion as a diffusion phenomenon is an
unsubstantiated approximation to what is a different and
more complex phenomenon.
  Stallman [1972] considered this deficiency of the transport
theory to be one of the most important limitations in the pre-
dictive evaluation of field problems. Gillham et al. [1975]
pointed out the problem of defining a unique dispersivity be-
cause the value commonly increases with distance from a
point source as the transported mass encounters successively
larger scales of heterogeneity. In addition to these essentially
philosophical arguments there are demonstrated cases where
the diffusion model can be shown to be inadequate. For ex-
ample, Simpson [1978] used a set of simple experiments to il-
lustrate how the use of a large dispersivity value will cause the
upstream migration of a tracer from a source to be over-
estimated. Using a theoretical approach, Schwartz [1977] ex-
plained how the dispersivity coefficient is not uniquely de-
fined and could not be considered as a characteristic
parameter for some porous media. All these arguments, how-
ever, are equivocal and do not clearly indicate the nature of


the problems resulting from extending the diffusion-based
model of dispersion to large systems.
  The classical statistical model of microscopic dispersion
considers the position of individual tracer particles in a flow
field to be determined by the ever changing velocity field at
the microscopic scale. Because individual particles of the en-
semble moving through the medium follow different paths,
each encounters slightly different flow conditions [Bear, 1972].
On the basis of the central limit theorem it can be shown that
if the travel time for an individual tracer particle becomes
much larger than the time interval during which its successive
velocities are still correlated, then the probability distribution
of its total displacement should be normal [Bear, 1972]. Appli-
cation of the ergodic principle allows it to be concluded that
the spatial distribution of the ensemble will also be normal.
  It is this tendency for the cloud of tracer particles to con-
verge to a normal distribution and to spread with a variance
that is proportional to time that makes it possible to model
mass transport as a diffusional process.
  One purpose of this paper is to describe a stochastic mod-
eling concept that casts macroscopic dispersion as a process
related to the spatial heterogeneity in hydraulic conductivity.
This model represents a realistic analog of the actual process
and does not require the use of large dispersivity values to
generate macroscopic dispersion. Thus limitations which may
be inherent in the conventional treatment are overcome. The
stochastic approach takes account of the spatial variability of
the flow parameters and the inability to describe a hetero-
geneous conductivity distribution exactly. Model output is in
the form of probability distributions which reflect the uncer-
tainty inherent in prediction.
  The use of large dispersivity values to model geological sys-
tems implicitly assumes that the microscopic theories apply to
larger systems. A second objective of this paper is to test this
assumption and determine whether the commonly accepted
equivalence between column-scale and field-scale transport is

  Trace elements in 9 samples of the Stirling Quartzite
are given in table 7. Trace elements in the quartzite
and shale facies are like those in the conglomerate and
shale, respectively, of the Johnnie Formation (table 6).
The quartzite differs from that of the Kingston Peak(?)

less copper, barium, and strontium. The quartz veins
in the Stirling contain trace elements only in small
amounts compared to the parent quartzite.
  In the Death Valley area the Stirling Quartzite has
a maximum thickness of about 2,000 feet. At the type
locality in the Spring Mountains (Nolan, 1929, p. 463)
it is 3,700 feet thick. The boundaries of the formation,

seems apparent that the Precambrian sedimentary rock
units and the Tertiary rocks have not yet been fully identi-
fied and described. In addition, the detailed physical strati-
graphy and facies relationships in the Upper Ordovician,
Silurian, Late Devonian (Frasnian especially), and, to a
lesser extent, the Late Mississippian through Permian
sequences, are poorly known. The most important ad-
vances in Great Basin stratigraphy, however, may be ex-
pected from biostratigraphic study. Most of the fossils
found in the Great Basin have not yet been described or
figured and, although progress has been made, satisfactory
biostratigraphic zonation cannot be established without
adequate systematic description of the fossils involved.

  Members of the Eastern Nevada Geological Society,
led by E. H. Phelps, in about 1960 began thinking of com-
piling a new correlation chart for the Great Basin Area as
a "ten year" progress report following their original chart
of 1953 (Easton, 1953). Early in 1961, a committee of
geologists working in the Great Basin was organized for this
purpose under the chairmanship of J. C. Osmond. Subse-
quently, in September, 1961, Osmond was succeeded by
E. H. Phelps and, finally, R. L. Langenheim assumed res-
ponsibility in January, 1962. In 1969 E. R. Larson assumed
the responsibility for the final phases of publication. Ten
others, serving as committee members during all or part
of the time during which the chart was in preparation, have
compiled data for one or more localities treated in the
chart. These men are D. H. Adair, J. P. Albers, D. M. Blue,
W. H. Easton, E. R. Larson, V. E. McMath, D. C. Noble,
A. F. Sanborn, J. H. Stewart, and B. W. Troxell. R. J.
Roberts also served as a committee member, contributing
much personal data and knowledge and also arranging for
assistance by many U. S. Geological Survey personnel work-
ing in the area. In addition to the committee members,
specialists were asked to review correlations for rocks of
specific ages or to review treatment of areas in which they
had significant experience. Cambrian correlations were ex-
tensively criticized and evaluated by A. R. Palmer; R. J.
Ross checked the Ordovician presentation; A. J. Boucot of-
fered comments on Silurian correlations; R. H. Waines thor-
oughly revised and amplified coverage of Devonian rocks;
and N. J. Silberling provided much information on the
Triassic System. Others offering critical assistance, chiefly
in regard to areas of which they have detailed knowledge,
include H. L. Bauer, D. A. Brew, R. L. Christiansen,

logically and petrographically from members of the Paint-
brush Tuff, as now defined, and is more closely related in
its petrography to the intracaldera tuffs and rhyolites of
Area 20. The xenolithic inclusions of intracaldera Grouse
Canyon and the areal distribution of the Stockade Wash
indicate a source within the Silent Canyon caldera. The
total erupted volume of the Stockade Wash was about
20-40 km3 (5-10 mi3). Recurrent minor subsidences
probably occurred within Silent Canyon caldera as the
thick sequence of tuffs and rhyolites of Area 20
accumulated inside the caldera, with the result that the
underlying Crater Flat Tuff was eventually downdropped
more than 2 km (diagram 2, fig. 26).

  The members of the Paintbrush Tuff and petro-
logically related alkali-calcic lavas were erupted from the
Claim Canyon cauldron (diagram 3, fig. 26) resulting in a
caldera of unknown extent. Only a small segment of the
Claim Canyon cauldron is now exposed, but the general
size and location of the collapse structure can be inferred,
from distribution of tuffs and lavas north and south of
Timber Mountain caldera, to be about 25 km (15 mi) in
diameter and to be centered several kilometres west of the
present summit of Timber Mountain. The oldest member
of the Paintbrush Tuff, the Topopah Spring, was erupted
about 13 m.y. ago with a total volume of about 250 km3 (60
mi3). Recurrent subsidence within the cauldron followed
eruption of the Topopah Spring Member of the Paint-
brush Tuff, and probably a minor collapse followed the
eruption of the Pah Canyon and Yucca Mountain
Members. Within the caldera they accumulated to several
times their thickness outside the caldera. The Tiva
Canyon Member, representing the climactic eruption in
the evolution of the Claim Canyon cauldron, flowed out
about 12.5 m.y. ago mainly to the west of the Claim
Canyon cauldron. The tuff of Chocolate Mountain, which
is about 1,000 m (3,300 ft) thick, was erupted as a late
quartz latitic phase of the Tiva Canyon and was confined
within the Claim Canyon cauldron, suggesting that
collapse was occurring during its eruption, although
Christiansen and others (1976) infer a collapse to the west
of the site of Oasis Valley. Tuff breccia, similar petro-
graphically to the Tiva Canyon, was generated at vents
along or near the wall of the Claim Canyon cauldron
segment. The volume of the Tiva Canyon, including the
intracauldron tuff of Chocolate Mountain, may have
totaled as much as 1,000 km3 (250 mi3). The youngest
separate cooling unit of the Paintbrush, the tuff of Pinyon
Pass, followed very soon after the Tiva Canyon was
confined to the newly formed caldera.

  After eruption of the ash-flow sheets of the Paintbrush
Tuff and after the formation of the caldera, intricate
faulting occurred within the Paintbrush cauldron, similar
to that on Timber Mountain. The fault pattern is inter-
preted by the present authors (see also Christiansen and


others, 1976) as owing to magmatic resurgence with uplift
of the cauldron block from its former subsided position
(diagram 4, fig. 26). The entire Paintbrush cauldron later
participated in a broad magmatic doming  preliminary to
the culminating stages of volcanism-~the eruption of ash-
flow sheets of the Timber Mountain Tuff. Quartz-bearing
pre-Rainier Mesa rhyolite lavas were extruded from
fractures probably related to this broad doming (diagram
5, fig. 26). Gas-charged silicic rhyolitic magma
accumulated at the top of the domical chamber, and tuffs
were assimilated from the roof as crystallization proceeded
lower in the chamber.
  The Timber Mountain Tuff chapter of the caldera
complex began 11.3 m.y. ago with eruption of the
voluminous Rainier Mesa Member from the central part of
the broad dome that had formed over the magma chamber.
The domed roof over the magma chamber ruptured
sufficiently to cause a considerable reduction of pressure
and to trigger vesiculation which greatly increased the
volume of the gas-charged magma escaping through
fissures. As the eruption proceeded, collapse of the roof
occurred, and the Rainier Mesa accumulated to a greater
thickness inside the subsidence area than outside (diagram
6, fig. 26). As the caldera deepened with continuing
eruption a more crystal-rich, but less gas-charged, quartz
latitic magma was tapped, whose eruptions were largely
confined within the caldera. Poorly sorted debris flows
containing large blocks of welded tuff and lava slid off the
newly formed oversteepened caldera walls and inter-
tongued with the upper quartz latitic part of the Rainier
Mesa Member. A total volume of about 1,200 km3 (300 mi3)
of tuff had been extruded by this time, and a large volcano-
tectonic depression formed, including the Timber
Mountain caldera and probably the adjacent Oasis Valley
caldera segment. There is little evidence to indicate
whether or not there was central resurgent doming of the
Rainier Mesa Member within this depression, except for
the westward-tilted block in the Transvaal Hills west of
Timber Mountain caldera.

  During the brief interval between the eruptions of the
Rainier Mesa Member and Ammonia Tanks Members of
the Timber Mountain Tuff (11.3-11.1 m.y.), pre-
Ammonia Tanks rhyolite lavas were extruded within the
caldera that had resulted from the Rainier Mesa eruptions
(diagram 7, fig. 26).

  The Ammonia Tanks Member of the Timber Mountain
Tuff was erupted 11.1 m.y. ago. Nearly half its total
volume of 900 km3 (230 mi3) probably accumulated within
a concomitantly subsiding caldera, as evidenced by the fact
that no debris flows or breccias are known to intertongue
with the tuff. This episode of cauldron subsidence of
Timber Mountain caldera occurred within an area some-
what smaller than the Rainier Mesa collapse area
(diagram 7, fig. 26) and was centered farther south, with
Figure 36. Packer-injection test 27, depth interval from 1,689 to 1,735 meters.

not distinctly shown on the Variable Den-
sity/Signature Logs even when the casing signal is
weak, it signifies a poor bond between cement and for-
mation. The high acoustic attenuation may also be
caused by formations like soft shales, unconsolidated
gas sands, etc. The eccentered tool or the presence of
gas in mud would also result in weak formation signal
amplitudes.
  Presence of even a very small gap between the cas-
ing and cement may erroneously indicate a poor ce-
ment bond on the compressional wave amplitude
curve. Such a microannulus or microseparation is
caused by one or more factors, such as holding
pressure in the casing after cementation, thermal ex-
pansion of the pipe during cement setting, thermal
contraction due to circulation of cooler fluids before
running the ACBL, and oil/grease on the external sur-
face of the casing. Such a condition may be suspected
when both casing as well as formation signals are
moderately high. By the application of pressure during
measurement, the ACBL may be repeated over zones
of interest to confirm the presence of the micro-
annulus. If a significant reduction in the casing signal
amplitude is observed, the entire log should be run
under pressure, because a microannulus usually pro-
vides a hydraulic seal, preventing fluid movement.

SUMMARY

  The Dresser Atlas Borehole Compensated
Acoustilog~~ is designed to record ~tc, the specific com-
pressional wave travel time in formations. The
measurements are unaffected by the borehole and
have excellent vertical definition. In clean and con-
solidated formations, the linear time-average relation-
ship yields realistic porosity values. In uncompacted
formations, Wyllie's formula provides abnormally
high values of porosity, which necessitates application
of corrections for lack of compaction. Presence of
shale and/or hydrocarbons also tends to increase
specific acoustic times, and must be corrected. Porosi-
ty derived from acoustic measurements in fractured or
vuggy carbonates is too low, reflecting only the
homogeneous porosity. By combining data from the
Density and Neutron Logs, the BHC Acoustilog can
be used for the determination of lithology and the esti-
mation of secondary porosity in carbonate rocks. The
Acoustilog is very helpful in correlation of strata and
seismic interpretation. Abnormal formation pressures
can be predicted by a study of ~t in shales.
  Acoustic logging systems for measurements other
than ~t are available. Shear wave travel times provide
the basis for determining rock mechanical properties.
Problems of sand production and fracturability of
formations can be studied. Acoustic amplitude logs
are used in open holes for fracture identification and


  The heat flow, normally measured in the upper 1% of the crust, pro-
vides only a boundary condition from which we should like to determine
the thermal regime of the crust, i.e., to determine q(z) throughout the
entire crust. This requires a knowledge of how the terms on the right
side of (3) vary throughout the crust. To provide meaningful constraints
on these terms we must obtain insight into the physical processes that
they represent. Interpretations of the crustal regime generally repre-
sent attempts to integrate (3) with simplifications believed to be
appropriate for specific regions.
  In our discussion, A will represent heat generated by radioactive
decay of U, Th, and 40K, elements present in minute amounts in crustal
rocks. The process goes on steadily, irrespective of what else might be
happening in the earth. The second term on the right in (3) represents
effects of relative vertical movement of crustal (and upper mantle)
masses; they may be solid blocks moving along faults or magmatic and
aqueous fluids generally moving through fractures created by faulting or
through pore spaces. As these movements are generally intermittent or
short-lived, they generate transient disturbances represented by the
last term in (3). Surface indicators of these mass movements are earth-
quakes, young volcanic rocks, and hot springs, which are shown with the
heat flow distribution in Figures 3, 7, and 8. These manifestations are
generally concentrated in the western regions of anomalously high heat
flow, suggesting that the anomalies there are due primarily to convec-
tion and associated transients (i.e., to effects of the last two terms
in (3)). The manifestations are rare in regions of low heat flow in the
Sierra Nevada and the eastern half of the United States, and the crustal

ASSESSING PALEOENVIRONMENTAL
RECONSTRUCTIONS

  Packrat-midden analysis affords a high-resolution view
of the environmental history of the Nevada Test Site and
vicinity. However, potential errors and unknown vari-
ables that exist should be considered. Errors could be
introduced in estimating modern climates at the fossil
sites, in reconstructing past vegetation, or in extrapolat-
ing climatic parameters from reconstructions. Retrodictive
studies, such as this one, describe phenomena that no
longer exist; conclusions derived from such analyses
cannot be tested through observation. However, they
can be tested by attempts to replicate the fossil record
and by application of proposed paleoclimatic parameters
to models of physical systems, such as pluvial lakes and
cryogenic deposits.

ACCURACY OF REPRESENTATION AND
GENERAL ANALOGS

  Plant-macrofossil assemblages from ancient packrat
middens possess distinctive characteristics that permit
identification of specific vegetation types. Analyses of
modern middens in this study, and those performed by
Cole (1981, p. 36-41; 1982), indicate that sufficient fidelity
exists in the midden-vegetation relationship to permit
accurate reconstruction to at least the community-type
level (table 1). The possibility that first-order errors have
been made in this study (such as reconstruction of juni-
per woodland when ponderosa-pine forest was actually
present) is remote. Errors may exist in second-order
reconstructions of specific plant associations (table 1),
but this also is unlikely. Analyses of modern packrat
middens show that plant species that are abundant or
common in nearby vegetation are well-represented in the
assemblages. Therefore, it is unlikely that a macrofossil
assemblage would be interpreted as representing, say, a
juniper-shrub woodland, when a pinyon-juniper wood-
land was actually present. Studies of modern middens
thus far have failed to demonstrate consistent biases
in foraging behavior of packrats that would invalidate
the conclusions presented here. These paleoecological
reconstructions usually are based on multiple macrofos-
sil assemblages controlled by multiple radiocarbon dates.
Non-representative assemblages may be sampled on
occasion, but these would have little effect on paleoeco-
logical reconstructions based on many samples.
  Diverse bioclimatic regions of the western United States
provide a range of general analogs to the fossil records
that are used to infer the nature of late Quaternary
climates. Use of such analogs provides an effective paleo-
environmental tool, even though exact analogs between
vegetation and environments of the late Pleistocene and


those of today probably do not exist (Hare, 1976; Birks,
1981). Thus, the climate that existed at the time when
xerophytic juniper woodland was widespread is assumed
to have been more similar to that of current dry wood-
land than to that of less similar vegetation types in
existence now. There are no logical alternatives to the
assertion that, because the late Wisconsin vegetation of
the Nevada Test Site region resembled current vegeta-
tion of northern Nevada, the past climate probably was
more similar to the present climate of that area than any
other area.
  The fossil record provides evidence for various paleo-
ecological phenomena which, in turn, are used to recon-
struct different aspects of the past climate. Among the
most important used in this study are values of the
relative vertical displacement of individual species and
the inferred absence of particular taxa from the region
during the late Wisconsin.

		ELEVATIONAL DISPLACEMENT

  Estimates of minimum elevational displacement of
limber pine and Utah juniper (table 8) are based on a
large data set. Contributing environmental variables,
such as aspect, exposure, and substrate, were considered
in the calculation of displacement estimates (Spaulding,
1981, p. 166-171). Wells (1977, p. 238) has cautioned that
a vertical uncertainty of 100 m may exist in such estimates,
because of the possibility of downslope transport of plant
fragments from higher elevations. This is balanced, to
some extent, by the probability that the lowest fossil
record of a particular species does not reflect the lowest
elevation that it attained. Neither consideration should
seriously affect the validity of minimum estimates. For
example, the three lowest fossil records of limber pine on
calcareous substrate in the region are within 50-m eleva-
tion of each other and are from different sites (Spaulding,
1981, table 35). At one of these sites, Basin Canyon-1 at
an elevation of 1,635 m in the Sheep Range (Spaulding,
1981, p. 136-140), limber pine is well represented in the
macrofossil assemblages. It is improbable that these
fossils represent downslope transport, because: (1) They
are present in quantity; (2) the locality does not possess
extreme topographic relief (Spaulding, 1981, fig. 20);
and (3) two other middens from a different locality pro-
vide similar elevational records.
  Occurrence of limber pine and Utah juniper far below
their lowest modern populations is attributed to cooler
summers during the late Wisconsin. These two taxa
were chosen as indicator species of summer tempera-
tures because they are the most xerophytic arboreal taxa
in present subalpine (limber pine) and woodland (Utah
juniper) vegetation. The assumption is made that their
downward displacement primarily was due to increased

slopes is evident. Furthermore, the range of Mojave prickleleaf
(Hecastocleis shockleyi Gray) was apparently attenuated on north-
ern slopes during the full glacial, while Forsellesia pungens Heller
occurred on both mesic and xeric exposures.
  Similar phenomena have been documented in the Grand Canyon
(Cole, 1981) as well as in the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts.
Plants presently restricted to washes in the low deserts, such as
catclaw acacia (Acacia greggii Gray), occurred on rocky slopes dur-
ing the Wisconsin (Van Devender, 1973; Van Devender and
Spaulding, 1979). Van Devender and Riskind (1979) have recorded
the presence of woodland on limestone during the late glacial in the
Hueco Mountains of western Texas. These mesophytic plants persist
in the area to this day but are restricted to outcrops of syenite. The


obtained, they were recorded over relatively long intervals. Comparisons with
core values such as shown in Figures 2 and 3 were not appropriate because
of the large volumes of rock involved. However, full-wave acoustic logs permit
examination of shear velocities and dynamic moduli on a much smaller scale.
This enables comparisons of small-interval in situ readings with core values
obtained in the laboratory.
  Although data obtained from the 3-D log yield sufficient information on
elastic constants without resorting to logs other than density, it is desirable
for several reasons to attempt to relate these data to another log or less elabo-
rate combination of logs. This arises from the difficulty at times in obtaining
a shear velocity. To obtain the dynamic moduli, a shear velocity is needed.
Occasionally in the borehole the attenuation characteristics of the medium are
such that a shear wave is hard to discern on a 3-D log. In addition, the density
log is not always easily obtained due to borehole effects.
  Of the three variables -~ shear and compressional wave velocity and den-
sity -~ required to calculate dynamic moduli, the measurement most easily

general suggestions except to urge caution in the use of regressions that are based
on very few data points. The weighted least-squares regressions ("WLS" in tables
and figures) are for purposes of heuristic comparison and not intended for practical
applications. The regressions should not be extrapolated beyond the range of the

  Exceedance probability. Although regression models of magnitude on log L can be
used to estimate the most likely magnitude for a given maximum rupture, it must
be stressed that such an estimate is not a maximum magnitude, but rather the
magnitude that could be expected to be exceeded in 50 per cent of the earthquakes
associated with that rupture length.
  It is possible to use the regression models to estimate the magnitude, as a function
of depth, that could be expected to be exceeded in a given proportion (1 - ~) of

eruptive volumes, vesicularity, and degree of
chemical differentiation decreased.
  Pyroclastic flows were first observed shortly after
noon on May 18; resulting deposits extend as much as
8 km from the vent, cover an area of about 15 km2,
and have a bulk volume of about 0.2 km3 (Rowley
and others). The deposits form a fan-like pattern of
sheets, tongues, and lobes of mostly poorly sorted
ash and clasts of pumice and dense dacite. Succes-
sively younger 1980 pyroclastic-flow deposits, in gen-
eral, cover progressively smaller areas and have
smaller volumes. The flows formed along with devel-
opment of large vertical ash columns. Most pyro-
clastic flows originated when bulbous masses of ash,
lapilli, and blocks rose only a short distance above
the inner crater before spreading laterally to the
north, but some flows were observed to result from
gravitational collapse of parts of an accompanying
vertical ash column.
  Morphologic and rheologic measurements on pyro-
clastic-flow deposits of July 22 and August 7 indicate
that the flows moved as non-Newtonian fluids, most
readily modelled as Bingham plastics (Wilson and
Head). Reverse grading of coarse, low-density
pumice clasts in marginal levee deposits is interpreted
as the consequence of briefly increased fluidization,
related to interaction between the flow and surround-
ing air at the time of emplacement.
  Petrographic and textural studies indicate that all
1980 pyroclastic-flow deposits consist mainly of
juvenile dacite, containing plagioclase, hypersthene,
hornblende, and Fe-Ti-oxide phenocrysts in a vesic-
ular glassy matrix (Kuntz and others). In general, suc-
cessively younger deposits show increasing modal
proportions of plagioclase, hypersthene, and Fe-Ti-
oxide phenocrysts, increasing average anorthite con-
tent of plagioclase, increasing phenocryst:glass ratios,
and decreasing porosity. These relations suggest that
successive eruptions have tapped deeper levels in a
compositionally zoned magma chamber, have pro-
gressively depleted the magma of volatiles, and have
been characterized by decreased amounts of vesicula-
tion and gas thrust.

ANALYSIS OF
POTENTIAL HAZARDS

  Predictions of potential eruptions and assessments
of volcanic hazards, based on the past activity of
various volcanoes in the Cascade Range, have been
made over about the past 15 yr for long-range land-
use planning. These assessments postulate kinds,
locations, severity, frequency, and effects of future
eruptions and suggest some possible responses. Such
an assessment for Mount St. Helens was completed in
the mid-1970's and the report published in 1978.
Because such assessments are for long-range plan-
ning, they differ from day-to-day hazard assessments,
which in addition to past activity consider current in-
formation provided by monitoring. A skeleton array
of seismometers, recently emplaced, picked up the in-
itial earthquakes associated with the 1980 eruptions,
and was expanded to monitor seismic activity
through the rest of the year. Thus, the eruptions
tested predictions of potential eruptions and their
associated hazards, and also the efficacy of seismic
monitoring for a Cascade Range volcano.
  After May 18, the new potential hazard created by
debris-avalanche deposits that raised Spirit Lake and
dammed several streams tributary to the North Fork
Toutle River led to stability analysis of the debris-av-
alanche and computer-aided analyses of floods that
could result from its overtopping.
  Initial USGS recommendations in response to the
increase in earthquakes at Mount St. Helens (Miller
and others) were based entirely on past eruptive ac-
tivity at the volcano. Access to the volcano was re-
stricted first because of danger from snow avalanches
on the cone itself. As seismic activity increased, ac-
cess to the area around Mount St. Helens was re-
stricted because of the likelihood of eruptions. After
the first eruption, recommendations regarding haz-
ards and appropriate responses were based not only
on the record of past activity, but also on day-to-day
visual and instrumental monitoring. USGS hazards-
analysis coordinators described ranges of expectable
eruptions, possible responses, and expectable warn-
ings to government officials, private interests, and the
public. Hazards forecasts were generally accurate,
but the magnitude of the massive landslide and
laterally directed blast of May 18 exceeded expecta-
tions. Experiences during the 1980 eruptions em-


phasized the need for a hazards assessment before an
eruption occurs, an extensive monitoring network, an
onsite agency capable of handling emergency situa-
tions, and hazards-assessment personnel familiar with
local geography and land use as well as the eruptive
record.
  Some seismometers were in place at and near the
volcano when the March activity began, and the net-
work was immediately expanded when a swarm of
earthquakes followed that of March 20 (Malone and
others). After March 25 frequency and magnitude of
earthquakes leveled off, however, and no further
changes signaled the cataclysmic eruption of May 18.
After May 18, a relatively low background of seismic
activity allowed changes to be more readily recog-
nized; the eruptions of June 12 and August 7 were
preceded by increases in level of harmonic tremor,
and eruptions of July 22 and October 16 were pre-
ceded by increased numbers of shallow volcanic
earthquakes. For each of these, the precursors were
recognized and warnings issued at least 2 hr before
the eruption began.
  A review of eruption forecasting on a probabilistic
basis, using both evidence from past events and mon-
itoring, is encouraging (Decker). Two approaches are
fruitful-~the documentation of past eruptive history
to provide evidence of long-term potential kinds and
frequencies of eruptions, and monitoring to provide
information about eruption potential on a short-term
basis. Some predictions of Mount St. Helens eruptive
events and effects were very successful, including
those for most events of May 18, and of forthcoming
eruptions in June, July, August, October, and
December. Eight significant eruptions in 1980 were
preceded by multiple phenomena over periods of
months to hours; false alarms that occurred generally
were based on occurrence of only one precursory-
type phenomenon. Significant improvements are still
needed in judging extents, magnitudes, times, and
locations of coming eruptive events, especially when
seismic activity is high. Gas studies show promise of
predicting times of forthcoming eruptions, and
ground-deformation studies and thermal monitoring
have detected some changes that could be useful for
anticipating specific events.
  After the May 18 eruption, the huge debris ava-
lanche in the North Fork Toutle River valley raised
the level of Spirit Lake by about 60 m. The debris was
known to contain abundant water and hydrother-

and snow thicknesses where cracks in the glaciers
reveal bedrock below, changes in texture of rock and
ice on the bulge, and differences in snow condition
and runoff.
  In order to produce a digital terrain model, the
three-dimensional coordinates digitized during map
compilation were transferred by magnetic tape to the
U.S. Geological Survey Flagstaff Image Processing
Facility. Raster images of the contour lines were made
with a resolution of 5 m per pixel (picture element).
The resulting raster image of contour lines, approx-
imately 2,000 pixels square, was filled in by broad-


ening individual contour lines until they met, and
generating an intermediate contour level at their in-
tersection. This process was repeated until no picture
elements were unassigned, thus generating a full
elevation array on the digital terrain model.
  This procedure differs from conventional topo-
graphic mapping in that no hand-editing of any kind
is done to the position of the contour lines. In areas
where the positional uncertainty exceeds the contour
interval, contour lines may actually cross. This prob-
lem is particularly noticeable within large snowfields
that have no identifiable surface features. The digital
terrain model can be cosmetically improved by use of
a 3 ~ 3 pixel (15 m square) low-pass filter that replaces
each pixel with the average of nine pixels in the
original array. This process has no effect in areas of
uniform slope; it tends to subdue the topography
slightly in areas of rapid slope changes, and it is par-
ticularly effective in removing the slope reversals due


to erroneous contour crossing. The preeruption
digital terrain model, filtered in this manner, was
processed to produced a shaded-relief image of the
topography (fig. 79).
  As mentioned previously, during the last few days
before May 18, suitable photography could rarely be
obtained without the presence of some atmospheric
obscuration. In order to construct as complete a
digital model as possible for a late date prior to May
18, the digital terrain data for May 16 were used to fill
in the region obscured on May 12; the resulting com-
posite is called the May 12/16 model.
  The changes in elevation and thus changes in
volume could be automatically determined by simply
subtracting the digital terrain model for one date from
that of another. From these terrain-difference models,
a map was produced to show the changes from
pre-1980 to May 12/16 (fig. 80). The total volume
change can be computed directly by summing over all
the elements of the elevation-difference array. This
automatic processing of elevation data renders ob-
vious the major topographic variations: the large ap-
parent upward motion of the surface of the upper
Forsyth Glacier, subsidence of the large graben across
the summit area of the mountain, and the northwest
displacement and small vertical change in the Goat
Rocks area. Topographic change between pre-1980
and April 11 and from April 11 to May 12/16 are
shown in figures 81A and B, respectively. The bulging
of the north side of the mountain and the graben for-
mation at the summit can be seen in both images.
Over the second period, the response of the Forsyth
Glacier to initial oversteepening can be seen as a
relative increase in elevation (actually, largely lateral
motion of a sloping surface) of the lower part of the
glacier.
  The general unreliability of control points on the
upper parts of Mount St. Helens resulted in apparent
elevation changes of several meters in areas that
surveying indicated to be stable in April and May
(Lipman, Moore, and Swanson, this volume). In
order to correct for these errors in the photogram-
metric models, the apparent elevation changes were
determined along a line surrounding the area of
definite topographic change (fig. 80). The mean and
standard deviation of the differences between digital
terrain models for this line of about 1,500 points are:

1972 to April 11, 1980: + 1.2~~11.2 m,
1972 to May 12/16: + 1.3 ~~ 7.9 m.


eruption was greater than 50~C, hot enough to result
in leaf death. However, volcanic SO2 or droplets of
H2SO4 may also have played a role in causing leaf
death. Site 1 was closer to the volcanic crater, was
higher in elevation, and was subjected to tempera-
tures nearly 200~C cooler than site 2. Although hot
ejecta were deposited on site 1, this site was at the
southern margin of the eruption cloud and it is in-
ferred from this study that the air temperatures re-
mained relatively cool. Site 2 was 2,400 m lower in
elevation than the crater and 21 km away, but it was
in one main path of the directed blast. The higher air
temperatures at site 2 may have resulted from heated
air, which was trapped and carried between hot ash
particles that were falling and flowing downhill.
Analyses of leaves from additional sites (fig. 185) may
provide further insight into the temperature patterns
in the seared zone of the blast area. These estimates
would be of geological interest and could reveal pat-
terns of heat dispersion from the eruption of May 18,
1980.

250 excavations scattered east to northwest of the
volcano (fig. 353). The total-thickness isopach map of
May 18 units shows a broad northward lobe and a
sharp east-northeast lobe (fig. 355). These lobes are
the deposit from two principal events of May 18: (1) a
directed blast (pyroclastic density flow) that cata-
strophically swept 10-25 km to the north, northwest,
and northeast and an attendant air fall extending
another 30 km outward (Waitt, this volume); and (2)
the vertical eruptive column and other events that
ejected material high enough to enter the east-
northeast windstream. All but roughly 2 cm (layer
A3) of the northward lobe is the direct deposit of the
blast (density-flow) event (layers A1 and A2) (figs.
258, 262 and 263). The east-northeast lobe comprises
four overlapping air-fall units, mostly coarse air-fall
pumice and lithic fragments from the central eruptive
column (unit B). But the four units do not all emanate
from exactly the same source area.


  Beyond 5 km from the volcano, there is little local
variation in thickness of the primary air-fall units
within or among nontimbered areas. Near the trunks
of living conifers, however, air-fall material is
somewhat thinner because of outward shedding by
the limbs overhead.

other land uses in areas downvalley and downwind
from Mount St. Helens occurred almost entirely after
1857, the time of the last eruption prior to 1980.
During the following 123 yr of volcano inactivity,
communities, highways, bridges, hydroelectric dams
and reservoirs, railroads, and airports were con-
structed in the region, but the possible effects of
future eruptions on these developments was given
little or no thought. This disregard for volcanic erup-
tions in planning new developments has not been
unique to the Mount St. Helens region, but has char-
acterized the entire Cascade Range with its many in-
active but potentially dangerous volcanoes (Crandell
and others, 1979).

various kinds of volcanic events on structures and on
other developments that are vital to the economic
wellbeing of an entire region. Many of these effects

~oks~~z et. al., 1964; Toks~~z and Kehrer, 1971; among others). The surface-wave
~bservations provide the evidence which is most commonly cited for this source
asymmetry. For example, for the explosion GREELEY, the observed ratio of the
Love to Rayleigh wave excitation is much larger than would be predicted for a pure
explosion source and scattering in a simple layered earth. In addition, the Rayleigh
waves display a radiation pattern (Toks~~z and Kehrer, 1972). In the case of the
Shagan river region of the Eastern Kazakh Test site, explosions which are only
kilometers apart produce Rayleigh waves which are 180~ out of phase (North and
Fitch, 1981; Goforth, 1982). As for body waves, SH waves at teleseismic distances
are a fairly common observation (Nuttli, 1969). Similarly, in the near field, there are
tangential accelerograms which are much too large to be explained by simple
scattering (Aki et al., 1969).
  A widely accepted explanation for the phenomenon of SH-type seismic wave
generation by explosions is the release of tectonic strain. Considering the abundance
of examples for the influence of tectonic release on SH and surface waves, it is
somewhat surprising that there is very little documentation of its influence on P

STRATIGRAPHY

  More than 24,000 feet of Precambrian, lower
Paleozoic and Tertiary rocks crop out in the
Specter Range quadrangle. The Precambrian
and lower Paleozoic rocks are typical of the
clastic and carbonate rocks in the eastern part
of the Cordilleran geosyncline, and are more
than 22,000 feet thick. The Precambrian and
Paleozoic rocks have been divided into 16
mappable units (14 formations, two of which
contain two members each). The four oldest
formations, Precambrian to lower Middle
Cambrian, are composed of clastic rocks.
Quartzite, siltstone, and shale are the common
rock types; limestone and dolomite are minor
and occur as thin beds. From lower Middle
Cambrian through the Upper Devonian, the
rocks are mainly limestone and dolomite with
thin units of quartzite and quartz sandstone.
  Tertiary rocks are present mainly in the
northern part of the quadrangle and overlie
the Paleozoic rocks with angular uncon-
formity. They consist of a basal unit of tuf-
faceous sandstone, siltstone, conglomerate, and
lacustrine limestone, overlain by approximately
2000 feet of welded and nonwelded tuff of
rhyolitic and dacitic composition with inter-
bedded sandstone, siltstone, and conglomerate.
These rocks are mapped as one group sub-
divided into three informal units.
  Burchfiel (1964) described the formations
and members mapped during this investigation,
and general descriptions of these formations
and members are given in the stratigraphic

plate modified by synchronous strike-slip
movement on the Las Vegas shear zone.
Later work by Fleck (1967; 1970) and An-
derson and others (1972) demonstrated a
late Tertiary age for the Las Vegas shear
zone. Recent work by Davis (1973) and
Longwell (1973) have returned to
Longwell's original interpretation of the
Red Spring thrust. Only the westernmost
fault blocks containing the Red Spring
Thrust have been remapped and are shown
on Figure 3.
  Davis (1973) believes that rocks below
the Keystone thrust and south of the Cot-
tonwood fault, which belong to the Contact
thrust plate of Hewett (1931), are correla-


tive with the Red Spring thrust plate. He
further interprets the Cottonwood fault as
similar to faults that cut the Red Spring
thrust. Thus he suggests that the Red Spring
thrust plate once covered most of the Juras-
sic Aztec Sandstone shown on Figure 3, but
it was uplifted on a horst between the La
Madre and Cottonwood faults and was
subsequently eroded prior to the thrusting
of the Keystone thrust plate.
  Longwell (1926) described discontinuous
conglomerate lenses beneath the Red Spring
thrust which he interpreted as surficial de-
posits overridden by the thrust plate. A re-
study of these conglomerates by Davis
(1973) reconfirms Longwell's interpreta-

(3) the positions and ages of any suture belts that
may be present within the accreted arc terranes,
(4) many lithologic and structural details of the
complex allochthons, (5) adequate paleontologic
control on the ages of the rocks within the complex
allochthons, (6) the overall internal structural
architecture of the complex allochthons, and (7) the
tectonic relations of sedimentary sequences depos-
ited across the Antler orogen and foreland prior to
the Sonoma Orogeny, and across the Sonoma orogen
prior to intrusion of the Sierra Nevada batholith.

		PALEOPACIFIC OCEAN

  Knowledge of the late Paleozoic assembly and
post-Paleozoic fragmentation of Pangaea may help
define the ultimate paleogeographic origins of the
voluminous upper Paleozoic eugeosynclinal terranes
of oceanic and island-arc assemblages. Similar
suites of rock are present in broad accreted ter-
ranes northward along the Cordilleran orogen through
British Columbia and Alaska, and also across the
Pacific in Japan and adjacent parts of Eurasia
(Dickinson, 1977b). The temptation in each area of
their occurrence has been to suppose that each seg-
ment of this band of accreted eugeosynclinal mater-
ials is composed entirely of rocks formed in
marginal seas and fringing island areas or contin-
ental slivers that stood near the respective
continental margins. In each individual place,
this approach seems provincially to be the most
conservative stance and to invoke the fewest unsub-
stantiated assumptions. However, in aggregate,
this position requires that the initial distribution
of the marginal seas and fringing arcs lay in a
circumferential belt bordering but not involving the
central region of an ancestral Pacific Ocean. When
extended thus to the whole sweep of the northern
Pacific rim of the circum-Pacific orogenic belt,
there are powerful arguments that such a view is
wholly untenable. Instead, it is likely that each
segment of the orogenic belt includes eugeosynclinal
increments swept against the continental margin from
thousands of kilometers away.

Panthalassa as Paleopacific Ocean

  Consider the global configuration of continents
and oceans in Permo-Triassic time about 250 mybp.
The Atlantic and Indian oceans had not yet opened
to split Pangaea. The vast Panthalassa ocean was
essentially a Paleopacific realm lying offshore
from both the Americas and Japan. On conventional
paleogeographic reconstructions such as Figure 7,
the paleo-Pacific region occupies nearly half the
surface of the earth. Reference to Figure 2 sug-
gests that several oceanic belts of indeterminate
width probably still stood open in the Asian and
Alaskan regions, but even so the Paleopacific Ocean
must have had an immense expanse. The various suture
belts along which the major crustal blocks of Pan-
gaea were welded together had already closed in the
Appalachian, European, Uralian, and Pan-African
regions during Paleozoic orogenies.
  Note that the whole floor of the Paleopacific
Ocean was pre-Jurassic in age (the Jurassic had not
yet come at the time!). By contrast, the entire
floor of the present Pacific Ocean is known to be
Jurassic or younger from magnetic anomalies and
deep-sea drilling. This can only mean that the
entire floor of the pre-Jurassic Paleopacific
Ocean has been subducted, mainly in the circum-
Pacific region, since Triassic time. As the
pacific lithosphere descended into the mantle,


monly fill pore spaces in the reduced sandstones and conglomerates; frag-
ments of wood, lignite, or bone material that acted as centers of reduction
were replaced by rich concentrations of uranium minerals-~whole pseudo-
morphed logs of uraninite and brilliantly colored uranium-vanadium oxides
were rich prizes encountered in many mines. The principal ore minerals
after pitchblende and coffinite are canary yellow carnotite
[K(UO2)2(VO4)2~3H2O] and tyuyamunite [Ca(UO2)(VO4)2~5-8H2O], bright
yellow-orange-red gummite (a mineraloid mixture of hydrous oxides of
U, Th, and Pb), and a variety of yellow, orange, blue, and black vanadium
oxides like montroseite [VO(OH)]. Minor amounts of pyrite, marcasite, ga-
lena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, bornite, chalcocite, covellite, and many other
sulfide minerals also are found. Minor amounts of native selenium are char-
acteristically associated with some uranium and uranium-vanadium ores,
and the molybdenum oxide ilsemannite (Mo3O8~nH2O?) is also common (Kerr,
1958).
  The ore-bearing formations are nearly horizontal, but they are dis-
turbed in places by moderately strong monoclinal and anticlinal folds and
by high-angle faults. Major structural basins, such as the San Juan Basin,
the Uinta Basin, and the Piceance Basin, delimit relatively barren areas
between which there are clusters of ore deposits. A regional northwesterly
structural grain apparently reflects deep-seated igneous and tectonic move-
ments, yet there seems to be no direct relationship between the distribution
of uranium and regional structure, except insofar as tectonic history has
controlled sedimentation, geomorphology, and igneous activity, and insofar
as the ore deposits lie within the uplifted tectonically positive regions be-
tween structural basins (Kelley, 1955; Kerr, 1958). Salt domes and various
types of igneous intrusives are widely distributed in the Colorado Plateau,
and lava flows and pyroclastics are also present. Except for some Precam-
brian batholiths, the intrusives are all Miocene or younger. No general
spatial distribution between igneous activity and ore deposits can be dem-
onstrated, except where uranium mineralization is associated with dia-
tremes and volcanic collapse structures (Shoemaker, 1956).
  The origin and source locales of the ore components have been the
subjects of much discussion and disagreement. Four principal ideas have
been advanced. It has been argued that (1) the ores are syngenetic and
were deposited with the sediments or as an early diagenetic cement, (2)
the uranium and vanadium were leached from overlying or interlayered
tuffs and volcanic rocks, (3) groundwaters leached the metals from the
enclosing sands or from nearby granitic sources, forming deposits where
the proper Eh-pH conditions prevailed or where groundwater circulation
was channeled, and (4) the ores are products of ascending hydrothermal
fluids derived from underlying magmas (McKelvey, Everhart, and Garrels,
1955). The syngenetic hypothesis was one of the first proposed (Coffin, 1921;
Fischer, 1950), and was widely accepted until the 1950s (Wright, 1955;
Fischer, 1956); it was based in large part upon the obvious association

The post-Antler Great Basin.


island extended north-northeast across the entire
length of the Great Basin, from California to south-
ern Idaho. The cool rock in my hand contained frag-
ments of marine sediment from the Antler Moun-
tains. The great heap of stacked marine sediment
created a mountain system that pressed down on
the crust, and the edge of the continent foundered
from the weight. A deep, ocean-filled basin formed
east of the thrust front. The fragments that com-
posed my rock washed and tumbled down into this
Mississippian trough. The trough filled rapidly with
the great volumes of debris that flooded down the
flanks of the Antler Highlands. Deltas and turbidite
fans banked in against the submerged flanks of the
uplift in thick heaps of gravels and coarse angular
clastics. Locally this pile of debris is more than ten
thousand feet thick.
  Only the finest clastics washed to the continental
shoreline, far to the east of the Antler Mountains.
These shales interbedded with limestones and dol-
omites on the shallow continental shelf. The thin
Mississippian shelf sediments are only one-tenth as
thick as the basin sediments.
  What was the environment to the west of the
Antler Mountains? We aren't certain, since there are


only a few scattered outcrops of Antler-aged rocks
found today to the west. These siliceous and vol-
canic rocks indicate deposition below the snowline
in a deep-water oceanic region, so we presume it
was deep ocean to the west. There is, however, a
thick sequence of late Paleozoic volcanic rocks to
the west of the Antler. These may not relate to
Antler time, but they are perhaps part of an exten-
sive younger island arc terrane. The volcanics are
now largely buried by younger rocks.
  Later events were to move the western rocks over
the former Antler highland. Their present locations
may not relate to their past sites of deposition. When
the clues are later moved around, it is difficult to de-
termine the original scene of the events.
  We do know that the North American continent
was slowly drifting northward across the equator
during the late Paleozoic. In Mississippian time, the
equator lay just to the south of the Great Basin,
trending from Los Angeles to northern Wisconsin.
In Pennsylvanian time, the Great Basin was on the
equator, as it stretched from San Francisco to Salt
Lake City. By the Permian, the equator extended
from northern California to Minnesota and the
Great Basin was just in the southern hemisphere.


gado, a few kilometers north of the fortieth parallel. Beyond Delgado, the fault
apparently arcs to the west and becomes the submarine Gorda scarp. This curve
is shown by submarine rift topography, the beheading of a submarine canyon,
and a smoothly arcuate canyon that opens at the base of the scarp [Shepard and
Emery, 1941, pp. 38-42; Shepard, 1957]. Epicenters of distinctive Franciscan-
continental-crust earthquakes, generated within 10 km of the surface, extend
along the Gorda scarp [Cameron, 1961]. This north-facing scarp is about 1.5
km high and has an average slope of about 30~ [Krause et al., 1964, Figure 3].
We infer from the onshore geology that the Gorda scarp bounds a continental
block formed of Franciscan terrane; consistent with this inference, dredge hauls
from the crest of the scarp at a depth of about 2 km and about 110 km offshore
included serpentine [Krause et al., 1964, pp. 248-249]. The San Andreas fault
thus swings westward from a coastal trend to one directly offshore and displaces
the continental margin directly seaward; the Gorda scarp is developed along the
margin of the higher standing continental plate.
  The north-facing Gorda scarp is directly continuous with the south-facing
Mendocino escarpment, which begins at the foot of the continental slope (Figure
5) and continues westward for something like 2500 km. The crossover occurs
where the depth of the continental slope south of the Gorda scarp becomes
greater than the depth of the crest of the Mendocino escarpment. The Mendocino
structure apparently marks a left-lateral strike-slip fault, probably inactive,
along which a distinctive pattern of magnetic anomalies and the westward-
sloping ocean floor have been displaced about 1150 km [Vacquier et al., 1961].
The near-shore part of the Mendocino escarpment is marked by a submarine
ridge, which stands 2 to 2.5 km above the ocean floor to the south but only
about 1 km above the floor to the north, and is formed of basalt [Krause et al.,
1964, Figure 4 and pp. 247-248].
  The San Andreas fault thus turns directly seaward at the point at which
the south-facing Mendocino escarpment projects into the continent. San Andreas
and Mendocino displacements are in opposite senses; hence they cannot be part
of a single motion system. The San Andreas is highly active; the Mendocino,
apparently inactive. These anomalies, and the other features of the San Andreas-
Gorda structure, are easily accounted for if the continental plate west of the
San Andreas fault is riding over the crust of the Pacific Ocean basin. The
narrow continental slice west of the San Andreas has been drifting northwest-
ward, past interior and northern California, throughout Cenozoic time, and its
point may have been deflected westward as it encountered the south-facing
Mendocino escarpment on the ocean floor. About 100 km of displacement along
the San Andreas has postdated this encounter, the balance having occurred
before the coastal strip reached the escarpment. The inception of the Eel River
basin, which trends northwestward just north of Cape Mendocino, in the late
Miocene [Ogle, 1953] may have been due to deformation resulting from the
initial impinging of the San Andreas sliver against the Mendocina scarp. De-
formation of the Eel River basin has continued to the present.
  Significance. The San Andreas fault system thus appears to end both to the

an inland body of water, fresh or saline, that is
too large to be called a pond. Attempting to
quantify the difference between lake and pond
is as futile as trying to define the useful but in-
exact terms mountain and hill. Swamps and
marshes are distinguished by abundant vegeta-
tion in the water; they may be as large as lakes
or as small as ponds.
  According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the
lakes of North America, including the Great
Lakes contain about a quarter of all the world's
fresh surface water. This volume of water is

and weakly developed, for the ash is young and
not deeply weathered. The organic layer is thin
or lacking. At many playas the soils are alkaline
or saline.
  The Payette Section and Snake River Plain are
mantled with loess 2 to 10 feet deep, and these
soils also have weakly developed profiles and are
classed as Desert Soils. In places, however, there
are Brown Soils with distinct soil horizons. On
the north side of the Snake River Plain extensive
areas are bare lava.

Water Resources

Despite being semiarid the Columbia-Snake
River Plateau has abundant water supplies, both
as surface water and as groundwater. The Co-


lumbia River enters the province with an average
annual discharge greater than the Missouri River.
Where it leaves the province and enters the Cas-
cade Range the discharge is nearly half that of
the Mississippi River at Memphis. Its principal
tributary, the Snake River, has a discharge 3 or
4 times that of the Colorado River.
  A network of dams and reservoirs has been
constructed along the Columbia River (Fig. 17.30).
The largest, the Grand Coulee Dam, partly takes
the place of the Pleistocene ice dam of the
Okanogan glacial lobe. The dam is 550 feet high
and more than 4,000 feet long. The Franklin D.
Roosevelt Lake above it stores nearly 20,000,000
acre-feet of water, some of which is pumped to
a storage reservoir in Grand Coulee, where it is
distributed for irrigation in Quincy Basin (Fig.
17.21).

altitude. The mountains are composed largely of
late Mesozoic granitic, batholiths-~by far the
greatest of the batholiths along the Pacific Coast
of North America, 1,000 miles long and in places
more than 100 miles wide. At many places the
western base of the mountains descends abruptly
to oceanic depths some thousands of feet below
sea level: the relief, therefore, is much greater
than the mountainous heights one sees. At Van-
couver and Queen Charlotte islands and the is-
lands of southeastern Alaska are comparative
lowlands formed of Paleozoic and Mesozoic
eugeosynclinal sedimentary formations. The
many islands are separated by deep trenches,
most of them fault valleys. The summits are very
jagged with numerous matterhorns and aretes
between the ice-filled cirques. Many or most of
the glaciers extend to within 500 feet of the sea
and some reach the sea. The deep, steep-walled
valleys that extend into the mountains form
spectacular fjords. During the Pleistocene, gla-
ciers from the Coast Mountains crossed the Strait
of Georgia and extended onto Vancouver Island.
  East of the Coast Mountains are interior
mountain ranges, mostly under 8,000 feet altitude,


and mostly formed of folded Mesozoic eugeo-
synclinal formations. Associated with these
ranges are extensive plateaus capped by lavas.
The most extensive of these extends the southern
half of British Columbia covering about 15,000
square miles along each side at an altitude of
about 3,000 to 4,000 feet. It covers much of the
south half of British Columbia. The lava-capped
plateau, at an altitude of 3,000 to 4,000 feet, has
three large shield volcanoes near the middle of
the west side. The lavas are Tertiary to Holocene
in age. They overlie folded and faulted eugeo-
synclinal sedimentary formations, including
Paleozoic rocks on the east and Mesozoic on the
west. The canyon of the Frazer River is incised
into the plateau and reaches the Strait of Georgia
in a valley that curves around the south end of
the Coast Mountains (Fig. 18.29).
  Uplift of the Coast Mountains began in Juras-
sic time, and during the Cretaceous Period this
was part of a mountainous area west of the geo-
synclinal sea that connected the Gulf of Mexico
and the Artic Ocean (Fig. 2.14,C; p. 378). Struc-
tural deformation and igneous activity have con-
tinued to the present time. One volcano, Mount

  Alternate hypotheses assign most right-lateral
movement to much earlier times. Albers (1967) argues
that movement along the Walker Lane began in Early
Jurassic (about 150 m.y. ago). He notes that Jurassic
plutons conform to the structural bends associated
with right-lateral movement but notes that the plu-
tons are not internally sheared. He also cites tight
folding in the Miocene Esmeralda Formation as evi-
dence for at least minor Miocene to Pliocene shearing
along Walker Lane. The same investigator argues for
post-early Tertiary movement along the Las Vegas
Valley Shear Zone because local Cretaceous and youn-
ger rocks are deformed along right-lateral trends.
Thus, Albers (1967) suggests that right-lateral move-
ment in southern Nevada started in the Mesozoic and
continued at least until the early or middle Tertiary.
  Invoking plate tectonic theory Atwater (1970) fol-
lows Wise (1963) in suggesting that a diffused plate
boundary exists between the Great Basin and San
Andreas shear zones. Atwater (1970) assigns all move-
ment to ages younger than 30 m.y. with most as less
than 6 m.y., at least along the San Andreas system.
This suggestion is not incompatible with the conclu-
sions of Carr (1974) and Longwell (1974) based on
local evidence.

Left-Lateral Faulting
  Left-lateral shearing in the NTS area is not so
easily related to regional structures. Carr (1974) sug-
gests a zone of northeast trending left-lateral shearing
occurs in the southern NTS area with displacement
broadly distributed among numerous individual fault
planes (Poole et al., 1965b; Orkild, 1968; Ekren and
Sargent, 1965; Hinrichs, 1968a). Three major fault
zones of left-lateral movement have been identified:
the Mine Mountain (not to be confused with the Mine
Mountain Thrust Fault); the Cane Springs; and the
Rock Valley fault zones (Figures 27 and 29). Another
left-lateral shear zone may transect Timber Mountain
(Carr, informal communication) (Figure 27).
  Carr (1974) argues that left-lateral movement has
been slight and is a component of oblique-slip dis-
placement. The left-lateral faults offset, and in turn,
are offset by right-lateral movement along the Las
Vegas Valley Shear Zone, indicating simultaneous
development of the two strike-slip systems (Carr,
1974). Carr (1974) cites stratigraphic evidence of de-
creasing activity along the left-lateral system begin-
ning about 11 m.y. ago, with only minor offsets con-
tinuing until the present. Rogers et al. (1977) present
evidence of slight current seismic activity along these
left-lateral shear zones.


of this unit. It is overlain by fine-
grained clastic rocks of the third
unit. The two units in the upper
half of the formation are a light-
gray and orange limestone and, at
the top, a darker gray thick-bedded
clayey, silty, or dolomitized lime-
stone that is marbleized at some
places.
  The lower half of the Carrara
formation is greenish-, yellowish-,
and brownish-gray shale with 1 or
2 bands of dark-gray limestone,
which form ledges in the steep shaly
slope. The upper half of the for-
mation forms a striking series of
broken cliffs, visible from a distance
as a broad band of alternating
white, orange, pink, and brown
limestone overlain by dark-gray
limestone.
  The upper contact is not easily
discernible and the Carrara forma-
tion appears to be transitional into
the overlying Bonanza King forma-
tion through a zone of irregularly
dolomitized limestone with dolomi-
tization increasing upwards into
the overlying formation.
  A trilobite, identified only as an
olenellid type, collected from a bed
beneath the algal (Girvanella)
limestone in the lower part of the
formation indicates a late Early
Cambrian age. The age of the
Carrara formation is Early and
Middle Cambrian and it correlates
roughly both in lithology and in
overall thickness with units of the
same age overlying the Stirling(?) and
Prospect Mountain quartzites in the
Atomic Energy Commission Nevada
Proving Grounds (Johnson and
Hibbard, 1957, p. 336-342) and
Groom district (Humphrey, 1945,
p. 23-26) respectively.


BONANZA KING FORMATION (~bk)
  Alternating light- and dark-gray
dolomite layers, forming a sequence
3,800feet thick, are correlated on the
basis of stratigraphic position and
lithology with the Bonanza King
formation of the type locality in
the Providence Mountains, Calif.
(Hazzard and Mason, 1936, p. 234-
238), and with the Bonanza King
formation in the Nopah Range,
Calif., as revised by Palmer and
Hazzard (1956, p. 2494-2499). The
formation is mostly thin- to thick-
bedded dolomite with a few zones
as much as 150 feet thick that
contain intercalated silty and sandy
layers and partings, and locally thin
cherty zones.
  A complete section measured
north of the mouth of Tungsten
Canyon contains roughly a dozen
units that differ from one another
chiefly in content of clastics, chert,
and secondary dolomite and in the


  Pseudoagnostus, a distinct Upper
Cambrian agnostid, as well as other
poorly preserved agnostid and
aphelaspid trilobite forms, have
been identified from the lower shale
member of the Nopah formation at
Bare Mountain. These indicate the
equivalence of the member with the
basal Nopah formation at its type
locality in the Nopah Range, Cali-
fornia, and with the basal shaly
part of the Cornfield Springs for-
mation of Hazzard and Mason,
1937, in the Providence Mountains,
California (Palmer and Hazzard,
1956). The lower shale member of
the Nopah formation together with
several hundred feet of limestone
and dolomite above and below the
shale also correlate closely litho-
logically with the Dunderberg shale
and carbonate units adjacent to it
in the AEC Nevada Proving Grounds
(Johnson and Hibbard, 1957, p. 340-
345).

  POGONIP GROUP (Op)

  A limestone sequence 1,375 feet
thick measured at Bare Mountain
has been correlated with the Pogo-
nip group as defined in the revised
section of the type locality near
Eureka, Nevada (Nolan and others,
1956, p. 23-25; also see Hall and
MacKevett, 1958, p. 6). Units within
the group were not differentiated
during mapping. The lower third
of the group consists chiefly of silty,
cherty limestone with cherty dolo-
mite at the base; the upper two-
thirds of the group consists of shaly

	In 1947, Murata found that the quantity of silica determinable by
standard colorimetric methods in aged-water samples from Steamboat
Springs, Nevada, was much less than the total silica content determined
gravimetrically  (White, Brannock, and Murata, 1956). In contrast, it
was later found by Murata and White that the values for colorimetrically
determinable silica in fresh samples were approximately equal to those
for total silica determined gravimetrically. A series of detailed observa-
tions and measurements on the state of silica in hot spring waters were
then carried out in the field by Brannock and White (White, Brannock,
and Murata, 1956). In 1961, Morey and others reported upon the colori-
metrically determinable silica in water from several hot springs and
geysers in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. This work was con-
tinued in 1962 and 1963. Many of the results are shown in figure 2,
where the silica contents of various actively discharging hot springs
and geysers are plotted versus the temperature of the water in the pools.1
The circles indicate colorimetrically determined2 silica measured at
poolside immediately after collection. The triangles show the total dis-
solved silica content of each water sample.3 A curve showing the solubility


Progressing from the fresh waters to thermal waters, a marked
decrease occurs in the proportion of the divalent cations,
especially calcium, relative to the monovalent cations sodium
and potassium.
	Ratios of elements which may be useful in determining flow
direction and extents of solution-rock interaction have varying
patterns of distribution (Table 2). The high ratios of Cl/Ca
and Cl/Mg in thermal waters from along Hot Creek are prob-
ably due to the loss of carbon dioxide and the precipitation of
calcium carbonate at depth. The (Ca1/2)/Na ratios for these
springs are less than 1 for the same reason. Springs with higher
ratios of Cl/Ca and Cl/Mg generally have lower Ca/Mg ra-
tios, perhaps indicating precipitation of magnesian calcite.
Cl/(HCO3 + CO3) ratios decrease as spring temperature de-
creases. Truesdell [1975] attributed a similar change in Sho-
shone Geyser Basin, Yellowstone Park, Wyoming, to the reac-
tion


That is, as hot water cools in contact with alkali alumino-
silicate (or silicate) minerals at constant activity of the
alkali ions, the pH increases [Hemley, 1959] and more dis-
solved carbon dioxide is converted to bicarbonate with simul-
taneous introduction of alkali ions. If this reaction is con-
trolling the Cl(HCO3 + CO3) ratio, then the Cl/Na ratio should
change in a similar manner, and the ratio of Na/(Cl +
HCO3 + CO3) should remain approximately constant. The
Cl/Na ratios generally follow the Cl/(HCO3 + CO3) ratios,
although the Na/(Cl + CO3 + HCO3) ratios range from 0.81
to 1.05. Thermal springs along Hot Creek and Little Hot
Creek have constant ratios of Na/(Cl + CO3 + HCO3),
0.98-1.01, indicating that solution of sodium feldspar and
precipitation of clay may be controlling the ratio in this area.
However, lower ratios of Na/(Cl + CO3 + HCO3) and higher
Cl/K ratios in the area between Hot Creek and Lake Crowley
may indicate solution of something other than sodium feldspar
or the precipitation of some sodium-potassium phases.
	Low ratios of Na/K for thermal springs along Hot Creek
may indicate that they are associated with a higher-tem-
perature part of the thermal reservoir. Orville [1963] and
White [1965] have shown that low Na/K ratios indicate high
temperatures of equilibrium. The (Ca1/2)/Na ratios range from
0.28 for the steam well at Casa Diablo to 2.0 for the hot spring
on Little Hot Creek. Ratios of Cl/Rb, Na/Rb, and Na/Li
generally increase in hydrothermal areas as the fluids react
with the country rock, producing hydrothermal minerals
[Ellis, 1970]. In Long Valley, Cl/Rb, Na/Rb, and Na/Li
ratios are smallest for hot springs along Hot Creek, increasing
as spring temperatures decrease toward Lake Crowley. Per-
haps thermal spring waters issuing in the area between Hot
Creek and Lake Crowley have relatively less rubidium and
lithium because of more extensive reaction with the country
rock. The slight increase in Cl/Li and Cl/F as the spring
temperatures decrease may indicate loss of these minor ele-
ments into alteration minerals. Low NH3/Na ratios are found
in the springs which are releasing gas. Ratios of Cl/SO4 are
nearly constant, increasing slightly from northwest to south-
east with the highest ratios in thermal springs south of the
alkali lakes.
	Thermal springs in Long Valley have Cl/B ratios in the
range 6.6-5.6. Cl/B ratios for springs in and near Hot Creek
Gorge may be highest (6.4-6.6) because of phase separation
with loss of boron into the vapor phase. Such phase separation
is not uncommon in hot-water systems; this vapor phase con-






ABSTRACT

  Evaluation of volume and temperature data
available in June 1978 indicates that 1650 ~~ 140
x 1018 J are present in reservoirs of 215 iden-
tified hydrothermal convection systems ~~90~C in
the United States to a depth of 3 km (excluding
energy in National Parks). Thermal energy re-
coverable at the surface from these reservoirs
is estimated to be 400 ~~ 60 x 1018 J. Electri-
cal energy producible from identified high-
temperature (>150~C) systems is estimated to be
23,000 ~~ 3400 megawatts for 30 years, and bene-
ficial heat producible from identified interme-
diate-temperature (90~-150~C) systems is esti-
mated to be 42 ~~ 13 x 1018 J. Undiscovered
thermal energy is evaluated by geologic prov-
inces; the total undiscovered component is esti-
mated to be 8000 x 1018 J, of which 2000 x
1018 J might be recoverable. The total identi-
fied and undiscovered thermal energy in reser-
voirs of hydrothermal convection systems to a
depth of 3 km (excluding energy in National
Parks) is estimated to be 9600 x 1018 J. Total
recoverable energy of 2400 x 1018 J could con-
tribute 95,000-150,000 megawatts of electricity
for 30 years and 230-350 x 1018 J of beneficial
heat, with the higher number for electricity
going with the lower number for beneficial heat,
and conversely.

INTRODUCTION

  This report deals with hydrothermal convec-
tion systems in the United States with mean re-
servoir temperatures greater than or equal to
90~C and depths less than 3 km. Our goal is to
determine (1) the accessible resource base,
(2) the resource, and (3) the amount of elec-
tricity or beneficial heat that might be pro-
duced from these systems. We divide the thermal
energy in hydrothermal convection systems into
that which is identified and that which is un-
discovered. The identified systems are listed
in tables 4, 5, and 6, along with estimates of
their reservoir properties, thermal energy con-
tent, recoverable energy, and electricity or
beneficial heat production. Undiscovered ther-
mal energy is estimated by geomorphic province
and is listed in table 8.
  The accessible resource base is the stored
thermal energy for individual hydrothermal con-
vection systems and for the sum of all the sys-
tems. The accessible resource base for an in-
dividual system is defined for this assessment
as the amount of geothermal energy within a spe-
cified volume of rock and at a specified temper-


ature referenced to 15~C. The accessible re-
source base corresponds to the "resource base"
of White and Williams (1975) and Renner, White,
and Williams (1975) in the Assessment of Geo-
thermal Resources of the United States--1975
(U.S. Geological Survey Circular 726). It dif-
fers slightly from the "accessible resource
base" defined by Muffler and Cataldi (1978) in
that we refer to energy in the Earth between two
specified depths, rather than from the surface
to a specified depth. The depth limit of eco-
nomic production drilling for geothermal re-
sources varies with drilling costs and economics
and currently is about 3 km. As in the 1975 as-
sessment, we therefore do not consider any sys-
tem or part of a system deeper than 3 km.
  The recoverable energy is that fraction of
the accessible resource base that can be pro-
duced at the wellhead under reasonable assump-
tions of future technology and economics and is
defined as the resource (Muffler and Cataldi,
1978).
  Essential components of a hydrothermal con-
vection system are a heat source, a fluid (usu-
ally water but in a few rare instances steam),
and adequate vertical permeability to allow the
hot, low-density fluids to rise and, in most
systems, be replaced by cooler fluids. Most of
the thermal energy in the Earth is stored in
rocks. Convective circulation of hot fluids is
the primary mechanism whereby the energy is
transported to reservoirs near enough to the
Earth's surface so that it can be economically
extracted.
  Geologic settings of hydrothermal convection
systems in the United States are diverse. They
are most likely to develop in areas where there
is residual heat related to relatively young
volcanic activity and in areas where regional
heat flow is high. Fault zones appear to be the
most common conduits for movement of fluids in
convecting systems; locations of many systems
seem to be controlled by intersecting struc-
tures. Reservoirs from which the hot fluids are
produced can be either porous or fractured rock;
fracture reservoirs are more important in high-
temperature systems.
  Hydrothermal convection systems can be clas-
sified into two main types--vapor-dominated and
hot-water, depending on whether steam or liquid
water, respectively, is the continuous, pres-
sure-controlling phase in the reservoir. The
characteristics of each type of system have been
described by White, Muffler, and Truesdell
(1971), Truesdell and White (1973), and White
(1970, 1973).

   In obtaining the discharge rate for a few of the spring 
areas, where small channels conducted the flow to a
pool, the flow for each channel was estimated and the 
several flows were totaled. Small flows are difficult to 
estimate, but by making measurements  of width,
depth, and velocity, and checking these against 
volumetric measurements when feasible, it is believed 
reasonably accurate results were obtained.
   At Eagle Borax Spring the estimate of discharge was 
based on the area of phreatophyte growth in the
general spring area and a transpiration rate extrapolated
from other nearby areas after allowance was made for 
differences in temperature and humidity.

DESCRIPTIONS AND DISCHARGES OF SPRINGS AND
OF MARSHES

Salt Creek

   Seven float measurements of discharge of Salt Creek
were made about half a mile below McLean Falls in the
canyon, just before it emerges from the Salt Creek
Hills. The stream channel here flows on bedrock of 
fine-grained sandstone, and there is little opportunity
for underflow. The channel is from 4 to 6 feet wide,
but maximum depths are usually not more than 3 or 
4 inches. All the measurements were made at the same
location by T. W. Robinson. Depths were measured
with a steel tape and velocity by timing floats with a 
stopwatch. The measurements are believed to be
sufficiently accurate to show true variations in flow,
and these are attributed to evapotranspiration losses.


channels usually continue from the mud flats into the
permanent salt crust where the water eventually
disappears.
   The discharge of the spring area was estimated by 
noting the number of channels and estimating their 
flow. To this figure was added the loss by evaporation
from the seep areas of mud and salt. The combined 
flow in some 30 channels was estimated at 150 gpm.
The loss from 250 acres of salt and mud flat was esti-
mated as 75 gpm, making the total spring discharge
225 gpm.

Soda carbonate marsh, east side of Cottonball Basin
   This marsh is a much smaller spring area than the
one just described.  However, water was discharged
in much the same manner. The flow from 10 small
seep areas was estimated as 10 gpm, and loss from about
80 acres of mud and salt flat, partly overgrown wit~
salt grass, as about 20 gpm. Total discharge is 30 gpm


Marsh near Harmony Borax Mill

   This marsh is similar to, but smaller than, the sod~
carbonate marsh. Water is discharged from fou~
rather widely spaced seep areas. The discharge fro~
them was estimated at about 15 gpm. In addition
the loss in some 10-15 acres of wetted mud and sal
flat was estimated as about 5 gpm. Total discharg
for the area on this basis is about 20 gpm.
   The area next south of the marsh on the north sid
of the Harmony Borax Hills, where there is discharg
of water from springs onto the saltpan, is the alluvi~
fan of Furnace Creek Wash. However, the source ~
this water is largely from Travertine Springs in Furna~
Creek Wash, discussed on page B35.
   From Furnace Creek Wash south to Badwater,
distance of about 17 miles, there is no measurab~
discharge of water onto the saltpan. From Badwat~
south to the end of the saltpan there are several sprin~
and marshes.

Badwater

   According to Gudde (1949), the name Badwater ori~
nated in a notation on the Furnace Creek Atlas shee
published in 1908, that the water was not drinkabl
that is, "bad water." The springs at Badwater are ~
the lowest altitude-~280 feet below sea level-~of a~
in the United States. The lowest land-surface altitu~
282 feet below sea level, occurs in the saltpan at 2 poin
4 miles west and 3 miles northwest of the sprin~
The most prominent feature of Badwater is the lar
pool into which the springs discharge (fig. 11).  The
are two pools at Badwater, the second and smaller o
is about one-tenth of a mile north of the large pool a~
not so prominent. The total water-surface area of th~
two pools in January and April 1959 was about h~ 




3 mm thick and about 30 mm long; an occasional one
may be 40 mm long and only 1 mm thick. They are
hollow tubes, and many contain a drop or so of water.
Most of them lean or are bent in the direction of the last
strong wind.
   Another feature of the flood plains is the salt pools
which develop where the water table is shallow enough
to dissolve through the salt crust, giving rise to struc-
tures collapsed into the underlying pool for the most
part of salt-saturated water (fig. 37). They are most
abundant and best developed 5~~~ miles northwest of
Badwater, around the north end of the massive rock salt.

    
   COMPOSITION OF THE BRINES

   In general, the content of salts in the brines in Death
Valley increases panward, is greater in ground water
than in surface water, greater in dry years than in wet
years, and greater in standing water than in running
water. The increase in salts panward is due both to
evaporation of water and to re-solution of salts. Semi-
quantitative chemical analyses of the brines are given
in tables 50-52.
   The effect of the several variables on the composition
of the brines is illustrated by a series of graphs (figs.
38-50) representing suites of samples along ground-
water and surface-drainage courses into the pan.
   Differences in major constituents along a 5-mile
stretch of Salt Creek where it enters the pan are illus-
trated on figure 38. This graph illustrates the increase
in total salts panward and the increase in sodium and
potassium relative to calcium and magnesium. Car-
bonates were not determined in these brine samples, but
other analyses (table 34) indicate that along one stretch
of Salt Creek there is about a fifth as much bicarbonate


   A series of samples along a 3,000-foot traverse into
the northeast corner of Cottonball Basin, in the Salt
Springs area, is illustrated on figure 39. This graph
illustrates the panward increase in salts, but it also
shows that the ground water is more saline than surfac~
water at the same position in the pan. Later tests in
this same area indicate that the uppermost layer of
the ground water is more saline than deeper layers.
In February 1958, a few days after a rain, the uppermost
ground water, 3-4 inches below the surface, contained
4.3 percent dissolved solids, whereas ground water
bailed from 3~~~ feet contained only 2.5 percent.
   Springs used as a source of domestic water supplies
in the Furnace Creek area are located along faults on
the fans north of Furnace Creek Wash. Four major
sources are Travertine and Nevares Springs, and
springs in the bluffs near Cow Creek. Analyses of the
waters are given in table 35, page B73.
   The springs at Cow Creek probably are fed by
ground water underflow from the Nevares Springs;
the other springs are warm springs, and probably the
high temperatures are due to circulation at no great
depth but through warm rocks. The thermal gradient
in the ground in this highly faulted area probably i~
higher than average, and an increase of only 30~F
over the annual average temperature would heat the
water to the maximum observed (104~F). This could
be accomplished with circulation no deeper than about
1,500 feet (see p. B40).
   The water is believed to be moving into Death
Valley along faults in the Furnace Creek fault zone
and derived ultimately from the Pahrump Valley
(p. B38; see also Hunt and Robinson, 1960). This
water is very different from that on the west side of
Cottonball Basin, which probably moves in along faults
from Mesquite Flat (p. B37; see also Hunt and
Robinson, 1960).
   The total dissolved solids in these spring waters is
low compared to other Death Valley water; but by the

set has two cases for the composition of unit CHn that correspond to the
extremes that may be found at Yucca Mountain; either it is vitric with a
relatively high conductivity (the unit is then referred to as CHnv), or
it is zeolitized with a relatively low conductivity (the unit is then
referred to as CHnz).  The relative elevations of each of the units used
in the one-dimensional calculations (Figure 7) are based on the
stratigraphy of drill hole USW G-4, which is located on the eastern
boundary of the prospective repository location (Figures 1 and 2).  Unit
TSw3 is combined with TSw2 in this column because it is relatively thin
(~15 m) and has rock mass hydrologic properties similar to those of
TSw2. The combined unit is referred to as "TSw2-3".  These calculations
assume that the unit properties are constant throughout each unit.
	The percolation rate values listed in Table 2 span the range
suggested for the Yucca Mountain site under current conditions and under
currently postulated future scenarios (DOE, 1984).  As shown below, these
values also span the range over which water movement occurs only in the
matrix and in both the matrix and the fractures.  The cases having a 
percolation rate of 0.1 mm/yr have water movement only in the matrix
nearly everywhere in the column.  The 0.5-mm/yr problems have a
relatively small amount of water movement in the fractures in some
units.  The 4.0-mm/yr problems have considerable water movement in
fractures in some units (e.g., units TCw and TSw2-3).

the tin production now comes from placer deposits.
The "stream tin," which is derived from the weath-
ering of stockworks and lodes in granite and other
rocks, has accumulated in alluvial and eluvial de-
posits in a manner similar to gold.
  The stream tin is in the form of rounded pellets
of shot, bean, or nut size. Associated minerals are
similar pellets of limonite, hematite, magnetite, gar-
net, wolframite, tourmaline, and other placer min-
erals.
  The greatest tin placer deposits are those of Ma-
laysia (Table 13-2), where extensive alluvial depos-
its containing only half a pound of tinstone to the
cubic yard are worked by some of the largest
dredges in the world.
  The Indonesian tin deposits resulted from deep
trpoical weathering of granite containing lean stock-
works and sparse veinlets of quartz and cassiterite
giving rise to eluvial concentrations of cassiterite
(koelits) and of alluvial concentrations (kaksas) dur-
ing Quaternary time. An eluvial origin is indicated
by unworn cassiterite, in high concentration, along
with angular fragments of other resistant Indone-
sian minerals. These deposits contribute a consid-
erable part of the tin production (Table 13-2). They
are really a transient stage in the formation of the
alluvial tin placers because eventually the eluvial
material reaches the stream channels and there
undergoes rigorous stream concentration to form
the productive stream placers. During a slight sub-
sidence of the region in Quaternary time, when the
islands became separated from each other, the pay
streaks of tinstone became covered by subsequent
gravels and sands and the downstream parts be-
came submerged beneath the sea, so that former
stream gravels are now dredged from the sea bot-
tom.
  Small amounts of stream tin are also found in
Nigeria, China, Zaire, Bolivia, Thailand, Burma,
Victoria, New South Wales, and Tasmania. A triv-
ial amount was obtained as a by-product from gold
gravels in Alaska. About two-thirds of the world
supply of tin is obtained from placer deposits.
  See Chapter 21 for the history, production, uses,
and deposits of tin.

Precious Stones Placer Formation
Diamond. The diamond is the chief precious stone
found in placer deposits. Prior to 1871, when the
first diamond in primary rock was found at Kim-
berley, South Africa, the entire world production
came from placers in India and Brazil. About 95


feldspar-biotite-hornblende gneiss. It is suggested 
that the deposits have a syn- or pre-tectonic intru-
sive origin. Post ore folding has resulted in a vari-
able thickness of the ore. Widths range from about 
40 meters to less than 1 meter (Fig. 19-31).
   According to Valentine, the Pikwe ore body
forms an arcuate shape at the surface and has a
strike length of 3300 meters, which reduces below
to 400 meters. The deepest point of intersection of
the ore zone is 370 meters. The deposit can be
divided roughly into three zones: a southern mas-
sive plus 70 percent sulfide zone with grades up to
2.5 percent Ni and 1.5 percent Cu, enclosed in grey
gneisses; a central semimassive 40 to 70 percent 
sulfide zone underlaid with poorly mineralized host
amphibolite; and a northern low-grade 0.8 percent 
nickel and 0.8 percent copper zone of generally
disseminated ore with localized bands of massive 
sulfide distributed throughout the host amphibolite.  
and quartzitic rocks. The ore bodies follow the gen-
eral trend of the country rocks and the dips vary
from 90 degrees to 35 degrees south. There are 
structural similarities of these bodies to the dilatant
ore deposits of the Homestake deposits in South 
Dakota.
  The most important and abundant ore mineral is
sphalerite accompanied by some chalcopyrite and
galena. The largest zinc ore bodies are located at
the northern edge of the complex near the footwall
contact of quartzitic and dolomite-skarn rocks. The
structure of the deposits is complicatred due to
metamorphism, faulting, folding, and replacement
changes.
   The Ristonaho-Valisaari zinc ore body at Vihanti
is about 400 meters in length and 10-40 meters in
width. The composition of the zinc ore bodies is 7-
14 percent zinc, 0.5-0.8 percent copper, and 0.4-
0.7 percent lead with small amounts of silver and 
gold.
   The pyritic ores that are mined in the Outokumpu
deposits consist of pyrite, of course, but with vary-
ing amounts of pyrrhotite. Sphalerite and chalco-
pyrite ar~ present only in small quantities. Because 
of the complex nature of the ore mineralogy of
these deposits~ Finland is noted for her develop-
ment of large, efficient, automated smelters and
refineries. Their plants are sold, and constructed in
many different nations including Russia.
   Outokumpu Oy is a government-led company
whose capital stock amounts to 96 million Fmk.
The biggest shareholder is the Finnish state with 51
percent of the shares. Kansanelokelaitos (Old Age
Pensions Scheme) has about 49 percent, and 0.001
percent of the shares are owned by five other share-
holders.
   Each of the mines has its own distinctly unique
Sauna where civilized men enjoy the brisk beating
of their bodies with birch bundles collected even 
for their need in the winters. This is followed by
cooling-off with sausage and excellent beer, and
stimulating, intellectual, chit-chat.

Other Provinces. South America contains important
local lead-zinc deposits in Peru, Bolivia, and Ar-
gentina. Europe is fairly bountifully supplied with
lead and zinc. There is a Mediterranean province
with deposits in Spain, Roumania, Turkey, and
Tunisia; a central European province includes parts
of Czechoslovakia, Germany, Poland, and England.
A minor northern province has representatives in
Sweden, Norway, and Finland, and another one
lies in the Urals. Belts of abundant lead-zinc mi-

the boundary of Esmeralda and Nye Counties.
   The visible secondary copper minerals are mainly asso-
ciated with quartz veins at the Florence Mine, San
Antone district and at the Lodi, Reveille, Troy and Twin
River districts. Copper minerals are associated locally with
skarn in contact-metasomatized zones at the Fairplay,
Lodi, and Tonopah (Rays area) districts and with mafic
plugs and dikes at the Lodi district.  The minerals occur in
a shear zone in altered andesite at Ellendale district.  An
unusual copper deposit west of Duckwater near Brown
Summit, Pancake Range mining area, consists of anas-
tomosing veinlets, fracture fillings, and coatings of sec-
ondary minerals (chalcocite, cuprite, malachite, and a
little azurite) that cut and stain fractured Permian Ely
Limestone and Rib Hill Sandstone and sandy con-
glomerate (Newark Canyon Formation, pl. A1).  Quartz
veins are absent and alteration is weak.  Several properties
there have been explored by strippings and shallow cuts.
Modern exploration cuts near a very old shallow shaft of
unknown age with log cribbing appear not to have reach-
ed the Paleozoic strata that underlie most of the sur-
rounding area.  Copper-stained conglomerate (Newark
Canyon Formation, pl. A1) is exposed there near the axis
of an overturned syncline that involves the range for a
length of at least 9 miles (14.5 km).  These and other cop-
per prospects extend for about 1~~~ miles (2.4 km) along a 
narrow, north-trending zone generally just east of and
within several hundred yards of a major north-trending
normal fault.  The fault drops Permian Rib Hill Sand-
stone, Riepe Spring Limestone, and the Cretaceous
Newark Canyon Formation down on the east against Ely

Rattlesnake Canyon, Tybo district, Hot Creek Range,
has yielded a banded rhyolite (tuff?) suitable for
building and flagstone material (Kral, 1951, p. 194). A
small amount of stone was taken from the Miocene and 
(or) Pliocene Horse Camp Foundation of Moores (1964)
southeast of Currant, Nevada, but its disposition is
unknown. A Tertiary siliceous, tuffaceous siltstone and 
shaly siltstone unit, exhibiting liesegang bands on 
bedding surfaces, was quarried about 9 miles (14.4 km)
southwest of the Ellendale district for use in store fronts
(Painted Chief claim, Kral, 1951, p. 57). The strata are
thin-bedded, and the best material splits into slabs as
much as several inches thick.  The beds are considerably 
fractured, however, and most slabs seen were less than a
few feet across. When examined in July 1966, the
southernmost of two properties there was posted as the
Rainbow Placer claims. During barite mining just west
of Warm Springs, southern Hot Creek Range, Devo-
nian argillite and siltstone yielded minor amounts of
banded, iron-stained ornamental stone.  The major use
of the stone was not determined, but a very little was
made into carvings and sold in the store at Warm
Springs.
   A travertine deposit (RP-3, pl. B1) in limestone of the 
Triassic Luning Formation was being quarried in 
September 1965 in the Republic camp, Royston Hills 
area. As Kral (1951, p. 44-46) made no mention of the
deposit, it is believed to have opened after the date of 
his report. The travertine forms a series of pure-white
mammillary crustifications on the east wall of an
andesite(?) dike. The travertine deposit dips steeply
west, as does the Luning Formation, and it feathers into
limestone on the south. Its maximum outcrop dimen-
sions are 150 x 400 feet (46 x 122 m); the center part is
more pure and massive than its edges, which show
crustification and a greater tendency to split into mam-
millary fragments. The quarried material was cut and
polished into table tops and similar products. The
largest quarried block was nearly equidimensional and
measured 4 feet (1.2 m) on each side.

                  Fluorite

   The largest known deposits in northern Nye County
lie in two fluoritized areas, neither of which has yielded
more than several hundred tons of ore but both of
which may have large potential resources.  These two
widely separated areas, one in the Willow Creek district
and the other in the Union district, are the only places
where fluorite has been mined in northern Nye County
up to 1980. Hearsay reports indicate that the Hi Grade 
claims in Willow Creek district, Quinn Canyon Range,
may have been mined most recently (1970's) and may
have yielded several thousand tons of ore.  We wish to
emphasize that the Willow Creek district has the poten-
tial to become a major fluorspar mining area of the 
United States.  The numerous deposits in the Shoshone
Range, especially in the Union district, imply that this
area also may have considerable future potential. Little
specific data is available for the Shoshone deposits,
however, and which localities will be explored or what 
directions future development will take cannot be
ascertained.


   The observed fluorite in northern Nye County is
generally colorless, but locally it is not uncommon to
find white and purplish material; green fluorite was seen 
at the Nyco Mine, Willow Creek district.  The fluorite
commonly may be so finely crystalline as to have a
sugary texture, especially in some deposits in carbonate
rocks of the Willow Creek district, or it may be coarsely
crystalline, as in veins in volcanic rocks there and in
veins at property near Berlin, Union district.
   Claims in the Union district, Shoshone Range, are
under diverse ownership and have been developed and
explored by trenching and minor underground workings
(Kral, 1951, p. 203; Horton, 1961, p. 16-17).  The
fluorite deposits in the Willow Creek district have been
developed similarly to those in the Union district and
are also under diverse ownership. Fluorite has also been
reported or observed, but not mined, in the Paradise
Range.  The noteworthy large Kaiser (Baxter) fluorspar
mine described by Ross (1961, p. 77, 80, table 6.1) lies
near the Paradise Range on the north flank of the 
Monte Cristo Mountains just outside the county.
   The most common type of alteration associated with
the fluorite deposits, particularly those in the Willow
Creek district, is silicification, which affects both pre-
Tertiary strata and Tertiary volcanic rocks.  Massive
silicified zones are particularly conspicuous where Ter-
tiary welded tuff is the host rock.  Bleached and argil-
lized welded tuff is also common locally.
   Fluorite and sulfide deposits are spatially related in
the Shoshone Range, and pyrite is disseminated in the
wallrock of the fluorite veins at the Nyco Mine, Willow
Creek district.  Other fluorite deposits in the Willow
Creek district are mostly devoid of other ore minerals;
gangue is commonly silica and silicified, brecciated host
rock.  Besides occurring as veins and crystals lining
fracture surfaces and vugs in the Willow Creek, Union,
and Cloverdale districts, the fluorite in other deposits of
the Willow Creek district fills irregularly shaped
fracture zones.  Also, fluorite forms replacement bodies
in carbonate strata and silicified carbonate rocks in
the Willow Creek district and in the Union district
(Silberling, 1959, p. 12).  Some of the bodies in the
Willow Creek district are spatially and probably
genetically related to a northeast-trending acid porphyry
dike swarm that cuts the carbonate strata (Sainsbury
and Kleinhampl, 1969, pl. 1).
   All the fluorspar deposits in the Willow Creek district
are presumably Tertiary and related to volcanism, but
ages are not everywhere well documented.  The deposits
occur in either Tertiary volcanic rocks or Paleozoic car-
bonate strata; none has been noted in association with
granitic plutons. Fluorspar of the Union district com-
monly lies adjacent to steep faults in a host rock of
limestone of the Triassic Grantsville Formation.  Also,
fluoritized and silicified lenses occur in the Luning For-
mation along the Shoshone thrust and subsidiary shears
(Silberling, 1959, p. 12, 18).  The deposits were tentative-
ly considered mesothermal, presumably pre-Tertiary,
and they were excluded from a general north-trending
western epithermal fluorspar belt containing most of the
other fluorspar deposits of Nevada (Horton, 1964a,
p. 199-202).


mations of this rock have been recognized and mapped
by Messrs. Emmons and Garrey.  These formations are
not necessarily individual flows. Some of them are really
parts of a single thick flow, and others are certainly com-
posed of several flows. Intercalated between the rhyo-
lites are five flows of plagioclase basalt, one flow of 
quartz latite, some stratified tuffs, and finally capping the
series, a flow of quartz-bearing basalt. The effusive 
rocks are cut by intrusions of rhyolitic porphyry, plagio-
clase basalt, and leucite basanite. Most of the basalt
dikes occupy fault fissures.
  The Tertiary lavas and tuffs are generally conformable
to one another, but at a few places slight erosional un-
conformity has been detected.
  The entire series of volcanic rocks is divided by faults
into a large number of blocks in each of which the flows
are in general tilted to the east at angles up to 40~. The 
fault planes strike from northwest to northeast and dip
generally to the west.  The displacement as a general 
rule, is normal; that is, the hanging wall in each case
has slipped down relative to the foot wall.  In conse-
quence of this structure anyone traveling across the dis-
trict from west to east will see the edges of the same 
flows repeated again and again in the successive western
fronts of the ridges.

In regard to the veins they say:
    Most of the lodes are not simple veins, but are fissure
  zones (of nearly vertical dip) containing numerous vein-
  lets or stringers of vein material and in most cases show-
  ing no definite walls. The principal stringers are parallel
  with the sides of the lode as a whole, but they are linked 
  by numerous irregular cross veinlets, and similar small
  stringers extend for varying distances into the country
  rock. The lodes range in width from a few inches to 10
  or even 100 feet.
    Typical vein quartz, such as is characteristic of the
  gold veins of the Appalachians or Sierra Nevada or such
  as is found in the pre-Tertiary schists of the Bullfrog
  district, does not occur in the mines near Rhyolite, with
  the exception of the Original Bullfrog.  The quarts is
  prevailingly fine grained, often of a porcelain-like tex-
  ture, and is usually intercrystallized with calcite.


longest, is in about 200 feet. Place states that most of the work
has been done on a vein of white quartz, 1-3 feet wide, which
contains free gold and arsenopyrite.  He states that this vein can 
be traced for 4,300 feet. The present owner became interested
in the ground in 1932 and installed a small mill with which he 
milled 50 tons of the better dump rock.  He states that he recov-
ered about $450 and decided to stop his activity until he could 
become associated with someone having a better knowledge of
mining operations.
  A property commonly known as the Melbourn group, lies about
1 mile above the Colorado group on the northwest side of Willow
Creek. As previously mentioned, this property was discovered 
in 1913 and the high-grade found caused considerable excitement.
The ground was later sold to Ely interests and was known as the
Goodman property.  Hill states that the vein strikes N. 67~ W.
and dips 40-70~ S. It is 10-18 inches wide and consists of
crushed white quartz with a green talc along the seams.  The
values are largely in native gold which usually occurs in the talc.
The vein is in altered lime shale associated with an andesite dike.
It is reported that the ground was once leased by Cassidy and
Cater who produced about $25,000.  The property is reportedly
opened by several adits, the lower of which is known as the Good-
man tunnel.
  About 4 miles air line south of the Willow Creek properties is
a group of fluorite claims known as the Spar, reportedly owned
by A. F. W. Carlson and C. W. Jones of Bishop, California.  The
claims are estimated to be at an elevation of 8,000 feet.  They
are reached from the Adaven post office by traveling generally
southwest 12 miles to the Pine Creek ranch, then 6 miles up Pine
Creek.  Although a "Jeep" road of sorts has been built to within
a few hundred feet of the principal workings, it is necessary to
walk about one-half mile up this road.  The best fluorite was seen
at the lower workings where a short adit and winze have been
dug on a 5-foot width of high-grade spar occurring in a limestone
cliff.  Several short adits and cuts expose the same or a parallel
shear zone bearing westerly up a steep slope.  It appears that this
zone is along the south contact of a large rhyolite dike with the
limestone.  Faulting along this area has caused a slight ravine to
the ridge which is about 800 feet west of the lower adit.  The 
owners' sample returns show values ranging from 75 to 98.6
percent CaF2.  Several exposures were seen where high-grade
fluorite could be sorted from the softer waste rock.
  A property of unknown ownership, known as the Dresser Mine,

    Properties.  Old workings, possibly abandoned, include a 150-
foot inclined shaft and an old adit about 100-feet in length. The
shaft was sunk on the dip of a 4-foot quartz vein in rhyolite. It
appears that the work may have been started on near-surface
enrichment of oxidized silver minerals.  These enriched surface
ores were usually an incentive for deeper work.  A cabin on the
ground is in rehabilitable condition and indicates that the last
work here may have been done in the thirties.
  The Pittsburg group, owned by E. J. Reed and Ed Slavin of
Tonopah, is said to lie about 4 miles east of the Tolicha road and
the old workings of the Wilsons district. A mineralized zone lies
in and adjacent to several parallel quartz veins striking north-
east.  The values are in silver and gold.
  The workings include a 300-foot inclined shaft with 40 feet of
laterals on the 100-foot level, 175 feet on the 200, and 350 feet on
the 300- or bottom level.  Samples noted, indicate low silver values 
and some gold in the workings off the shaft.  A 425-foot adit is
said to show little indication of ore. 


the conglomerate progressively bevels the Aztec Sandstone, the Chinle For-
mation, and the Moenkopi Formation. Thick wedges of coarse conglom-
erate higher in the formation show by northward thinning and decreasing
coarseness that an important source was in an area to the south where vol-
canic rocks and related intrusive bodies now form the chief outcrops.

   Above the basal conglomerate the Thumb Formation consists of reddish
sandstone and siltstone, conglomerate, fresh-water limestone, gypsum, and
thin-bedded flagstone, with a total thickness of 2,000 to 3,000 feet. Basalt
flows and tuffaceous beds are included locally.  Numerous large lenses of
breccia, made up of Precambrian gneiss, schist, and granite, are seen at many
horizons of the section; these lenses are as much as 300 feet thick, and some
are more than half a mile long.  Probably they represent landsliding from
growing scarps south and east of the basin of deposition (Longwell, 1951,
p. 352). Toward the northeast, outcrops of the formation are interrupted
by a cover of younger deposits.
  
    Nothing analogous to the Overton Fanglomerate occurs in association
with the Thumb Formation.

Cretaceous(?) or Tertiary(?) System
   Overton Fanglomerate.  The Overton Fanglomerate as originally de-
fined (Longwell, 1921, p. 52) included the Willow Tank and Baseline For-
mations. Later (Longwell, 1949, p. 931), these formations were given sepa-
rate status and the name Overton Fanglomerate was restricted to the thick 
section of coarse deposits resting unconformably on the Baseline Sandstone
and older formations.  The redefined Overton, made up largely of carbon-
ate fragments derived from Paleozoic formations, has crude bedding in
which large blocks, many of them tens of feet long, have disordered arrange-
ment. It is steeply tilted to the east and has been bevelled by erosion through
its entire thickness, which at a maximum exceeds 2,000 feet. Apparently this 
coarse debris accumulated as coalescent fans in front of an advancing thrust
sheet, which moved eastward across a strongly folded belt.

   Southwest of Logandale the basal part of the formation, with average
thickness about 100 feet, consists of conglomerate made up of stream-worn
pebbles and cobbles.  This deposit grades upward into sandstone and silt-
stone, tan-colored and greenish, which locally contains small shells of gastro-
pods and fragments of fossil wood. This unit, more than 200 feet thick,
grades upward into a similar thickness of stream-laid gravel, which in turn
grades into coarse fan deposits as much as 1,500 feet thick. East of Glendale
these  deposits enclose a mass of Kaibab Limestone more than half a mile
long and fully a quarter of a mile from a possible source in bedrock. West
of Logandale an intact block of Mississippian limestone about 1,800 feet long,

are directly in contact with unsilicified country rock. Some of the
pay shoots are mere bunches or "pockets."  On the Velvet claim, for
example, several thousand dollars' worth of rich ore was found at the
surface, but efforts to find a continuation of this shoot in depth have
thus far been futile. The St. Ives, Simmerone, and Conqueror(Tonopah
Club) mines have had similar histories, although this in itself does not
warrant the conclusion that deeper ore bodies may not yet be found in
these properties. The Kendall mine at the time of visit had produced
about $100,000, all from ore within 60 feet of the surface, and the
deeper workings at that time showed no ore worth shipping. The
rich ore of the Sandstorm mine has all come from very irregular pay
shoots, which in many cases rest on flat floors of hard, barren, silicified


rhyolite. These bodies are usually
found at the intersection of later
cross fissures with the main silicified
ledge. Although some rich ore has
recently been opened at a depth of
100 feet, the bulk of the production
has come from ore within 50 feet of the
surface. The ore bodies first worked
in the Combination mine occurred in
short irregular shoots, most of them
at points of intersection of two or
more fissure zones and with a tendency
to a vertically elongated or pipelike
form. A sketch plan of one of these
shoots on level A is shown in fig. 8,
and in fig. 9 are represented plans of
shoots on the level below. At
greater depth these irregular pay
shoots appear to come together, and
on level D the deposit is lodelike,


with a length of about 250 feet. About 100 feet of this is shipping
ore, the rest being of milling grade.
  The so-called "No. 2 shoot" of the Combination mine is, with
the possible exception of the Jumbo pay shoot, the longest and most
regular body of ore known in the district, having been stoped on the
130-foot or B level (fig. 9) for over 300 feet. Moreover, it is separated
by only a short, barren interval from the Reilly ore body, which is
on the same line of fissuring. This pay shoot is the hanging-wall
portion of a shattered silicified ledge, 30 to 40 feet wide, which
strikes northwest and dips northeast at angles ranging from 75~ to
80~. The ore, which is up to 6 feet in width, has no walls and
can not always be distinguished by the eye from the barren or
low-grade ledge matter. It lies near, but not always in contact


   Salinity Studies.-~Salinity measurements of the fluid inclusions in Pennine
minerals were made on a freezing stage consisting of a hexagonal aluminum
cell with a circular inner wall, around which were placed six thermomodules 
connected in series. The heat generated on the hot side of the thermomodules
was removed by circulating pre-cooled tap water through copper plates
clamped to the thermomodules. The aluminum cell was fitted with quartz
windows at top and bottom and a thermocouple placed in the cell in close
proximity to the sample, which was supported in the center of the cell. The
entire system was insulated and the cell filled with acetone. It was found that
~pplication of a current of 10 amps to the thermomodules resulted in a tempera-
ture of -18~ C within the cell, and that above -18~ C it was possible to
adjust the temperature in the cell within ~~ 1~ C by varying the current fed
to the thermomodules. Unfortunately it was not possible to obtain tempera-
tures lower than about -18~ C with this freezing stage. The stage was
calibrated by measuring the melting temperature of n-dodecane (M.P.


-9.6~ C) sealed in glass capillary tubes, and by placing the bulb of a ther-
mometer adjacent to the thermocouple in the cell.
   Fluid inclusions generally exhibit considerable super-cooling before freez-
ing (33), consequently each specimen was pre-cooled in a mixture of dry ice 
and acetone for 30 minutes and then rapidly transferred to the cooling stage
which was at a temperature of -18~ C. By gradually increasing the tem-
perature within the cell, the temperature at which the last ice crystal in an
~~clusion melted could be obtained. These last melting temperatures have 
~~en interpreted in terms of the system NaCl-H2O (Table 3). In some 
~~stances it was found that the ice crystals in inclusions had already melted
at -18~ C. In such cases it has only been possible to place a minimum value 
on the salinity of the inclusion contents.
   Investigation of the Na/K ratios of Fluid Inclusions.-~In order to measure 
the relative amounts of Na and K in Pennine fluid inclusions samples of
quartz, fluorite, sphalerite and barite exceeding 100 grams in weight were
carefully cleaned and then crushed in a clean tungsten-carbide mixer mill for

    5. The geographic area to which any
resource/reserve estimate refers must be defined.
    6. All estimates must show a date and author.
    7. The reserve base is an encompassing 
resource category delineated by physical and
chemical criteria. A major purpose for its recogni-
tion and appraisal is to aid in long-range public and
commercial planning. For most mineral com-
modities, different grades and tonnages, or other 
appropriate resource parameters, can be specified 
for any given deposit or area, or for the Nation,
depending on the specific objectives of the 
estimators; therefore, the position of the lower
boundary of the reserve base, which extends into 
the subeconomic category, is variable, depending
on those objectives. The intention is to define a 
quantity of in-place material, any part of which 
may become economic, depending on the extrac-
tion plans and economic assumptions finally used.
When those criteria are determined, the initial 
reserve-base estimate will be divided into three
component parts: reserves, marginal reserves, and
a remnant of subeconomic resources. For the pur-
pose of Federal commodity assessment, criteria for
the reserve base will be established for each com-
modity.
    8. Undiscovered resources may be divided in ac-
cordance with the definitions of hypothetical and
speculative resources, or they may be divided in
terms of relative probability of occurrence.
    9. Inferred reserves and the inferred reserve
base are postulated extensions of reserves and of
the reserve base. They are identified resources
quantified with a relatively low degree of certainty.
Postulated quantities of resources not based on
reserve/reserve-base extensions, but rather on
geologic inference alone, should be classified as un-
discovered.
    10. Locally, limited quantities of materials may
be produced, even though economic analysis has in-
dicated that the deposit would be too thin, too low
grade, or too deep to be classified as a reserve. This
situation might arise when the production facilities 
are already established or when favorable local cir-
cumstances make it possible to produce material 
that elsewhere could not be extracted profitably.
Where such production is taking place, the quanti-
ty of in-place material shall be included in the
reserve base, and the quantity that is potentially
producible shall be included as a reserve. The 
profitable production of such materials locally,
however, should not be used as a rationale in other


Mesozoic siliceous and volcanic rocks and Tertiary volcanic rocks.
On the other hand, eastern Nevada is underlain largely by Pre-
cambrian metamorphic and sedimentary rocks and Paleozoic car-
bonate rocks locally covered by Tertiary volcanic rocks (Nolan, 1943,
1962).
  These differences in rock types of western and eastern Nevada must
reflect fundamental differences within the crust, which are further
reflected in the distinctive metal suites of the two areas. Western
and eastern Nevada accordingly are two distinct metallogenic prov-
inces (see fig. 12); western Nevada contains the major gold, silver,
tungsten, antimony, mercury, and iron deposits thus far discovered
(Ferguson, 1944; Nolan, 1950). Eastern Nevada contains the major
lead and zinc deposits with associated gold and silver deposits.
  The division between the two provinces is not a sharp line, but
rather a broad transitional zone that follows along the 117~ meridian
in southern Nevada, and swings northeastward to the 115~ meridian
in the northern part of the State (fig. 12). Deposits within the transi-
tional zone include representatives of both provinces; likewise, in
eastern Nevada, the base metal deposits are ringed by precious metal
and antimony zones. Major copper deposits may be found in both
provinces; evidently copper is not so directly related to crustal rock
type but may be derived from sources below the crust within the
mantle. The sources of metals and their mode of transport upward
are yet not clearly understood.
  Within the two metallogenic provinces in Nevada, regional struc-
tural and lithologic controls were important in localizing districts and
ore bodies. On figures 13 and 14 it appears that a number of districts
are localized along northwest and northeast trends. These mineral
belts in Nevada have been discussed briefly by Roberts (1957, 1960).
One extends from Battle Mountain to Eureka; along this belt (Roberts,
1960, p. 18) detailed mapping has shown that the major ore bodies
occur in windows of carbonate rocks through the upper plate of the
Roberts Mountains thrust and in association with intrusive rocks
(fig. 14). The windows represent domal uplifts that began in the
Pennsylvanian and were accentuated during intrusive activity in
Mesozoic or early Tertiary time. The northwest alinement of win-
dows and associated ore deposits suggests some major structural con-
trol for both the domal uplifts and mineral belts. Except for the
arching, no displacement is noted along the belt; moreover, the 
Paleozoic and Mesozoic facies do not seem to be displaced along the
belts and it is therefore inferred that the belts are ancient structural
features that may be of Precambrian age.
  Metallization along the belts varies considerably in type and kind.
In the Battle Mountain-Eureka belt, for example, ore deposits in the
Osgood Mountains area, 35 miles northwest of Battle Mountain,
include gold, mercury, and tungsten deposits; at Battle Mountain,
copper, gold, and lead-zinc-silver deposits; at Cortez, silver, lead, and
zinc deposits, and at the Buckhorn district, 6 miles east of Cortez,
gold deposits (Vanderburg, 1938; H. Masursky, oral communication,
1963). These occurrences may reflect zoning of metals, different metal-
logenic provinces, metallization at different times, or different levels of
erosion. The tungsten and mercury deposits in the Osgood Moun-
tains are characteristic of the western metallogenic province; the silver-
lead-zinc deposits at Battle Mountain and Cortez are characteristic


  The Pansy-Lee mine (No. 41) in the Krum Hills (secs. 1 and 12,
T. 36 N., R. 36 E.), 11 miles northwest of Winnemucca, in Humboldt
County, also has produced antimony as a byproduct.  However, un-
like the Potosi mine and Arabia district above, tetrahedrite is the only
primary antimony mineral present. Approximately 200 tons of
antimony have been recovered from lead-zinc-copper ores mined from
veins that strike N. 20~ E. to N. 50~ W. and vary from a few inches to
several feet in width. They consist mainly of quartz with lesser
amounts of calcite, tetrahedrite, sphalerite, galena, pyrite, arseno-
pyrite, and yellow antimony oxides. Concentrates shipped in 1942
averaged 2 percent antimony, 0.6 ounces of gold and 50 to 60 ounces o
silver per ton, in addition to the lead, zinc, and copper. The wallrock
is slate.
  The Antimony King mine (No. 3) in Bernice Canyon (sec. 23, T. 22
N., R. 37 E.) on the west flank of the Clan Alpine Range in Churchill
County produced approximately 175 tons of antimony mainly during
both World Wars. A 2- to 48-inch quartz vein, striking N. 10~ to 25~
E. and dipping 55~ W., roughly parallels a highly brecciated latitic (?)
sill, in some places following the hanging wall and elsewhere following
the footwall. The sill intrudes shale and limestone of the Triassic
Star Peak Formation. Pods, blebs, and veinlets of stibnite occur in
the quartz vein and in the silicified and sercitized sill. Some arseno-
pyrite, pyrite, and sphalerite are associated with the stibnite. In the
immediate vicinity of the Antimony King mine, the I.H.X. and Ar-
rance mines (No. 3) have produced some 50 tons of antimony from
quite similar deposits along this sill, and a second parallel sill.
  The Last Chance mine (No. 62) on the divide (sec. 17, T. 10 N.,
R. 42 E.) between Wall and San Pablo Canyons, on the east flank of
the Toiyabe Range, Nye County, produced 192 tons of antimony
during World War I and II. Several veins, consisting of brecciated
wall rock, gouge, some quartz, calcite, stibnite, and pyrite, and minor
tetrahedrite, cut highly contorted Permian(?) limestone and shale. 
The main vein strikes N. 70~ E. and dips 45~ to 55~ NW. Several
rhyolite porphyry dikes intrude the sedimentary rocks.
  The Cottonwood Canyon mine (No. 42) in Little Cottonwood
Canyon, (sec. 35, T. 32 N., R. 43 E. and sec. 2, T. 31 N., R. 43 E.),
on the east flank of Antler Peak, in Lander County, has produced
156 tons of antimony. A main vein with several splits strikes N.
15~ to 30~ E. and dips 45~ to 80~ W. in a north-trending fault zone
cutting Mississippian argillite, shale, quartzite, and chert. A quartz-
porphyry dike intrudes the sediments. East-trending faults offset both
the fault zone and vein. The vein is up to 48 inches wide, and con-
tains abundant quartz and gouge, with some calcite, stibnite, and
pyrite.
  Antimony occurrences that have produced less than a hundred tons
are shown on figure 16 and described by Lawrence (1963). Several
are of special interest because of unusual features or associations.
At the Oreana (Little Tungsten) mine (No. 80), south of Rocky
Canyon (sec. 3, T. 29 N., R. 33 E.) on the western flank of the Hum-
boldt Range, Pershing County, rare native antimony is associated
with scheelite and beryl in a quartz-oligoclase-albite-phlogopite
pegmatite body. At Steamboat Springs (No. 98), 10 miles south of
Reno in Washoe County, stibnite and "metastibnite" occur with


  PRODUCTION AND OUTLOOK

  Nevada is the fifth largest gold-producing State, with a total output 
of 27,057,000 ounces from 1859 to 1962. The State ranked seventh
in production in 1962, when only 62,863 ounces were mined.
  The gold mining industry in Nevada exemplifies the general trend
of gold production in the United States, which has steadily declined
from a high of more than 4.5 million ounces in 1940 to 1.5 million
ounces in 1962 (U.S. Bureau of Mines preliminary data), the lowest
peacetime output since 1884. This may be contrasted with the world
gold production of 50 million ounces in 1962, a record high. Factors
responsible for diminishing production of gold in the United States are
the gradual depletion of high-grade deposits and constantly increasing
costs under a fixed selling price of $35 per ounce. As a result of this
situation, a steadily increasing portion of domestic gold output is a
byproduct of base metal mines.
  Figure 24 shows Nevada's gold-mining history since 1880 in terms
of annual production. Most of the bonanza production of the Com-
stock (No. 67, fig. 23) occurred before systematic annual records were
kept; consequently, the impact of this district cannot be shown. The
high production from 1906 to 1916 is due mainly to the tremendous
output of Goldfield (No. 12) during this period. After the decline of
Goldfield, gold mining generally waned in the 1920's and early 1930's,
but during this period there occurred a marked transition in the source
of gold from predominantly gold-bearing lodes to byproduct gold,
mainly from the copper ores of Ely (No. 70). With the increase in
the price of gold from $20.67 to $35 per ounce in 1934, interest in gold
mining was renewed, and many lode districts were reopened. The
large output of the Getchell mine in Potosi district (No. 25) is re-
flected in the peak of almost 400,000 ounces in 1940. The post-World
War II period has been one of general diminishing activity, marked
by short-lived spurts of production due to large-scale placer operations
at Round Mountain (No. 57), large-scale open pit mining at the
Goldacres pit in the Bullion district (No. 29), and at the Getchell
mine (No. 25), in addition to significant sustained amounts of by-
product gold from Ely.
  Under current high costs, plus the fixed price of gold, a revival of
gold mining in Nevada comparable to the 1906-16 era hardly seems
likely. The known rich bonanza ore bodies are, for the most part,
exhausted. Any significant increase in gold output will probably be
either from byproduct gold or from large-scale mining of low-grade
lode or placer gold deposits. Rejuvenation of silver and silver-lead
mining in such districts as Comstock, Tonopah, and Eureka, or a
sharp increase in copper output at Ely would most certainly boost gold
production to several times its current rate.
  The closing of the Goldacres open pit mine in 1961 marked the
end of significant production from lode gold mines in Nevada; how-
ever, the recent resumption of activity at the Getchell mine in the
Potosi district may very well herald a new approach to gold mining
wherein high costs are combated by bold and imaginative planning
and a willingness to invest in and develop techniques for mining large
low-grade ore bodies, for extracting gold and all useful byproducts
from complex ores, and for exploring for concealed ore bodies.

FIG. 1.-~(CONTINUED).

  The piezometric surface of an aquifer is an imaginary surface that
everywhere coincides with the static level of the water in the aquifer.
It is the surface to which the water from a given aquifer will rise under
its full head (figs. 11 and 12). If at any given place the water from
different depths in the aquifer will rise to different levels the aquifer
has more than one piezometric surface. 
  An isopiestic line of an aquifer is a contour of the piezometric surface
of the aquifer. It is an imaginary line all points along which have
the same static level. Its position may be described in any con-
venient unit and with reference to any convenient datum, but is
most commonly expressed in feet or meters above mean sea level.
A piestic interval is the difference in static level between two isopiestic
lines. (See fig. 12.)


  The hydraulic gradient, or pressure gradient, of an aquifer at a given
place in a given direction is the rate of change of pressure head per
unit of distance at that place and in that direction.  If the direction
is not mentioned it is generally understood that the direction of
maximum rate of change is meant. If the rate of change is uniform
between two points the hydraulic gradient between these points is
the ratio of the difference in the static level between the points to the
horizontal distance between them. The hydraulic gradient can be
expressed in percentage, in feet per mile, or in other ways.
  A hydraulic profile of an aquifer is a vertical section of its piezo-
metric surface.
  Ground water may be said to have artesian, normal, or subnormal
pressure or pressure head, according as its static level is above the
upper surface of the zone of saturation, at this surface, or below this
surface (fig. 11).


if the two flanks of a basin are of low relief, ~
that there are no local systems, the bulk of t~

line and the valley bottom and only a small po~
tion will appear as baseflow.
  9. A further consequence of the theory 
that the water levels at shallow depths are t~
most affected by seasonal recharge and d~
charge. The small intake and outlet areas of t~
intermediate and regional zones prevent t~
water levels from fluctuating widely. Plotnik~
and Bogomolov [1958, p. 90] make a distin~
tion between two zones on the basis of fluctu~
tion of the water levels. They call the first `zo~
of oscillations of underground water levels.' A~
cording to them the volume of water that occ~
pies the zone of oscillation undergoes season
variations. This volume would control groun~
water discharge and therefore they call it `co~
trol reserves of underground waters.' Their se~
ond zone includes all the water that is below th
zone of oscillation, both that in the deeper, st~
homogeneous parts of the basin and that i
artesian aquifers; these are the `secular r~
sources.' It seems that the `zone of oscillatio~

  It seems likely that with certain adsorbates (e.g. saturated hydrocarbons)
on metals, the electrostatic contribution may actually constitute the major
portion of the total adsorption energy (ca 5~00 kcal mole-1); but with non-
polar molecules adsorbed on insulators it is probably quite small (e.g. for
argon on potassium chloride, U(~) is probably about 0~250 kcal mole-1)
except on particularly active spots such as the edges or corners of crystals,
or regions of crystal imperfection.
  From consideration of equation (1.7) it is clear that if adsorption involves
predominantly dispersion forces, the adsorption energy will be numerically
high in crevices and pores of the solid, where each adsorbate molecule is
close to an enhanced number of atoms of the solid. Calculations by de Boer
and Custers(29) showed that the maximum enhancement is to be expected
in long and narrow capillaries and in small spherical cavities; and that the
interaction potential has its lowest value for a molecule situated on the top
of a projection. Adsorption should therefore occur preferentially in the
smallest pores of the solid.
  The picture is different, however, if the electrostatic contribution is
considerable and the face of the crystal is heterionic (i.e. if positive and
negative ions alternate there, as in the 100 face of potassium chloride). Within
a narrow pore the alternating positive and negative charges will tend to
compensate each other so that the electrostatic field will be weakened
whereas on a prominence the cancellation effect will be much less~. Thus
the dispersion and electrostatic potentials will be affected in opposite senses
by the prominences and depressions, so that the force field over the surface
as a whole will tend to be smoothed out: the tendency of the adsorbate
molecules to seek out the fine pores and to shun the prominences will be
diminished.

Adsorption Forces-~Conclusion

The general picture which emerges from our consideration of physical
adsorption forces acting between a solid and a molecule of adsorbate gas or
vapour, is somewhat as follows: dispersion forces are always present and,
unless the adsorbate molecule possesses a strong dipole moment, will
represent the major contribution to the total energy of adsorption. Their
dependence on distance is such that the first layer of adsorbed molecules will
be strongly held, and higher layers more weakly so with an energy not much

to 0~12 for C6H6 at 20~; and 0~002 to 0~12 for n-hexane at 20~C. At very low
pressures the values of p/[x(po-p)] were higher, i.e. the amount adsorbed
was lower, than those calculated by the BET equation.
  Figure 2.9 refers to the data of MacIver and Emmett(18), for the adsorp-
tion of nitrogen on pure sodium chloride; as is seen the straight line portion
of the BET plot covers a relative pressure range of 0~01 to 0~1. The point
where the adsorption has the value x~, (calculated from the plot) lies at a
relative pressure of ~0~05. MacIver and Emmett aver that with uniform
or nearly uniform surfaces the adsorption measurements must be extended
below the "normal" BET range (0~05 < p/po < 0~35) otherwise the BET
plot may give a negative intercept.

  In view of the importance of the value of parameter c in the present context,
values for various solids are quoted in Table 2.22. The systems near the top
of the table will tend to have an ill-defined point B with consequent uncer-
tainty in the monolayer capacity. On the other hand, the systems near the
bottom of the table where the values of c are high will tend to show strong
localization so that the value of Am will depend greatly on the nature of the
adsorbent, in extreme cases being determined by the lattice parameters of the
solid.
  The use of krypton to determine the surface area of evaporated metal
films, which has become widespread in recent years(87-94), is attended by
complications arising out of the difficulty of extending the measurements over
a sufficiently wide range of relative pressure. A clear point B has been
reported by Brennan et al.(99) at very low relative pressure (~0~01), and a
moderately well-defined point B has been found by other workers(88, 89), in
the usual range of relative pressure (around 0~1). What is not clear so far is
whether, on one and the same system, both of these points would be found
thus in effect giving rise to a step-wise isotherm.
  Until further knowledge is accumulated caution is called for in estimating
the surface areas of evaporated metal films by krypton adsorption(94).

  Pressure readings, in terms of liquid head, are obtained by
connecting the piezometers through a manifold to an
inclined manometer, as shown photographically in figure 2
and schematically in figure 3. Differences in pneumatic head
between each piezometer and the atmosphere are made by
opening the manifold valve connecting that piezometer to
the manometer, all the other manifold valves being closed.
Zero manometer readings are obtained by opening the
manifold to atmosphere. The change in atmospheric
pressure during the test is measured with a microbarograph
and (or) a surveying altimeter.
  Under field conditions, a manometer inclined at a 10:1
slope and filled with fluid of specific gravity 1.20 (commer-
cial manometer fluid for outdoor use) has been found to give
readings accurate to about 0.25 mm (0.01 inch), which is
equivalent to about 30 mm (0.1 foot) of pneumatic head. A
760 mm (30-inch) manometer, having a range of 76 mm (3
inches) is adequate to measure pneumatic head differences
under most conditions. Because downhole pneumatic head
will sometimes be less than that at land surface, it is desirable
to establish, by slightly overfilling the manometer-fluid
reservoir, a reading of about 13 mm (0.5 inch) at zero


                    DATA OBTAINED

  Data required for the method include curves or tables of
pneumatic head versus time at each depth during a period
when atmospheric pressure is changing. During the in-
vestigation, it was found to be most convenient to obtain
these data during a normal afternoon barometric decline. In
most of the areas where tests were run, such a pressure
decline usually is equivalent to 3 to 4 millibars or about 30 to
36 m of pneumatic head in 4 to 5 hours. Generally, when
determining the downhole response to diurnal barometric
changes, differences in pneumatic head between each depth
and land surface are measured in terms of liquid head at
about 15-minute intervals. Readings generally are started at
about 10 or 11 a.m., when the barometer is normally quite
stable, as such readings provide good initial conditions for
the analysis. The readings generally are continued through
the afternoon decline until 6 or 7 p.m., when a diurnal
barometric rise normally occurs.
  For electric-analog analysis, the measured pneumatic
head differences are added algebraically to the absolute
pneumatic head, as determined from a microbarograph or
an altimeter. The resultant pneumatic head values can be
plotted versus time to produce a family of curves (fig. 4), one
curve for each piezometer and one for atmospheric pressure.


To apply equation 9, the arithmetic average clay content was
determined from data on all of the samples collected and
tested from a given layer. This average value was used to
represent CMC in the equation. Use of the arithmetic
average was arbitrary, and may not be completely ap-
propriate because it assigns too little weight to the effects of
wetting on the discrete clay layers within each interval.
However, the worth of the correction for the effects of
wetting would be questionable no matter what averaging
scheme was used.
	Results of applying equation 9 to compute corrected
hydraulic conductivities are listed in table 4. The results
appear reasonable for the top two layers, but not for the
bottom four layers. Moreover, the apparent agreement
between the corrected air-permeability results and the
recharge-based hydraulic conductivity for the surface layer
may be fortuitous. The surface layer probably is indeed more
sensitive to the effects of wetting than the deeper layers, as
described above. However, the laboratory-based correction
factor was determined on samples mainly collected at depth,
and thus is not necessarily relevant for the surface layer data.
Agreement of the corrected air-permeability-based
hydraulic conductivity with the recharge-based value for the
8-15-meter layer also seems fortuitous, as the massive caliche
in this zone should not be structurally affected by wetting.
	Failure of the correction scheme to improve the
air-permeability-based hydraulic conductivity estimates for
the bottom four layers may result from flow occurring
through secondary porosity features, such as cracks and
joints, rather than through the intergranular porosity. Thus
the laboratory results, which include effects of wetting on
permeability related to intergranular porosity only, might
not be relevant.
	Additional experience with the air-permeability technique
will be needed to reconcile whether, or under what con-
ditions, a correction for the effects of wetting is warranted
for layers at depth. On the other hand, sufficient experience
has been gained to indicate that Ke values of the near-surface
materials generally would need to be corrected for the effects
of wetting. Such a correction could be practically developed
if the ratio of air-permeability-based to recharge-based
hydraulic conductivity could be correlated with some readily
measurable property of the near-surface materials.

	COMPARISON OF RESULTS WITH LABORATORY DATA

	As described above, a number of sequential laboratory
analyses of air permeability at the prevailing moisture


1963 (see Table 2) and is not included in the consumptive use shown. Water
added to the tanks was adjusted for changes in soil moisture during the month.
The depth to water was held between 5 and 6 ft below land surface.
   As a result of the general increase of vegetation in each of the tanks,
water use during 1964 greatly exceeded that used during 1963. The pattern of
vegetation development was not the same for each tank, however, so the rela-
tion between data for pairs of individual tanks was continually changing. In
1965, the plants were approaching maturity, and the volume of vegetation
increased only slightly.
   A search of the literature indicated that water-use data for arrowweed
were lacking prior to the current studies at Yuma. The data now available
indicate that under favorable conditions, arrowweed will use as much water
as saltcedar, which has long been known for its high rate of water use.
   Saltbush.-~Quailbrush (Atriplex lentiformis) was grown in tanks 1 and 2,
and four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens) was grown in tank 3. The salt-
bush was established both by transplanting and seeding. Depth to water was
held at 3 to 4 ft below land surface, in 1962, and nearly constant at 5.5 ft
during 1963 and 1964.
   The quailbrush made most of its growth during 1963, the average volume
of the two tanks increasing from 1,050 cu ft in December, 1962, to 5,650 cu
ft in October, 1963. Although the average volume of vegetation increased to
6,240 cu ft by September, 1964, and 7,030 by August 6, 1965, the volume of
foliage actively transpiring may have been less (see Fig. 3). Growth in tank
1 was more vigorous than in tank 2 during 1964. The consumptive use, shown
in Table 8, does not include precipitation but is adjusted for soil-moisture
changes during the month.
   Four-wing saltbush, grown in tank 3, is smaller and slower in growth than
quailbrush. This plant will exist as a xerophyte, but appears to grow and pro-
duce seed only when moisture is sufficient to meet minimum needs. The
greatest growth of vegetation in the tank was made during 1963, when the
volume increased from 1,290 to 2,290 cu ft. The volume was 2,770 cu ft on
September 24, 1964, and 3,080 on August 6, 1965. The water use, shown in
Table 8 and Fig. 4, was significantly less during 1964 and 1965, essentially
because of the maturation of the plants.
   Cattail.-~Cattail grows to maturity and dies each season. In the Yuma
area, growth begins in March and ends in July; vegetation begins to dies in
October and usually is dry by December. The tanks for cattail were set well
within an extensive area of similar vegetation. Cattail transplanted late in
the 1961 growing season made little growth during the remainder of the year.
During 1962 and following years, however, the cattail grew normally in th~
tanks, attaining an average height of 6 to 7 ft each year.
   Water was added to the tanks at least twice each week, reestablishing th~
water level at a point 2 to 4 in. above the roots of the plants. Water w~~
changed once each week to prevent the accumulation of salts. Except for ~~~
vegetation in tank 3 during 1964, as will be explained subsequently, cat~~~~~
in the tanks blended well with that of the surrounding area (see Fig. 5).
   Consumptive use from tank 1 showed no progressive increase or decre~~~
during the 3 yr, as indicated by Table 9 and Fig. 6. The appearance o~~~~~
vegetation was about the same each year. The condition of the vegeta~~~~~~~
tank 2 was noticeably improved during 1964 relative to previous years, ~~~ 
the higher use from this tank during 1964 is associated with this change. ~~~

is that they have a high degree of directionality, which is conferred by the
characteristic arrangement of the bonding orbitals of the hydrogen and
oxygen atoms (Fig. 3.1). Hydrogen bonds also possess a specific bond
length, which differs from one type of H bond to another, depending on the
structural geometry and the electron distribution in the molecules involved.
In ice, each water molecule is hydrogen-bonded: the length of the hydrogen
bond is 1.77 ~~. Hydrogen bonds, therefore, form and remain stable only
under specific geometrical conditions.
  Water is of course not the only substance capable of hydrogen bonding.
Ammonia, hydrogen fluoride, and alcohols also exhibit hydrogen bonds
(i.e., exposed hydrogen nuclei in these compounds are attracted by concen-
trations of negative charges on adjacent molecules). Molecules of many
compounds, in fact, are so structured that one part has an excess of positive
and the other part an excess of negative charges. All such molecules are
called polar, since they act somewhat like minute magnets and are charac-
terized by a dipole moment (a measure of the tendency of a polar molecule to
be affected by an electrical or magnetic field). The uniqueness of water lies in
the ease with which its molecules form extended, three-dimensional hy-
drogen-bonded aggregates.


D. States of Water

  In the vapor or gaseous state, water molecules are largely independent of
one another and occur mostly as monomers signified as (H2O)1 . Occasionally,
colliding molecules may fuse to form dimers, (H2O)2, or even trimers,
(H2O)3, but such combinations are rare.
  In the solid state, at the other extreme, a rather rigidly structured lattice
forms with a tetrahedral configuration (Fig. 3.2) which can be schematically
represented as sheets of puckered hexagonal rings (Fig. 3.3). In actual fact,
as many as nine alternative structures, or ice forms, can occur when water
freezes, depending on prevailing temperature and pressure conditions which
can be charted in phase diagrams. Figure 3.3 pertains to ice I, the familiar
form which occurs and is stable at ordinary atmospheric pressure.
  The orderly structure of ice does not totally disappear in the liquid state1,
as the molecules do not become entirely independent of one another. The
polarity and hydrogen bonds continue to bond water molecules together,
 

where ~s is the average particle density.
  Bulk density is generally measured by means of a core sampler designed to
extract "undisturbed" samples of known volume from various depths in the
profile. An alternative is to measure the volumes and masses of individual
clods (not including interclod cavities) by immersion in mercury or by coating
with paraffin wax prior to immersion in water. Still other methods are the
sand-funnel and balloon techniques used in engineering, and gamma-ray
attenuation densitometry (Blake, 1965).
  Pore-size distribution measurements can be made in coarse-grained soils
by means of the pressure-intrusion method (Diamond, 1970), in which a
nonwetting liquid, generally mercury, is forced into the pores of a predried
sample. The pressure is applied incrementally, and the volume pentrated by
the liquid is measured for each pressure step, equivalent (by the capillary
theory) to a range of pore diameters. In the case of fine-grained soils, capillary
condensation methods, or, more commonly, desorption methods are used
(Vomocil, 1965). In the desorption method, a presaturated sample is sub-
jected to a stepwise series of incremental suctions, and the capillary theory
is used to obtain the equivalent pore-size distribution. Water is commonly
used as the permeating liquid, though nonpolar liquids have also been tried
in an attempt to assess, by the comparison, the possible effect of water satura-
tion and desorption in modifying soil structure. Where the aggregates are
fairly distinct, it is sometimes possible to divide pore-size distribution into
two distinguishable ranges, namely macropores and micropores. The macro-
pores are mostly the interaggregate cavities which serve as the principal
avenues for the infiltration and drainage of water and for aeration. The
micropores are the intraaggregate capillaries responsible for the retention of
water and solutes. However, the demarcation is seldom truly distinct, and
the separation between macropores and micropores is often arbitrary.
  The shapes of aggregates observable in the field (illustrated in Fig. 6.5) can
be classified as follows:

  (1) Platy: Horizontally layered, thin and flat aggregates resembling
wafers. Such structures occur, for example, in recently deposited clay soils.
  (2) Prismatic or columnar: Vertically oriented pillars, often six sided,

G. Hydraulic Conductivity, Permeability, and Fluidity


  The hydraulic conductivity, again, is the ratio of the flux to the hydraulic
gradient, or the slope of the flux versus gradient curve (Fig. 8.8).
  With the dimensions of flux being LT-~1, those of hydraulic conductivity
depend on the dimensions assigned to the driving force (the potential
gradient). In the last chapter, we showed that the simplest way to express the
potential gradient is by use of length, or head, units. The hydraulic head
gradient H/L, being the ratio of a length to a length, is dimensionless.7
Accordingly, the dimensions of hydraulic conductivity are the same as the
dimensions of flux, namely LT-~1. If, on the other hand, the hydraulic
gradient is expressed in terms of the variation of pressure with length, then
the hydraulic conductivity assumes the dimensions of M-1L3T. Since the
latter is cumbersome, the use of head units is generally preferred.
  In a saturated soil of stable structure, as well as in a rigid porous medium
such as sandstone, for instance, the hydraulic conductivity is characteris-
tically constant. Its order of magnitude is about 10-2-~10-3 cm/sec in a
sandy soil and 10-4-~10-7 cm/sec in a clayey soil.


wherein, as previously defined, the convective flux of the solution q is equal to
the product of average velocity and volume fraction of the solution; i.e.,
q = ~~~.
  The adsorption of ions in the soil can be positive, as is the attachment of
cations to clay surfaces, or negative, as is the repulsion or partial exclusion
of anions from the electrostatic double layer of the same clay. This, inciden-
tally, is why anions in a solution tend to travel somewhat faster than cations
when an electrolytic solution is passed through a soil, as the cations undergo
exchange phenomena within the soil's cation exchange complex and are
retarded in the process. If the attainment of equilibrium between the ions in
the solution phase and the soil's exchange complex is rapid enough to be
considered instantaneous, then the amount adsorbed A can be taken as
dependent only on the concentration c of the soil solution. Assuming that
storage outside the solution phase is due entirely to adsorption (i.e., no
other storage mechanisms, such as precipitation of a component of limited
solubility), then the amount in storage ~s is equal to A. Using these assump-
tions, Eq. (10.23) can be rewritten

A Closed-form Equation for Predicting the Hydraulic Conductivity of Unsaturated So~~~~


                        M. TH. VAN GENUCHTEN2


THE USE OF NUMERICAL MODELS for simulating fluid
flow and mass transport in the unsaturated zone
has become increasingly popular the last few years.
Recent literature indeed demonstrates that much ef-
fort is put into the development of such models (Reeves
and Duguid, 1975; Segol, 1976; Vauclin et al., 1979).
Unfortunately, it appears that the ability to fully
characterize the simulated system has not kept pace
with the numerical and modeling expertise. Prob-
ably the single most important factor limiting the
successful application of unsaturated flow theory to
actual field problems is the lack of information re-
garding the parameters entering the governing transfer
equations. Reliable estimates of the unsaturated hy-
draulic conductivity are especially difficult to ob-
tain, partly because of its extensive variability in the
field, and partly because measuring this parameter is
time-consuming and expensive. Several investigators
have, for these reasons, used models for calculating
the unsaturated conductivity from the more easily
measured soil-water retention curve. Very popular
among these models has been the Millington-Quirk
method (Millington and Quirk, 1961), various forms
of which have been applied with some success in a
number of studies (cf. Jackson et al., 1965; Jackson,
1972; Green and Corey, 1971; Bruce, 1972). Un-
fortunately, this method has the disadvantage of pro-
ducing tabular results which, for example when ap-
plied to nonhomogeneous soils in multidimensional
unsaturated flow models, are quite tedious to use.
Closed-form analytical expressions for predicting


Recently Mualem (1976a) derived a new model for
predicting the hydraulic conductivity from knowledge
of the soil-water retention curve and the conductivity
at saturation. Mualem's derivation leads to a simple
integral formula for the unsaturated hydraulic con-
ductivity which enables one to derive closed-form
analytical expressions, provided suitable equations for
the soil-water retention curves are available. It is the
purpose of this paper to derive such expressions using
an equation for the soil-water retention curve which
is both continuous and has a continuous slope. The
resulting conductivity models generally contain three
independent parameters which may be obtained by
matching the proposed soil-water retention curve to
experimental data. Results obtained with the closed-
form equations based on the Mualem theory will be
compared with observed data for a few soils having
widely varying hydraulic properties.


dump site in the State of Nevada? For years low-level
radioactive waste has been shipped to Beatty. Because of
no enforcement of proper packaging of radioactive waste
by shippers and continual reports of leaking packaging,
efforts to close the Beatty dump site have been going on
for the past few years. After all the powers that be
agreed to close this dump site, we now must wait a couple
more years until Colorado builds its own dump site, and
then we can close ours. Simultaneously research proposals
to study the long-term effects of low-level radioactive
exposure on the health of the population of Nevada have
been submitted the past few years, and all have been
rejected for funding. At present we have no knowledge
what the effects of low-level radiation exposure may have
upon us. I've just mentioned two instances of national
and statewide unconcern for the public's health because
it raises some serious questions regarding a high-level
radioactive dump site in Nevada. And frankly, the term
"repository" is a euphemism I resent. It's a dump site.
   The first question I am posing to you has
to do with the protection of the people of Nevada. Since
the American public is a bit disillusioned with the honesty
of our governmental agencies -- and I won't bother citing
all the examples or even a few of them, I think you're all
familiar with them -- I'm asking you, what outside monitoring

standards were applied to NRC-licensed
facilities, the NRC is proposing to add
substantially equivalent provisions to its
regulations.  Finally, this notice presents
a section-by-section analysis of the
proposed rule (section IV), followed by
the specific text of the proposed
amendments to Part 60.  (The
organization of section IV follows that
of Part 60 while the text of section I is
organized to present a section-by-
section discussion of the EPA standards.
Parts of section IV are therefore
repetitions of information presented in
section I.)

I. Limits on Exposures and Releases

  The limits established by EPA for the
period of repository operations appear
at 40 CFR 191.03.  The limits applicable
to the period after disposal include
"containment requirements" (limits on
cumulative releases of radionuclides to
the environment for 10,000 years) in
~ 191.13, "individual protection
requirements" in ~ 191.15. and "ground
water protection requirements" in
~ 191.16. Implementation of each of
these sections is discussed in the
following paragraphs.
  Standards for repository operations
(~ 191.03). The standards for repositor~
operations are virtually identical to the
standards previously promulgated by
EPA for the uranium fuel cycle (42 FR
2880, January 13, 1977), and will be
implemented in the same manner.1 DOE
will be expected to demonstrate,
through analyses of anticipated facility
performance, that the dose limits of
these standards, as well as the
standards for protection against
radiation set out in 10 CFR Part 20, will
not be exceeded.  Releases of
radionuclides and resulting doses during
operations are amenable to monitoring,
and DOE will be required to conduct a
monitoring program to confirm that the
limits are complied with.  Section
60.111(a) would be amended to includes
the EPA dose limits.  Section 60.101(a)(2)
already includes a provision requiring
"reasonable assurance" that the release
limits be achieved, and it is not
necessary to repeat this language in the


release limits of ~ 60.111.  It is also not
necessary to employ the terms
"management" and "storage," as EPA
has done, since all preclosure repository
operations are already subject to the
provisions of ~ 60.111.
  Postclosure standards.  The EPA
postclosure standards are all expressed
in terms of a "reasonable expectation"
of meeting specified levels of
performance.  EPA explained that it 
selected this term because " `reasonable
assurance has come to be associated
with a level of confidence that may not
be appropriate for the very long-term
analytical projections that are called for
by 191.13." The Commission is sensitive
to the need to account for the
uncertainties involved in predicting
performance over 10,000 years, and the
difficulties as well as the importance of
doing so.  The Commission has
attempted to address this concern in the
existing language of ~ 60.101(a)(2).  That
section requires a finding of reasonable
assurance. "making allowance for the
time period, hazards, and uncertainties
involved, that the outcome will be in
conformance" with the relevant criteria.
Rather than adopt an additional concept
such as "reasonable expectation," the
Commission proposes to add additional
explanatory text, derived from EPA's
wording, to its existing discussion of
reasonable assurance.  This text will
make clear the Commission's belief that
its concept of reasonable assurance,
although somewhat different from
previous usage in reactor licensing, is
appropriate for evaluations of repository
performance where long-term issues and
substantial uncertainties are inherent in
projections of repository performance.
The Commission considers that the level
of confidence associated with its
concept of reasonable assurance is the
same as that sought by EPA in the use of
the term "reasonable expectation."
  In the case of the individual
protection requirements (40 CFR 191.15),
the standards limit the annual dose 
equivalent to any member of the public
in the accessible environment.  A new
provision in ~ 60.112(b) is proposed that
would include the dose limits
established by EPA as well as the
additional specifications, which the
Commission finds to be reasonable, with
regard to consideration of all pathways
including consumption of drinking water
from a "significant source of ground
water," as defined by EPA.
  The EPA standards require that the
individual protection requirements be
achieved only for "undisturbed
performance" of a geologic repository
("disposal system" in EPA's
terminology).  The proposed amendment


The NWPA, while generally conforming
to the earlier NRC regulation, omitted
the provisions dealing with NRC review
of site selection matters.  The
Commission construes this action as an
indication that the site selection issues
previously dealt with in Part 60 were to
be separated from the site
characterization reports and dealt with,
instead, in the environmental
assessments.  Under the NWPA, the
Commission's role in the review of
DOE's site characterization plans is to
determine whether they are appropriate
in light of the Commission's regulations.
Attention will be directed toward the
adequate of the characterization of a
particular site: and this is different from, 
and not dependent upon, the
considerations that led to the selection
of that site.

c. Shaft Sinking


  Some commenters suggested that the
regulation should be amended to require
that DOE may not proceed to 
characterize sites by sinking shafts until
NRC and State review and comment
upon the SCP are complete.  One
commenter suggested that the regulation
be clarified to specify that completion of
NRC review is not a condition precedent
for shaft sinking.  The Commission
agrees with the commenters who regard
NWPA as requiring that DOE defer the
sinking of shafts at least until such time
as there has been an opportunity for
pertinent comments on shaft sinking to
have been solicited and considered by
DOE.  As stated in the preamble to the
proposed rule, "The Commission
believes that Congress intended that
DOE should provide the plans
sufficiently far in advance so that
comments may be developed and
submitted back to DOE early enough to
be considered when shaft sinking
occurs, and all times thereafter."  The
question, therefore, is not whether the
Commission agrees with the objective of
those commenters to defer shaft sinking
until after comments on the SCP have
been received by DOE.  The issue,
rather, was whether the Commission
should include in its own regulations an
interpretation of the obligations of DOE
under the statute.  The Commission has
concluded that it should do so, in the
interests of fulfilling its own
responsibilities more effectively.  The
Commission has stressed the
importance of evaluating alternatives to
major design features that are important
to waste isolation, see 10 CFR
~0.21(c)(1)(ii)(D), and in the case of the
design and location of the shafts this
can only be done prior to their sinking.  It
is important to the Commission that the
comments which it may provide to DOE


with respect to shaft sinking be taken
into account as the Department
proceeds.
  The Commission observes that the
incorporation of this language into the
regulation should have no effect on the
repository program.  If the established
working arrangements (including the
Procedural Agreement, 48 FR 51876,
described in the preamble to the
proposed rule) provide the anticipated
information exchange,  NRC would in
fact be able to review and comment in a
timely fashion during DOE's early
planning processes on those issues that
may have a bearing upon DOE's
decision to proceed with, or delay, the
sinking of repository shafts.  Moreover, 
the Commission is aware that DOE itself
has indicated its intention to wait until it
has completed a review of comments
before proceeding to sink shafts.

d. Simultaneous Promulgation of
Amendments

 
  Some commenters recommended that
all revisions to Part 60 and Part 51 to
conform them to the NWPA should be
promulgated simultaneously.  In
particular, they recommended that the
revisions concerning NEPA
requirements accompany the revisions
currently being promulgated.  They
believe that this would assure that a
comprehensive and integrated approach
is taken and any confusion regarding
NWPA and NEPA requirements would
be eliminated.  They argue that much of
Part 60 now rests on NEPA authority so 
that failure to include NEPA in the
currently proposed revision casts a
cloud over the Commission's view of its
authority to carry out early site reviews.
  The Commission has not put off
considering its obligations under NEPA
as modified by the NWPA.  In
developing these changes to the
regulation, the Commission has
specifically considered whether any
procedures might be needed at the site 
screening or characterization s~age, so
as to assure that the Commissio~ would
be able to meet its ultimate NEPA
responsibilities.  The Commission
concludes that they are not.
  The Commission's Part 51 regulations
govern the Commission's
responsibilities for conducting
environmental reviews associated with
its licensing and regulatory functions.
Section 121(c) of NWPA, 42 U.S.C.
10141, clearly states that the
requirements and criteria set forth in
Part 60 relate to the Commission's
responsibility under the Atomic Energy
Act and the Energy Reorganization Act
and do not require a NEPA EIS.  The Part
51 changes, on the other hand, will

			PRELIMINARY


In conjunction with developing this level of detail, the
phased timing for release of supporting test descriptions and
procedures was discussed and clarified.  Any test descriptions
and procedures which were available at the time the SCP was
issued and which supported the investigation level discussion of
testing contained in SCP could be released for review with the
SCP.  Other test descriptions and procedures would be prepared as
required by test schedules to allow for review by DOE, NRC and
States prior to starting any test. Again, inherent in this agree-
ment is the understanding that detailed test descriptions and
procedures for all testing to be conducted in the exploratory
shaft must be available and reviewed before beginning construc-
tion of the shaft.  Presentation of such phased groupings of test
descriptions and procedures could be included in periodic
progress reports, but need not necessarily be tied to these
progress reports.  Figure 6 was developed to represent the
results of this dicussion.

Further definition of an overall issue resolution strategy was
held pending Tuesday's discussion of performance allocation.  To
initiate this discussion, Felton Bingham presented NNWSI's
approach for implementing performance allocation.  This approach
had previously been presented to DOE HQ staff and endorsed as a
effective method for implementing performance allocation.
NNWSI's presentation raised a number of concerns from the group,
such as concern over the difficulty in changing the performance
goals that might be set initially, and objections to the use of
such terms as "allocation," "goal," and "confidence", which have
standard statistical meanings.  On the subject of revising
initial performance allocations, the group was referred to the
Summary of NRC/DOE Meeting on Subsystem Performance Allocation,
signed and dated on September 27, 1986 (see Attachment C).
Because presentation of NNWSI's approach was more detailed than
that of SRPO or BWIP, detailed interactive discussions and com-
parisons were difficult and there were many questions on assump-
tions and process.  However, BWIP and SRPO both saw merit in the
NNWSI approach.  They believed that it was complimentary and
consistent with their evolving approaches.  They indicated that
they wished to review the approach critically and discuss with
NNWSI both details of the approach and the success that NNWSI was
having in implementing it.  Project representatives agreed in
concept with HQ that the site-specific performance allocation
strategies should be as consistent as possible.  They agreed to
work toward extensive commonality, but emphasized that it was
important not to over-constrain the performance allocation
approaches at this early stage of their development, as the
approaches were new and would be changing as they were refined.



~  For performance assessment uses, refer to specific performance
   assessment analyses (described in Section 8.3.5 of the SCP) which
   will use the information produced from the studies described
   above, and refer to any use of the results for model validation;

~  For design uses, refer to, or describe, where the information
   from the study described above will be used in construction
   equipment design and development and engineering system design
   and development (e.g., waste package, repository engineered
   barriers, and shafts and borehole seals); and

~  For characterization uses, refer to, or describe, where the
   information from the study described above will be used in
   planning other characterization activities.


V. Schedule and Milestones:

~  Provide the durations of and interrelationships among the
   principal activities associated with conducting the study (e.g.,
   preparation of test procedures, test set-ups, testing, data
   analyses, preparation of reports), and indicate the key
   milestones including decision points associated with the study
   activities;

~  Describe the timing of this study relative to other studies and
   other program activities that will affect, or will be affected
   by, the schedule for completion of the subject study; and

~  Dates for activities or milestones, including durations and
   interrelationships, for the study plans will be provided.  These
   should reference the master schedules provided in Section 8.5. of
   the SCP.

	Figure 8.3.5.16-1 shows the phases of the DOE's performance confirmation
program relative to the stages of the overall repository program.  The DOE's
performance confirmation program, as discussed earlier, is divided into base-
line and confirmation phases, with the submittal of the license application
serving as a convenient demarcation between phases.  Before the license
application, site characterization testing provides for baseline data on site
conditions important to repository design and performance, monitoring of
changes in those conditions as a result of site characterization, predictions
of changes in those conditions as a result of construction and operation, and
predictions of repository performance after closure.

	With the submittal of the license application, the DOE begins the formal
licensing process with the NRC.  The license application will present the
performance assessments intended to show that repository performance will
satisfy the regulatory postclosure performance objectives and will also
present the data on site conditions upon which the repository design and
performance assessments are based.  Further data gathering activities after
the application is submitted are intended to be confirmatory or for other
purposes, such as design optimization.

	A subset of the testing conducted during site characterization to
support the resolution of the performance and design issues in the license
application will provide the baseline data needed to meet the requirements of
10 CFR 60.140(d) (2), (3).  This includes baseline data on the parameters
important to design and performance, as well as data on natural processes
that may be changed by site characterization, construction, and operational
activities.  All the activities presently required to obtain this baseline
information are included in the site characterization program, and the
information needed is identified in two performance allocation tables.  If,
based on data and other information gathered during site characterization,
the need for additional baseline information is identified, the baseline
phase of the performance confirmation program will be appropriately expanded
or otherwise modified.

	Some of the site charact~rization activities that also meet requirements
of 10 CFR 60.140(d) (2) and (3) for performance confirmation during the base-
line phase will be continued past the license application submittal date, if
continuation of these activities would produce useful data of a confirmatory
nature.  Such activities fall into two general categories: (1) long-term
monitoring of natural processes, events, or site conditions (e.g., seismic
monitoring and monitoring of unsaturated zone hydrologic parameters) and
(2) long-duration in situ testing to characterize processes and evaluate
conceptual models (e.g., in situ testing of flow processes in the unsaturated
zone).  These activities are also consistent with and would support the
requirements of 10 CFR 60.141 for confirmation of geotechnical and design
parameters during construction and operation.  Data collected from such
activities during characterization would be used in licensing assessments.

	Tables 8.3.5.16-1 and -2 list the testing and monitoring activities in
each of the above categories that have been te~~~~tively identified.  Included
in the tables are the test titles, locations, purposes, value for performance
or design confirmation, approximate dates, and the SCP section that provides
