was out of line in using his position to advance
his personal beliefs. Additionally, they are con-
cerned that this may prove a pivotal moment in
the relationship between sportsmen and fish and
game departments-~it appears that Gibbons
would like to see government bureaucrats make
some of the ethical decisions that have tradition-
ally been left up to individual hunters.
  Even though many hunters choose not to pur-
sue bear with the aid of hounds, they support the
rights of those who do. Others feel like Gibbons,
that the practice is not sporting, so they don't do
it. Hunting is an activity dominated by ethical
considerations, including the decision to hunt in
the first place. And much of the individual satis-
faction of the sport comes from the knowledge
that a hunt was conducted in a safe, ethical man-
ner and in conjunction with sound wildlife
management principles. Gibbons's recom-
mendations would remove this part of the hunt-
ing experience. Some might think this is a good
idea. Others, clearly, do not.
  For now, the issue remains unresolved. Let-
ters and phone calls have poured into California
Governor Pete Wilson's office calling for
Gibbons's resignation. The commission will hear
additional public testimony on the issue at its
August 6 meeting and should vote on the matter
then.-~E.K.

officials have stated that "active man-
agement" as well as regulated hunting
are vital elements of the conservation
plan for the Eastern Mojave Desert.
  Environmental and animal rights ex-
tremists want to set a precedent by clos-
ing off this expanse of land to many ac-
tivities. The LaRocco amendment sends 
the message that the American people 
want their public land managed for a
wide variety of uses to benefit all the
people, not just a narrow group of ex-
tremists. Allowing hunting on 20% of the
Desert Protection Act land-~where it has
been allowed for generations-~is a fair
and reasonable position.
  ILA encourages all NRA members to 
contact their Senators and Representa-
tive and urge them to support the LaR-
occo Amendment. Without this vital
change, please urge your lawmakers to
vote against the California Desert Pro-
tection Act.
  Rep. LaRocco deserves the thanks
and support of hunters and NRA mem-
bers nationwide for standing up to the
environmental and animal rights extrem-
ists and for his commitment to our hunt-
ing heritage.
  This effort to protect hunting in the
California desert and strong support for 
the Hunter Protection Act (S.187 and
H.R.1815) sponsored by the Congres-
sional Sportsmen's Caucus are vital ele-
ments of the ILA federal legislative strat-

NRA's Hat Is Off To
Madison Ban Beaters

RECENTLY, the Madison-area Citizens
Against Crime, a group of con-
cerned residents of that Wisconsin city,
narrowly defeated a handgun ban refer-
endum that early polls had shown pass-
ing by a landslide.
  Victory against these formidable
odds would not have been possible but
for the hard work of dedicated gun own-


ers and citizens concerned about their
civil rights. Three companies played par-
ticularly significant roles, both financially
and with volunteers, in helping to defeat
the gun ban referendum.
  Gander Mountain, one of the nation's
leading merchandisers of hunting, fish-
ing and camping equipment, led the
way. The company distributes over 30
million catalogs per year and has five re-
tail locations in Wisconsin.
  Dave Reirden, Gander Mountain
president, and Kevin McKown, a man-
ager of Gander's Madison store, coordi-
nated the firm's support efforts. Gander
Mountain wrote to 25,000 catalog
customers in Madison asking them to
oppose the ban, donated valuable news-
paper space, and completed over
16,000 "get out the vote" phone calls on
voting day. The phone calls were made
by more than 100 store and corporate
employees who volunteered their time.
  Terry Kohler, an NRA Life Member, is
chairman of the board of North Sails
Group, Inc., a firm famous worldwide as
a producer of sails for racing and cruis-
ing sailboats. His financial backing 
played a major role in defeating the anti-
gunners. Political activism is in Terry
Kohler's veins-~his father and grandfa-
ther were governors of Wisconsin.
  John Lunenschloss, president of Air-
Lec Industries, gave his company's
strong financial support to the effort. Air-
Lec Industries was founded in Madison 
in 1921, and provides automatic swing-
ing doors for the food preparation and
cold storage industry. Lunenschloss-~
"Moose" as friends call him-~is an NRA
Benefactor Member, and all his grand-
children are Life Members.
  NRA members are urged to support
those industries and companies that
support the rights of gun owners. If you

companies that helped carry the day in 
Madison, you can contact them at: Gan-

Former NRA Staffer
Col. 'Tod' Sloan Dies

COL. E.F. "Tod" Sloan, USA (Ret.), of
Redwood City, California, who
served the NRA in various capacities for
more than 35 years, died May 29. He
was 92. His wife Gwendolin survives.


A native of Chehalis, Washington,
and a graduate of the University of Ore-
gon, Col. Sloan joined the National
Guard in 1918 and after graduation from
college entered the Army in 1923. While
in the service, he was an active rifle and
pistol competitive shooter, a Distin-
guished Rifleman and the National High-
power Rifle champion in 1931.
  Col. Sloan began a second career
with NRA as a summer employee in
1938, became a field representative in
1940, and then departed for U.S. Army
Air Force service in World War II in 1942,
ultimately attaining the grade of colonel.
  Returning from World War II service,
Col. Sloan served on the NRA Board of
Directors and was Director of Civilian
Marksmanship for two years. Col. Sloan
was delegated by the NRA in 1947 to
help manage and revitalize the National
Skeet Shooting Ass'n during a difficult
period for that organization.
  Returning to NRA service as the
Western States field representative in
1952, Col. Sloan was involved in innu-
merable shooting training programs and
as NRA's representative to kindred orga-
nizations before his retirement in 1977.

founded, and more than fulfills that
pledge of "continued excellence."
  Though it would be tedious and
impractical to list every new program
and every one of our accomplishments
since 1981, it is imperative that a few
be mentioned:
  ~ The American Legion Family
Support Network, a network of Legion
volunteers connected by sophisticated
communications technology, was cre-
ated during Desert Storm and, so far,
has helped more than 30,000 families
of active duty service people during
times of crisis;
  ~ The National Emergency Fund
raised nearly $1 million and donated
more than $330,000 to help Legion-
naire victims of natural disaster, such
as Hurricane Hugo;
  ~ The Temporary Financial Assis-
tance program is currently making
grants totaling more than $300,000 a
year to the children of needy veterans
who need food, clothing, shelter and
medical care;


  ~ The Child Welfare Foundation, to
which you donated more than $1 mil-
lion, awarded $243,000 in 1992 to 10
nonprofit organizations dedicated to
promoting the wholesome develop-
ment of America's youth;
  ~ American Legion Baseball fields
718 more teams today than it did a
decade ago, giving 15,000 more
youngsters an opportunity to learn
about sportsmanship and team work.
  While some of these programs
were financed largely by contributions
you earmarked for that purpose, many
of the direct and indirect costs of
administering them were paid for with
dues dollars.
  The list could continue with details
about the Junior Shooting Sports Pro-
gram, our support for national memo-
rials, job fairs for active duty person-
nel, college loan programs, and
scholarships for numerous athletic and
academic endeavors. But much of the 
Legion's work takes place on Capitol
Hill, where veterans find a strong
voice in support of their interests.
  For instance, during the past dec-
ade, the Legion:
  ~ Was the only veterans' organiza-
tion to present a comprehensive plan
to preserve the VA medical system
and integrate it into any approved sys-


tem of national health care. This plan
("An American Legion Proposal To
Improve Veterans Health Care" -~
see June 1993 issue of THE AMERI-
CAN LEGION magazine) was presented
to Mrs. Clinton's Health Care Task
Force in April.
  ~ Supported the passage of the
Montgomery GI Bill, subsequent
increases in benefits, and is now
actively lobbying for the adoption of a
Persian Gulf GI Bill;
  ~ Played a key role in documenting
the need for medical assistance for
those suffering from illnesses unique
to the Gulf War;
  ~ Conducted the Columbia Univer-
sity\American Legion study of Viet-
nam veterans which paved the way for
allowing many service-connected ben-
efits related to Agent Orange exposure
and PTSD;
  ~ Has been vocal and insistent in its
support for transition benefits for
active and reserve components sepa-
rated due to military downsizing;
  ~ Stood firmly in its opposition to
allowing openly homosexual men and
women to serve in the Armed Forces;
  ~ Continues to lobby for the pas-
sage of a constitutional amendment to
protect the U.S. Flag from desecration,
and has played a key role in the enact-
ment of 33 state resolutions calling for
congressional action;
  ~ Provided strong and vocal support
for the resolution of the POW/MIA
issue, and staunch opposition to the
normalization of relations with Viet-
nam until every POW is accounted for
and repatriated;
  ~ Supported the Contras and the
development of democracy in the 
Caribbean Basin;
  ~ Developed documentation about
the aging veteran health-care crisis
and provided strong legislative sup-
port on their behalf;
  ~ Helped create the Job Training
Partnership Act and the Disabled Vet-
erans Outreach Program;
  ~ Helped create Vet Centers and
acquire VA treatment for PTSD and
certain ailments associated with expo-
sure to Agent Orange;
  ~ Was instrumental in creating the
Veterans Readjustment Appointment
Authority and the U.S Court of Veter-
ans Appeals;
  ~ Lead the way for the creation of
the Department of Veterans Affairs;
  ~ Helped create the position of 
Assistant Secretary of Veterans Em-
ployment and Training in the Depart-
ment of Labor;
  ~ Established a job training and
placement program for veterans in

domestic junk are good comple-
ments precisely because they're
usually out of sync. When the
U.S. economy is weak, foreign
bonds produce strong returns
because the dollar and rates are

is strong during expansions
while foreign bonds lag because
of a rising greenback and climb-

Vegetables that grow best during the long, cool fall season should
be started now. Chinese cabbage, brussels sprouts, cabbage, and
cauliflower all can be sown in late June or early July. You can sow
the seeds where the plants are to remain in the garden, or start
them in an out-of-the-way garden corner and transplant them later,
after they've developed their second true set of leaves. Thin or
transplant the young seedlings so they stand 12 to 15 inches apart,
and mulch to maintain soil moisture and eliminate weeds. If cab-
bage butterflies are a problem in your area, it's a good idea to
keep your crops covered with a spun polyester row cover. Green
Acre cabbage, above, is one of many cabbage varieties you can
choose from.

Wine of the Month
Count Matuschka-Greiffenclau is an
articulate German vintner who runs
Schloss Vollrads, a historic winery on
the Rhine in the Rheingau.  This
ancient estate has produced wine for
nearly eight hundred years.  In recent
vintages Matuschka has focused on
making well-balanced dry wines that 
retain their fruit.  An excellent example
is the 1990 Schloss Vollrads, Rhein-
gau Riesling, Sp~~~tlese, Rosasilber

wine that has wonderful orange and
peach flavors.  It's $25 a bottle.

Spirit of the Month
Stubbs is a white rum that differs in a
few ways from its Caribbean cousins.
For one thing, it's made in Queens-
land, Australia.  For another, it's dis-

sugarcane, not from dark molasses.
The result is an exceptionally dry and
elegant spirit that not only mixes 
nicely with tonic but also is delicious

ent shop into a jack-of-all-trades for the
multimedia age. From the sleek, $16 mil-
lion headquarters that I. M. Pei designed
for him in Beverly Hills, Ovitz offers
his clients advice on everything from
advertising and investment banking to
sports marketing and technology. CAA's
100-odd agents run the gamut from Ar-
mani-wearing types to gray-suited num-
ber-crunchers (page 54).
FIRM HAND. Make no mistake: Ovitz still
derives his clout from the big names in
his Filofax. Michael Jackson, Steven
Spielberg, Kevin Costner, and so on.
Just look at this summer's big movies:


CAA packaged combinations of stars, di-
rectors, and writers for Jurassic Park
and Cliffhanger. It represented many of
the stars in Dave, Sleepless in Seattle,
and Dennis the Menace. And Ovitz res-
cued The Firm, a project that had all
but fallen apart last year when CAA
client Tom Cruise balked at the directors
Paramount had proposed for the film.
Along came Ovitz, with client Sydney
Pollack in tow. With Pollack at the helm,
The Firm has generated $115 million in
ticket sales so far.
  What sets Ovitz apart, though, is his
dogged push to insinuate himself and
CAA into realms far beyond mere movie-
making. The MGM deal solidifies his sta-
tus as Hollywood's foremost investment
banker. He already advised Sony on its
$3.4 billion purchase of Columbia Pic-
tures and brokered Matsushita's nearly
$7 billion acquisition of MCA.
  Ovitz can be a powerful force behind
the scenes, too. This spring, he offered


shopping tips to Edgar Bronfman Jr., a
longtime friend and president of Joseph
E. Seagram Corp., who was looking to
invest in a media company. In June,
Bronfman plunked down more than $700
million for a 5.7% stake in Time Warner
Inc. Ovitz is also advising Paramount
Communications Corp. on possible deals,
including a joint venture with British
recording giant Thorn EMI PLC that
didn't get off the ground: "He's an op-
portunist," says Paramount Chairman
Martin S. Davis, "and I mean that in
the finest sense of the word."
  Last year, Ovitz spirited the creative


portion of Coca-Cola Co.'s huge advertis-
ing account away from McCann-Erick-
son Worldwide, the soft-drink giant's
longtime agency. Now, he is trying to
help Nike Inc. break into sports-event
promotion by producing a Super Bowl
for college football, with six playoff
games, TV specials, and a worldwide sat-
ellite broadcast. As with everything,
Ovitz views the deal in multimedia
terms: "Entertainment and sports will
be the Trojan horse that brings every-
thing else into the home," he says.
  To close the loop on digital media,
Ovitz is also forging ties with technology
companies that produce multimedia hard-
ware and software. In recent months,
Ovitz has cultivated such high-tech
heavyweights as Microsoft Chairman
William H. Gates III, Apple Computer
Chairman John Sculley, and Robert M.
Kavner, technology czar at AT&T.
  Ovitz and Gates are nearing an agree-
ment to co-develop interactive TV com-

that Ovitz is tending more to Gates or
Sculley than Cruise could prove damag-
ing. As Paramount President Stanley R.
Jaffe, a longtime Ovitz champion, points
out: "In a creative business, when some-
one doesn't get a call back in the 30
minutes he's allotted you, he may start
to look elsewhere." Indeed, ICM's Berg
crows that five CAA clients, including
actor James Woods, have left Ovitz'
agency in recent weeks.
  Woods may be no Madonna or Spiel-
berg. But Ovitz can't shrug off any client
defections, since he owns little but his
relationships. What's more, industry ex-
perts say overall revenue in the talent-
agent business has dropped 20% since
1991 as Hollywood battles its costs. For
his part, Ovitz insists CAA's revenues
are up. Rivals estimate the agency rakes
in $200 million a year; Ovitz' 55% stake
could net him an estimated $10 million.
Still, CAA draws its power from an
ephemeral network of clients and po-

had the Gospel Festival, with a spe-
cial tribute to Thomas Dorsey, "the
father of gospel music" and a
Chicagoan.
  But our biggest festival is Taste of
Chicago. Every year pitchmen come
in with new ideas such as, "You can't
do Taste of Chicago without bungee
jumping," or, "You can't do Taste with-
out balloon rides." But we stick with
the basics: food, beverages and enter-
tainment. And our follow-up surveys
let us know that the people have been
satisfied. There isn't a whole lot we do
differently from year to year.
  The basic format of the festivals
has always worked for us, so we're
careful not to mess with it. But we
do continue to improve each year.
For the first time this year, when
Taste opens on June 25 and goes on
for 10 days, people can use their
credit cards to purchase food. We're
also going to have double-decker
shuttle buses to provide free trans-
portation for the lunch crowd in the

Letters  TO THE EDITOR

Paper dragons

  Your article "Going With the Flow" [May 2], par-
ticularly interested me since I work with a docu-
ment image management software company that
develops software products that address some of
the very problems presented in the article.
  Originally, computers were supposed to slay the
paper dragons that surround us in business. How-
ever, they did just the opposite, since they made it
easier to create, edit, and print documents. Now,


they had acquired. After nine
months, when Father knew that the
farm project was a failure, the most
painful part for David was selling
the calf.
  When the letter arrived telling
Mother that Pa was giving up and 
coming back to Chicago, she cried,
softly and helplessly, for three days.
She, too, loved farming and had
shared my father's dreams. Now
what would become of them?
  The dreamer came back to look for
a job. He was stern with himself. "A
man must suffer," he said.
  Dave, who had been a poor stu-
dent before, now dropped out of
school and at the age of 14 persuad-
ed a recruitment officer that he was
16 and enlisted in the Army. He
served as a bugler in World War I
and, after being mustered out, grav-
itated to Texas, where he worked on
a cattle ranch.
  I was born during that war, but it
was years later that Dave again re-
turned home and I met my "true"
brother, whose heroic existence I had
shared in my dreams. I regarded
him as my "true" brother because of
my identification with his exciting
life and because my other brother,
Harry, was so much older, lived
apart from us with his own family
(including a son whom I detested),
and he simply did not seem like a
brother. How wonderful it must be, I
thought, to have a brother to play
with. All I had were sisters, and they
were no fun at all.
  My sisters assured me that Dave
had been a boy of infectious charm
and outstanding good looks, with jet
black hair and great black eyes.
What none of us knew, of course, was
that Dave had turned mean.


where my mother and father slept. I
slept on a day bed that was unfolded
nightly in the dining room.
  The great room, however, was the
parlor, which was never occupied ex-
cept by the most important visitors or
used except for state occasions, such
as the death of an aunt. It could be
looked at, but woe to me if my moth-
er caught me stepping across the in-
visible barrier that separated it from
our normal living quarters. The sight
alone, however, was an aesthetic ex-
perience of some magnitude. The fur-
niture was all bought at the store on
12th Street called Hartman's. On the
day it was acquired, we all went to
this great store, and my mother and
my sisters chose each piece after
much study and deliberation.
  I can still see this special furniture
being uncrated in our flat, with my
mother anxiously in attendance to
make certain each object was in per-
fect condition, her "jewels" from the
shana (beautiful) store.
  The rug that covered the floor was
russet with a gold border, floating
softly on the shining surface of var-
nished hardwood. A large bay win-
dow faced directly over Douglas
Park, about whose trees that radiant
light we see only in childhood slant-
ed through the Venetian blinds (they
were the latest thing) and patterned
the pale, white walls with bright hor-
izontal shafts and glowed on the 
dark, polished furnishings, the ma-
hogany sofa with its velvet uphol-
stery and the outrageously coiffured
curls that bedecked the legs of the
center table.
  Our flat was on the third floor of a
building that housed virtually every
living member of my family-~uncles
and aunts, cousins and near cousins.

Flight safety


(Continued from page 79) kowski of the 
Association of Flight Attendants, which
represents cabin-crew workers at twenty-
one U.S. airlines. Small mock-ups, he says,
lack realism.
  Flight attendants, pilots, and the Safety
Board say that attendants are often con-
fused because they work on several differ-
ent types of aircraft. Emergency proce-
dures and the location of equipment can
vary on each. There can even be variations
on the same type. And the manuals that
trainees study can be thick, dense, and dif-
ficult to follow. Pollard sees no reason for
confusion. "I can get on an aircraft and
find the equipment," she says. "How many
places are there to put it?"


  IN BRITAIN, FLIGHT ATTENDANTS
  are allowed to fly on only three types of
  aircraft. The FAA has no such rule in the 
United States. Delta Airlines trains its
flight attendants on all eight aircraft types
now in its fleet; other major U.S. airlines
train their cabin crew on five or more.
  "It's very difficult for flight attendants
to be proficient on more than three types
of aircraft, because you could confuse
yourself in an emergency," says Gordon
Bennett, chairman of Cabin Crew 89, a
union representing British Airways flight
attendants. "When you have only seconds
to act and you're worrying about how to
open an exit door, the fewer aircraft you're
licensed on, the better. It's crazy to be cer-
tified on more than three types."
  Unlike their American counterparts,
British flight attendants must meet before
every flight to discuss safety issues. The se-
nior attendant on each British flight must
brief other attendants and test knowledge
of emergency procedures before takeoff.
  In Germany and Sweden, flight atten-
dants must be certified by the federal gov-
ernment. "You need a license to cut hair in
Alabama, but no license is required to be a
flight attendant in this country," says a
U.S. pilot.
  Mike Gordon, of Cabin Crew 89, says
airlines need to improve coordination be-
tween pilots and flight attendants. "That's
vital," Gordon says. "There's a need to
have attendants training with pilots. I'd
like to see them together for at least half a
day during initial training and a few hours 
during recurrent."
  The Safety Board agrees in principle. In
one of the thirteen recommendations put
to the FAA, the board also called for train-
ing designed to improve coordination and
communication between cabin and cock-
pit crews. "Some airlines do joint
pilot-flight attendant training, but we


want all airlines to do it, and do more of
it," says Nora Marshall, a senior accident
investigator at the Safety Board. "We
want group exercises during evacuation
and ditching [over water] training."
  The FAA says it has advised airlines
about the importance of such coordina-
tion, but it will not put out a regulation or
force airlines to conduct group evacua-
tion and ditching drills during recurrent
training. "We're giving this issue a lot of
priority, but we'd like to see changes
through other means than regulations,"
says Pollard. New regulations, she adds,
can be costly to the airlines, the govern-
ment, and the traveling public, and the
FAA is required by federal law to consid-
er cost factors before implementing a new
safety rule.
  The FAA also disagrees with several
other Safety Board recommendations. The
agency sees no need for individual instruc-
tors who would evaluate flight attendants
during hands-on exit drills to make sure
that they performed successfully. It also
opposes a recommendation calling for new
guidelines for FAA inspectors on how to
evaluate training programs "to ensure that
flight attendants retain the skills and
knowledge that are necessary in emergency
situations." The FAA says it believes that
the current system of annual recurrent
training is sufficient.
  Nonetheless, it yielded to complaints
sufficiently to form an advisory committee
of airline and union officials-~a committee
that often finds it difficult to reach con-
sensus. It has recently been trying to deter-
mine what training should be made obli-
gatory. Mary Ellen Miller of the
Independent Federation of Flight Atten-
dants says she is frustrated by the lack of
progress. "We've been meeting for a cou-
ple of years and, yes, it could virtually go
on forever. You can committee something
to death if that's your intention. If I were a
pessimist, I'd say that is the intent here."
  Conflict arises over anxiety that crew
performance during emergencies could
also be depreciated by lengthy workdays
(which can exceed sixteen hours on some
international flights). After years of urg-
ing, the federal agency recently proposed
rules that prohibit airlines from scheduling
flight attendants for more than fourteen
hours of duty on domestic and interna-
tional flights. Attendants don't think this
is good enough, because the proposed lim-
its apply only to scheduled hours, whereas
time on the job can be extended by flight
delays.
  There is further conflict over emergency
medical training. "Far more attention is

focused on in-flight meals and passenger
service," says Constance Stevens, a safety
expert who flies for a U.S. airline and
treats about one medical emergency each
year. "We have very minimal first aid
training, and it's not sufficient. So many
children are traveling today, but we are not
familiar with the different ways of treating
infants, children, and the elderly."
  "There's no evidence that flight atten-
dants don't have enough emergency med-
ical training," says the FAA's Pollard.
  
  THE SITE WHERE TRUDY SMITH'S
  life was changed forever is now a piece
  of Everglades marshland supervised
by the South Florida Water Management
District. Two months ago she finally re-
turned here-~another step in exorcising
the long memory of her ordeal. "You go
through a year of thinking you're nuts be-
fore you realize that you may be normal,"
says Smith. "It took two years to find a
good psychologist, three years to be able to
fly again."
  The nightmares are over now for Smith,
who has marshaled strong positive
thoughts and is happy with the personality
change that overtook her after the crash.
"I came out of the Everglades completely
changed," she says. "I was a naive, shy per-
son who would do anything I was told. I
came out of the crash a fighter-~I knew I
was going to have to fight for my sanity
and for everything that was mine.
  "When you don't save everyone's life,
you start questioning all that you did,"
adds Smith, who found out only three
months after the crash that the coach pas-
senger she prevented from going to the
bathroom lived through the ordeal. "It's a
matter of putting an end to it and getting
on with your life."
  The return to the Everglades was special
also because it was the first time Smith met
with Jan Murray after counseling her by
phone-~one of many survivors she has
counseled in this way or with postcrash-
trauma videotapes. Although the two
worked for different airlines, they, ironi-
cally, were in the same classroom in
1978-~eleven years before Murray was in
the Sioux City crash. Smith was a guest
lecturer when the rookie Murray went
through the initial training before her first
flight. "I was just a small-town girl from
South Carolina who wanted to see the
world," says Murray. "When Trudy spoke
at the training seminar, I realized that she
had been there, had traveled down every
road, and she became my hero. The true
meaning of the job, safety above all,
dawned on me for the first time."        ~

take for an average adult is 2400 milligrams
per day or less.

5 Potassium. Per serving. It's question-
able whether potassium is needed in a
sports drink.

6 Cost per container. Except as noted, all

make glasses while you wait; instead,
they send the order to an outside lab-
oratory as private practitioners do.
But the price might be worth the
wait-~warehouse stores cut their
profit to the bone. (Warehouse stores
often carry designer labels, too; a
recent visitor to Price Club saw
brands including Liz Claiborne, Polo
by Ralph Lauren, and Evan Picone
alongside cheaper, generic frames.)
  Recently, LensCrafters and Pearle
have also started going after the
many folks who want to pay mass-
merchandiser prices. LensCrafters is
opening dozens of optical stores in
K Marts under the name Sight &
Save this year. There it will sell com-
plete glasses at $39 to $99. And
Pearle has installed an "Eye Buys"
section in some of its stores: Com-
plete glasses sell for $80, cheaper
than many frames alone cost else-
where in the same store.

Glasses to go

  Optical superstores with an on-
premises lab can make most glasses
in much less than a day (although
some lens coatings and prescrip-
tions, especially for bifocals, can take
longer). In our survey, readers re-
ported that the fastest chains were
EyeMasters, LensCrafters, and Opti-
World, all of which managed to fill
more than half of their orders in less
than a day. LensCrafters ads promise
to produce glasses within an hour,
and 56 percent of the chain's cus-
tomers in our survey said they re-
ceived their glasses that quickly. In
all, 83 percent said their glasses were
ready by the day's end.
  The longest waits were at Price
Club, Frame-n-Lens, For Eyes, Sears,
and Royal Optical, where most cus-
tomers waited at least a week for
their glasses. About one-quarter of
the readers who went to Royal com-
plained that the glasses weren't
ready when promised. The same
number complained that EyeMasters
stores were too slow: Although Eye-
Masters was faster than most other
chains, it was not as fast as readers
said they had been led to expect.
  In principle, even stores without an
on-premises lab may be able to get
you glasses in a day or so on special
request. For Eyes and Sears, for ex-
ample, electronically transmit orders
to a central lab. If you visit the store
early enough in the day, overnight
air delivery can return the finished
spectacles the next day or the day
after that. Both chains told us they
don't charge for the service. Frame-

it, and it's unlikely it would have worked,
anyway. When we called a special investor
hotline set up by the National Association of
Securities Dealers (NASD) to disclose the
backgrounds of brokers, we were told (both
over the phone and in writing) that "nothing
was pending" concerning broker "Jones."
The SEC case was not mentioned by the
NASD, as it should have been.
  This story, however, is neither about one
bad adviser nor any one company. Although
the risk of receiving bad advice always
exists, advisers by and large are honest and
follow a long list of rules set by the industry.
And even the most conscientiously designed
plan can go wrong. This tale concerns the
lack of government oversight of one of the
largest industries in America.
  Finding a competent planner who has
your interests in mind is hard enough by
itself. We sent staff members, male and
female, from the CD offices to every differ-
ent type of "planner"-~stockbrokers, inde-
pendent advisers, affiliated planners, insur-
ance agents, accountants, bank counselors
and lawyers-~to find out what a person off
the street would be offered in the way of
responsible advice. Too many simply tried
to sell us high-commission products with lit-
tle or no regard for the suitability of the
"plan" to our stated objectives; often, no


product line-~as is the case with many bro-
kerages, insurance agencies and banks-~the
narrower the advice was and the quicker and
harder the sales pitch. But such behavior
wasn't inevitable; we found competence and
a conscientious approach displayed by at
least one planner in each category. The help
is out there, even if it's hard to find.
  In fact, the issue isn't corrupt or self-
interested planners, even though on an indi-
vidual basis, such people can cause terrible
harm. The problem is that consumers aren't
getting the protection they should from the
governmental agencies and private organi-
zations that claim to provide it. If the agen-
cies charged with monitoring financial
advice won't protect you, who will?

Why The System Is Troubled. Finding honest,
objective financial advice has to be one of
the toughest tasks facing today's consumers.
After three years of research, we discovered
an industry in which anyone can hang out a
shingle to handle your life savings and not
be effectively policed by any government
agency. Too many of these advisers will
earn healthy commissions on what they sell,
no matter how it benefits-~or hurts-~you.
  Basically, financial advisers can operate
anywhere there's a desk and a phone. Only
26 states require that investment-adviser
firms-~not individuals-~even register with
state securities departments. That process
usually involves filling out a form. Of
course, those who sell insurance, securities
and real estate (or are accountants or
lawyers) must have licenses and pass tests.


  ~ What are your credentials and educational
background? How long have you been doing
financial planning? Are you a full-time planner,

able-~financial condition and goals, make your
way to the door.)

transplanted hair appears more natural.
From 30 to 350 plugs are transplanted at
each two- to three-hour session. One to four
sessions are usually required, scheduled a
month or more apart. Transplanted hair falls
out in a few weeks and comes in fresh in
about three more months, growing at the
same rate as it did before it was moved-~
about half an inch a month. The entire treat-
ment takes from eight to 18 months, which
is one reason it is so pricey (see table).
  Transplanted hair is not forever. At best,
it lasts as long as it would have at the origi-
nal site. Any follicles that are inadvertently
compressed during the process may produce
curly hair, where it was previously straight.
The best candidates for transplantation are:
  ~ Men with receding hairlines and/or
bald spots at the top of the head. Men with
large areas of baldness may not have enough
donor hair to fill in these areas.
  ~ White men with gray, blond, red and
light-brown hair. More dark hair is required
because of the contrast with light skin.
  ~ Men with curly hair, because it covers
so well and stays in the area in which it is
planted. Wavy hair does not give quite as
good results. Straight hair covers least well.
  ~ Men with fine hair. While it doesn't
cover as well as thick hair, fine hair usually
gives a better result because it is more man-
ageable than thick hair strands.
  ~ Men with dense hair. Although when
transplanted, it could look tufted and not
natural, smaller-sized grafts may prevent
this problem.
  The other surgical technique for trans-
planting hair is the "flap." This is usually
performed by a plastic surgeon while the
patient is in an operating room under gener-
al anesthesia. The surgeon cuts a wide strip
of hair-bearing scalp and, leaving a small
"foot" attached to maintain its blood and
nerve supply, rotates it to a denuded area
where a like-size strip of bald scalp has been
removed. After fitting it, the surgeon sutures
the flap to hold it in place. The edges of the
wound left behind are also sutured shut.
Once the flap has established its own blood
supply, the small "foot" is cut away.

Reducing the Bald Spot. Instead of moving
hair into the bald area, the bald area itself
can be reduced. Sometimes called a "hair-
lift," this is done by a plastic surgeon in an
operating room while the patient is under
general anesthesia. An ellipse-shaped piece
of bare scalp about two inches wide and
seven inches long is cut out, and the gaping
edges are brought together and sutured.
After the scalp heals, only a thin line is left.
A series of scalp reductions can be carried
out over a course of many months to keep
reducing the bald area.

cense to have a life of entitlement.
     We took trips to Bali and Carnival
in Rio.  Sometimes I was embarrassed
because Connie, of course, always
paid.  She'd say, "Don't be ridiculous.  
I want to go, and I want you to be
with me."  She handled it all very
matter-of-factly, made me feel great
that she cared so much for me, said I
was worth it.  She called me Beauty.
That just about brought me to my 
knees.
     The decisions were all in her court, 
and I was at her disposal in terms of
time, interests, sex.  This was never
spoken but was always in the air be-
tween us:  "It's my money, so we'll do
it my way."  I gave her all power in
the relationship, couldn't even dis-
agree with her.  If she'd had no 
money, I probably wouldn't have put
up with it.
     When I was offered work as a mu-
sician, she made the decision for me,
saying, "You don't have to take the
job!"  She loved that I was a pianist
but didn't want my music to interfere
with our life together.  I couldn't tell
her, but this was eating away at my
confidence.  After about two years,
the strain started to show, although
we were still very pleasant to each
other.
     Then she told me her ex-husband
had become quite ill, and if he died,
half of his art collection would have
to be sold to cover the taxes on the
other half.  He had also asked her to 
remarry him, but she said she
wouldn't if it would upset me.  In re-
ality, I knew she would anyway.
     Our affair had to end sometime,
and here was a graceful way out, so I
urged her to go ahead with the re-
marriage.  I even escorted her to the
jewelry store to buy a new diamond
and ruby wedding ring.
     I felt pretty low when she left.  All
along, I knew exactly what I wanted
from her...but not how attached to
the opulence I'd actually become.
Now I only want more.


The Stud

     Jean-Claude grew up in Rouen,
France, where his widowed mother
worked in a tailor's shop, read fashion
magazines, and fantasized about lead-
ing an affluent life.  By his teens, he
realized that he, too, yearned for
glamour.  So, with a knockoff Versace
suit, a few changes of underwear, and
the equivalent of $150, Jean-Claude
left for Paris at nineteen to begin his
social ascent.

     I'd heard that to meet a rich


woman I should go to the Ang~~lique,
a quiet, refined tea shop behind the
Louvre.  The patrons were elegant
women, some alone, some in pairs.
My first time there, I must've had a
half dozen cups of tea waiting for
something to happen, but nothing
did.  When I finally called for the
check, the waiter said it had already
been paid and handed me a lady's
card that smelled of Guerlain and
was printed with her name and ad-
dress-~an apartment on the Avenue
Foch.
     What a night, that first night!  I
had never made love in a four-poster
bed or used what Monique called
l'attar d'amour, love oil.  Her night-ta-
ble drawer was filled with sexual
paraphernalia, very scandalous, so
forbidden.  Although I was hardly a 
virgin, Monique was unlike any
woman I'd ever been with.  She was
demanding and uninhibited, the  op-
posite of how she appeared outside
the bedroom.  I was lucky to have
found such a kind and patient-~and
passionate-~patroness to teach me
about la vie amoureuse.  And she was
delighted I was well-mannered and
knew how to behave among her mon-
eyed coterie.
     Her husband worked too much and
was uninterested in sharing her flashy
social life.  Certainly he couldn't make
love for hours, the way I could.  She 
felt it was important to attend a din-
ner or the ballet with a man on her
arm, and her friends didn't seem to
mind if he was young and handsome.
Appearance was all they cared about
-~as long as I looked wonderful and
didn't say the wrong thing.  In this
circle, husbands had mistresses, and
wives had young male escorts, les
bons amis.  Everyone understood this
was perfectly acceptable, no questions
asked.
     The subject of money was handled 
discreetly.  Clumsy about it at first, I
asked Monique for 1,575 francs to
pay my hotel bill.  She seemed 
shocked, as if I had belched during
the final pas de deux of Swan Lake.
The next day, the concierge told me
everything was taken care of.  Thank-
ing Monique with words would have
been d~~class~~ (and vulgar negotia-
tions were equally inappropriate), but
that night l'attar d'amour came in
particularly handy.  This became our
established routine.  Monique also be-
gan giving me money to buy tulips
for her bedroom, making it clear I
shouldn't return the change, often a
handsome sum.
     I understood that if I transgressed
-~misbehaved in public, was seen at a
caf~~ with a girl-~I'd no longer be
welcome at her apartment, since these


actions could make her look foolish.
And when the affair was over, it was
over, without tears or recriminations.
She sent me a beautiful set of cuff
links and a silver-framed photograph
of herself.
     After Monique, I spent time with
other women who didn't care if sex
was involved-~they simply wanted
company-~though I certainly wasn't
expected to be carrying on with any-
one else.  With these women, keeping
up appearances was also essential.  In
public, I had to look devoted and
passionate; people assumed we were
having wild sex!
     By the time I reached twenty-eight,
I'd been through perhaps thirty of
these liaisons and the game was
played out.  Fortunately, for years I'd
been quietly investing my earnings,
until I had enough to finance my way
through the Sorbonne.  Those dear
women paid for my education.  After
I got my law degree, I represented 
many of them in their divorces.


The Working Boy
     While he was a student at Columbia
University, Patrick regularly sold him-
self sexually to women, not to finance
his education but to satisfy an intense
urge to rebel against a solid Republi-
can upbringing (he'd attended the
same boarding school as had his father
and grandfather).  He wanted to lead a
life of total debauchery and, he says,
"went after it heart and soul."

     The first time I had sex for money,
it was through an escort service, one
of the few that handle men for
women.  I wore a Brooks Brothers
suit and silk tie, like I was going for
an interview with some investment com-
pany, maybe Bear Stearns.  The 
woman was in New York on busi-
ness, and I was so excited about get-
ting paid for sex I just pounced on
her.  She paid only for an hour, but I
must've made love to her for three or
four.  I did everything to her because I
felt I had to put out 110 percent.
Judging by her chain of orgasms, she 
had a great time.  Afterward, when I
told the girl at the escort service
about my erotic marathon, she
laughed and said  I shouldn't be so
diligent or I'd wear myself out.
     I really like sex, so it was easy to
meet women.  Usually, I went for la-
dies in their forties.  We'd make eye
contact in a department store or at
the movies-~"Hello, how're you do-
ing?"-~and go from there to a bar or
coffee shop, sit around, talk.  They
usually didn't know right away they'd
have to pay me.  I wanted them to
feel we really hit it off and liked each

WAKEFIELD HALL [continued]

I found it hard to sleep that night, and
when at last I did, my sleep was laced with
troubling dreams, which, upon awakening,
I struggled to remember.  Shortly after
dawn, I realized it was useless to stay in
bed any longer.
     Still in my nightgown, I went into the
kitchen to make myself a cup of coffee,
staring at the circle of blue flame beneath
the throbbing kettle.  I realized with some
trepidation that I had not yet listened to
the tape of my interview with Lawrence
Brandt.  I did so-~once, then again.
     I walked to the window, gazing at the
austere cityscape as I sipped my coffee.
The telephone rang.
     I had expected it to be Jack-~it was a 
little past eight o'clock-~but was surprised
to hear Christina von Shouse's voice in-
stead.  "Hello, my dear," she said in a
friendly tone.  "I hope you don't mind my
calling at this hour."
     Not at all, I reassured her, waiting to
hear what could have prompted her call.
     "You saw him yesterday, I understand,"
she began.  "Lawrence Brandt.  You met
with him yesterday in the country, didn't
you?  And what did you think?  Was my as-
sessment correct?"
     I was amazed that she knew about my
appointment with Brandt but merely told
her that he had been extremely articulate
and helpful.
     "His wife left him not long ago, you
know" was her curious non sequitur-~in-
tended to unsettle me, no doubt.  "He was
devastated, I hear.  But then he should 
have expected it, the way he treated her!
Only Joanna knew how to bring out the
best in him.  He owes a great deal to her.
And to David.  They launched his career,
without question."
     I asked why she felt compelled to tell
me this.
     "To be helpful to you," she said after a
second's pause.  "I consider myself the only
person who really knew Joanna well.  All
aspects of her."
     I have lived in New York long enough
to question such "kindness" and told her
that she needn't be concerned:  All sides
would be carefully weighed.
     "In that case," she replied with a weary
laugh, "you might as well give up!"
     I asked her why it seemed impossible.
     "Because there are some things about
Joanna that no one will ever know."  She
paused.  "Except perhaps myself."
     "Things you know but will not tell me?"
I inquired.  "Or things that even you do not
know?"
     "Oh, my dear, there is little or nothing I
do not know!"  she retorted in her throaty
voice.
     "I see,"  I murmured, wondering pre-
cisely what she had meant.  For the mo-
ment, however, I had no intention of let-
ting her know she had piqued my curios-
ity.  "One thing continues to puzzle me," I
added as matter-of-factly as I could.  "Only
you seem to know about the last letter that
Joanna supposedly wrote David Cassel-~
the letter to be given to him after her
death."
     "No one else knows the truth," she re-
plied with icy authority.  "Joanna never hid
anything from me, you see.  She confided
in me as she did in no one else."  Her tone


     The night of Christina von Shouse's din-
ner arrived.  I had spent an inordinately
long time dressing, and was grateful for
the new red dress that I had reserved to
wear that night:  Even now I can recall the
feeling of the silk and the precise, shapely
way it was tucked across the hips and the
ribbons of red satin that edged its full, bil-
lowing sleeves and long skirt.
     My hair brushed, my diamond earrings
from Jack in place, I stood nervously be-
fore the mirror for a moment, not entirely
displeased. I fixed my lipstick, checked my
evening bag, and locked the door to my
apartment, taking a taxi to Christina's
apartment, my apprehension as intense as
my curiosity.  I was, as I recall, rather late.
     The slight, dark-haired maid whom I
remembered from the afternoon in August
took my cap.  "Please find your card," she
said with a slight nod, indicating the rows
of tiny white envelopes on a nearby con-
sole.  I found one with my name and
opened it. "Blue porcelain," it said:  my ta-
ble.  I moved to another console, where the
seating arrangement was re-created on a 
gilt-edged leather table plan.  I was seated
next to David Cassel, it seemed, which did
not displease me.  Tucking the card into my
handbag, I ordered a drink from one of
the roving waiters and walked into the 
drawing room.
     One glimpse was enough to convince
me this was an "important" dinner.  An
aura of confidence and self-congratulation
already permeated the atmosphere, the sort
that accompanies those who know they
have accepted the right invitation.
     Christina von Shouse approached in a
severe black dress, her neck looped with
lustrous gray pearls.  I could almost hear
her mentally assessing my own dress as she
kissed me on both cheeks.  "Chanel?"  she
asked at once.  I nodded.  "Ravishing," she
said with a glance that seemed almost in-
appropriately resolute.
     Placing her hand lightly on the small of
my back, she turned to me with customary
authority and said, "Come.  Let me intro-
duce you to everyone," as she led me
deeper into the room.
     Most of the names, however, I knew, as
people were introduced to me by turns.  I
heard myself talking and laughing, infused
by the hazy warmth of my kir royale;
speaking of politics one moment, of a re-
cently published book at another-~fulfill-
ing my obligation as a guest, in short, even
as I took in the room, its Russian decor at
its most splendid, and mused about the re-
lationship of the guests to the hostess.
     I continued to wend my way through
the crowd, spotting David Cassel in the
dark green armchair before the fireplace,
looking jaunty and appealing in black tie.
     He motioned to me.  I made my way to-
ward him.
     When David Cassel grasped my hand,
the firmness of his grip and the focus of
his eyes made me recall our first meeting
at Wakefield Hall.  "Come join me, Elisa-
beth," he said.  I did so, gathering my skirt
about me and saying something cheerful
and noncommittal-~I asked him about his
summer, mentioned that I was delighted to
be seated next to him-~even though I did 
not relish the idea of discussing the pro-
gress of my research that night.  Cassel now
appeared to me in such a different light!
    He went on to press me about the pro-

"YACHATS COVERED BRIDGE at left is
just one of 50 located in Oregon.  Folks are
surprised to learn our state has the most cov-
ered bridges west of the Mississippi River."

"BRIGHT GREEN FOLIAGE surrounds the
many tributaries that rush into the Santiam
River (shown at lower left), which flows
through the eastern part of Willamette Valley."

"FLOWER FARMS (right) make the Willa-
mette Valley a spectacular area to photo-
graph.  Poppies and daisies are just two of the
many flowers grown for their seeds here."

"SWEEPING VIEW below shows the Salmon
River Estuary meeting the Pacific Ocean at
Cascade Head.  I like to visit this area during
a low tide so the sandy beach is visible."

     For starters, both are married and have two children.  Kix
and his wife, Barbara, have a three-year-old son, Eric, and a
five-year-old daughter, Molly.  Ronnie has a 12-year-old
daughter, Whitney, and a 10-year-old son, J.W. (Jesse
Wayne), who both live with their mother, his ex-wife, in
Tulsa.  Ronnie and his wife, Janine, have no children from
their marriage, but Ronnie adds that he sees his kids from his
first marriage often, sometimes taking them on the road with
him.  Kix and Ronnie both reside in Nashville.
     One of the hardest things about their lifestyle as entertain-
ers, both also agree, is the time it means away from family.
"Barbara told me yesterday that my three-year-old fell down
and had to get eight stitches in his hand," says Kix.  "I wanted


this stuff that's happening to me now.  He missed all that."
     Both Kix and Ronnie also share, in their separate back-
grounds, a history of encouragement from certain members
of their respective families that helped inspire each of them
to follow his dream of musical success and stardom.


`Be a big fish in a big pond'

     "My dad always encouraged me to be a big fish in a big
pond," says Kix.  "I remember when I was getting out of high
school, I was thinking of asking him to cosign a note so I
could buy a bar in Shreveport.  I had a great local following
there, and I wanted to be the headliner.  He was like, `Get out
of here.  If you're serious about what you're doing, go for the
big time.  If you want to be in the music business, then be in
the music business.'"
     "My grandmother-~my dad's mother-~singled me out,"
says Ronnie.  "We were very poor growing up, and she sin-
gled me out from all the other grandkids for some reason.
She always said, `Don't let life keep you down.  You're spe-
cial.'  Just to have somebody telling you that is the key.  It
doesn't make you grow up thinking you're better than any-
body else, but it did push me through a lot of things in life.
She'd tell me, `Pull yourself out of the crowd.  Go! Go!'"
     Kix and Ronnie also discovered other similarities in their
childhoods.  Asked about their favorite boyhood toy, they
both reply, almost in unison: "A BB gun!"
     "A Daisy!" says Kix, recalling the specifics.  "Winchester
style.  I can remember, day after day, taking off by myself
with my BB gun in the woods...."
     "Me, too!" says Ronnie excitedly.  "I'd get home from
school, grab my pellet gun and head for the woods to go blue
jay hunting."
     "Shoot all the sparrows you want," says Kix, repeating an
instruction he no doubt heard often, "but no cardinals."
     "Blue jays," continues Ronnie.  "We could nail the blue
jays.  They were bad.  But I remember the first time I shot a

parade and games for children.

Getting started on
your dream kitchen

Designing your own kitchen can be an
exciting exercise in self-discovery.  Get out
your pencil and paper and start planning.

1. List your dreams.  Write down
everything about every kitchen idea you've
ever liked.  Include magazine clippings, color
swatches and other bits of inspiration.

2. List your needs. Take inventory of your
lifestyle.  Do you have enough cabinet space?
Is your refrigerator too crowded?  Do you
spend a lot of time cleaning up?  Is your
kitchen too dark?

3. Choose a floor plan that's right for
you:  L-shaped: Forms a natural triangle.
Protects the cook from cross traffic.  Corridor:
Space-efficient but prone to traffic jams.
Island: Requires a big kitchen but serves a
variety of needs.  Peninsula: Good for routing 
traffic and defining informal dining area.

The next step

Once you've established your priorities, take
your lists to a contractor, architect or kitchen
and bath designer.  And don't forget to stop 
by your local Frigidaire dealer.  Regardless of
who designs or remodels your kitchen, you
will have to select the appliances, and that's
where Frigidaire makes your task easy.
You'll be amazed at how these appliances
fulfill all your kitchen dreams and needs.

What is UltraStyle design?

People don't have sharp corners; appliances
shouldn't either.  Eliminating the edges,
corners and creases also eliminates traps for
dirt and grease.  The rounded edges blend in
better with all decors.  These smooth edges
showcase fine craftsmanship, and the
superior attention to detail on the outside is
but a prelude to the high-quality engineering
on the inside.

Products that work for you

The new Frigidaire with UltraStyle design is
built for the way you live today.  Frigidaire's
leadership in people-focused designs has but
one goal:  to make your life better by making
your kitchen tasks easier, more convenient
and less time-consuming.  Here's how:


Refrigerators

With roomy and fully adjustable interiors,
Frigidaire top-freezer and side-by-side 
refrigerators allow you to store and retrieve
food easily.  Seamless designs, inside and
out, make cleaning easier and less necessary.
And Frigidaire's commitment to energy-
efficient designs and reduced-CFC insulation
leads the field in environmental excellence.

Ranges

For precise cooking performance on demand
throughout their long lives, you can't beat
Frigidaire's electric ranges.  The smooth
cooktops and upswept designs eliminate
cracks and crevices that trap food and
grease.  Frigidaire also offers a full
complement of gas ranges with European-
style sealed burners for easy cleaning.  In 
addition, you'll find a full line of built-in
wall ovens and electric and sealed burner
cooktopsthat fit nine out of 10 existing 
appliance cutouts.

Dishwashers

With Frigidaire's new UltraPowerTM wash
system you will never need to pre-rinse
again.  Powerful rinsing jets surge water
through the dishwasher to remove even the
toughest baked-on foods.  A food disposer
chops up debris and sends it down the
drain.  A super-fine filter ensures that only
the cleanest water ever touches your dishes.
Frigidaire's dishwashers not only work hard,
they look good too, because the sleek
UltraStyle design blends with any kitchen
design, no matter what your style.

Microwave ovens

From popcorn to roast beef, Frigidaire
microwave ovens take the guesswork out of
cooking.  A unique 1,000-watt power system,
a browning element and a turntable ensure
you handle every cooking chore with tasty
results.  Your meals cook up to 25 percent
faster than in conventional microwave ovens.
The UltraStyle design with curved edges 
creates a distinctive look that complements
any decor.  Models are available in three
sizes and in an over-the-range design
including a range hood.

'CROSS COUNTRY


ADIRONDACK ANTIQUES

On September 25, more than 50 antiques
dealers will gather for the second annual
Adirondack Antiques Show.  Held on the
grounds of the Adirondack Museum in
Blue Mountain Lake, N.Y., the show will
feature newly crafted furniture and acces-
sories as well as American antiques that
emphasize the distinctive rustic style of
the region.  New to the show this year:
Adirondack fiddler Vic Kibbler-~whom
the Smithsonian Institution recently
named the premier fiddler in the United
States-~will perform throughout the day.


THE DECADE THAT 
   ROARED

It was the age of bobbed hair, dance mar-
athons, and flagpole sitting.  Beaded dress-
es and raccoon coats were all the rage.
Movie stars became royalty, and athletes,
heroes.  The Herbert Hoover Library and
Museum in West Branch, Iowa, pays trib-
ute to the colorful culture of the early 20th
century's uproarious decade with "The
Roaring Twenties," an exhibit showcasing
more than 400 period objects.  Included
are film clips, Al Capone's fedora, a bat
autographed by Babe Ruth, and Louis
Armstrong's trumpet.


Mah-jongg was a popular '20s pastime.


CELEBRATING 200 YEARS

To mark their town's bicentennial, 30
women from Cazenovia, N.Y., gathered 
with sewing needles in hand to stitch a
commemorative quilt.  Before presenting it
to their town, however, the women (some
of whom had never quilted before) entered
their creation in this year's American
Quilter's Society Show and Contest.  It
won second prize in the group com-
petition.  Local children caught the
quilting bug, too, producing a nine- by
15-foot quilt that will be shown at the
town's Bicentennial Country Fair on Sep-
tember 18.  Also at the fair:  demonstra-


tions, crafts, and food.

SAMPLING the great-tasting corn rec-
ipes entered in our recent contest had
Country Woman's panel of judges grin-
ning from ear to ear. (Sorry...I couldn't
resist just one "corny" line!)
     Honestly, our taste-testers had plen-
ty to smile about as they savored the
golden corn casseroles, chowders, muf-
fins, fritters, relishes, salads and side
dishes shared by subscribers.
      When the last kernels were cleaned
from the plates and the votes tallied,
Fresh Corn Salad from Carol Shaffer
of Cape Girardeau, Missouri took top
honors, earning high marks for its tangy,


fresh flavor and its eye-appealing colors.
     Carol was delighted when I phoned
her with the good news.  "I make this
corn salad often for family get-togeth-
ers," she told me.  "It's always a hit at in-
formal outdoor barbecues, too.  I love
recipes that call for homegrown ingre-
dients-~next to cooking, gardening is
one of my favorite hobbies."
     She's had lots of experience at both,
I learned.  Raised in a rural area, Carol
was helping her mother prepare family
suppers and put up produce by age 10.
     "Mom and I still cook together often
and always team up to prepare family
meals on holidays and birthdays," Car-
ol informed.  "We also get together to 
swap and test out recipes we've clipped
from magazines and newspapers.
     "Between us, we have 30 cookbooks
and files full of recipes-~too many to
count!"
     Counting on tasting them all is Car-
ol's husband-to-be, Danny.  "We're get-
ting married this summer, in time to
tend to and harvest our first mutual
garden," Carol related.  "We'll grow
cucumbers, peas, carrots, okra, toma-
toes and, of course, corn."
     Gardening, cooking and a full-time


job as a seamstress keep her busy, but
Carol assured there's always time for
Fresh Corn Salad.  "It tastes best when
you make it ahead and let it sit in the
refrigerator overnight," she said.  "Then
just put it in your picnic cooler and go!"
     Credit goes to her mother, Carol
added, for her entering CW's corn rec-
ipe contest.  "I'd nearly forgotten about
it when Mom reminded me of the ap-
proaching deadline.  I sat right down
and wrote out my entry, never dream-
ing I'd win!"
     Win she did, and soon she and three
guests will be enjoying her Grand Prize
free dinner at a favorite restaurant.
     I can't wait to hear all about it after-
ward.  You might say I'm all ears!  ~~


All Eyes'll Be on This Ear of Corn


EVERYBODY likes to spread a pat or
two of butter on a steaming ear of corn
on the cob.  But butter inside the ear?
     That's the fun behind this bright new
butter dish I recently came across-~it's
shaped and colored just like a nice fresh
ear of sweet corn straight off the stalk!
     It added lots of laughter to our CW
kitchen during testing for the corn rec-
ipe contest.  And it will do the same for
your summer get-togethers...and, for
that matter, meals all year long.
     There's no fooling when it comes to
the quality of this dish, however.  Made
of glazed pottery, it retains its vibrant
green and yellow colors through many

out the possibility of pneumonia or some
other respiratory ailment.  And before the
night was out, I performed a spinal tap in
hopes of ruling out meningitis.
   The spinal fluid showed no signs of
meningitis.  The chest X-ray was clean.
The mono test was negative.  A blood
count showed that Caitlin had a surpris-
ingly normal number of white blood 
cells-~the number should have been at
least twice as high in someone with an in-
fection as severe as Caitlin's appeared to 
be.  A few of the results were slightly off:
she had a somewhat low level of sodium
and a borderline-low protein level in her
blood, and her liver appeared to be work-
ing a little bit harder than usual.  Unfor-
tunately, these are nonspecific findings.


tests made it seem unlikely that she had a
viral infection or toxic shock syndrome.
Equally important, though, they didn't
rule out Rocky Mountain spotted fever:
for unknown reasons, the white blood cells
don't initially respond to this infection the
way they do to most others, so early blood
counts are often normal in these patients.
And though Caitlin didn't yet have the
characteristic rash found in more than
three-quarters of spotted fever cases and
she didn't remember a tick bite, the rest 
of her symptoms fit-~headache, fever,
nausea, muscle aches, lethargy.
     Rocky Mountain spotted fever is an
infection caused by the bacterium Rick-
ettsia rickettsii, which grows inside the


cells of ticks and mammals.  Ticks can
pick up the bug by feasting on the blood
of an already-infected rabbit or rodent,
and they can pass it on to their offspring.
The disease was so named because Rocky
Mountain spotted fever was first reported 
in states such as Montana and Idaho.
Ironically, it is now predominantly an Ap-
palachian disease:  the majority of cases are 
found in the Carolinas, Georgia, Mary-
land, Virginia, and Tennessee, though it
can be found almost anywhere in the
country (a large number of cases are re-
ported in Oklahoma, for instance).  The 
fever itself comes from the bite of an in-
fected tick-~wood ticks in western states,
dog ticks in southeastern states-~or from 
crushing one of these ticks on skin that


complications: encephalitis, pneumonia, 
kidney failure, shock.  If it goes untreated,
Rocky Mountain spotted fever can kill as
many as 20 percent of the people it strikes;
even when treated, 6 to 7 percent of pa-
tients still succumb.
   That's why my hunch didn't stop me
from worrying about Caitlin.  And I'll ad-
mit I worried a little bit more when the
sensitive blood tests for antibodies to
Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spot-
ted fever came back-~both were negative.
     This sort of situation emphasizes the
occasional conflict between the art and
science of medicine, the battle between
instinct and technology.  In my gut, I knew
what Caitlin had.  But in my hands were


test results telling me something else.
Keeping in mind that it can take as many
as four weeks for patients with this infec-
tion to develop the antibodies these tests 
look for, I decided to go with my gut.
     I had already started Caitlin on two
intravenous antibiotics.  One was a drug
that penetrates into most body fluids and
tissues and is effective against a broad
spectrum of bacterial infections.  The 
other was doxycycline, an antibiotic that
has a good track record in treating dis-
ease caused by unusual bugs like Rick-
ettsia and the Lyme bug, Borrelia burg-
dorferi.  In addition, I ordered IV fluids,
painkillers, and acetaminophen for her
fever.  Then there was nothing to do but
watch and wait.  Patience is a virtue for
both doctors and patients, though ar-
guably easier for the former.

ON HER SECOND HOSPITAL DAY,
Caitlin's condition worsened. She
continued to spike high fevers and she
became increasingly confused.
     "Are you feeling any better?" I asked
her at one point.
     "Huh?" was her only answer.  Repeat-
ing the question didn't help.  Eventually I
did get her to answer a few simple ques-
tions-~she told me her name and knew
that the woman by her bed was her
mother-~but she couldn't tell me what day
of the week it was or even the month.  She
was frighteningly weak for such a young
woman, despite the care of family and
friends constantly huddled around her bed.
They reminded me of covered wagons,
circling around to defend against an en-


me to pull magic out of my black bag
when all I could offer them was hope.
     On her third hospital day-~the Fourth
of July, as it happened-~Caitlin's hands
and feet became puffy.  Even though she
still wasn't responding to the antibiotics,
I was encouraged.  This was the sign I was
looking for.  By that evening, a faint pink
rash had appeared on her wrists and an-
kles-~a very fine rash under the skin, the
kind of rash you can see but can't feel.  A
Rocky Mountain spotted fever rash.  So
on July Fourth, Caitlin and I celebrated-~
not independence but diagnosis.
     By the next morning the rash had be-
come a darker shade of red, and it began
to move from her hands and feet to her

drama to be witnessed at small
Southern Black colleges' com-

auditorium is jam-packed (and it
usually is also hot).  Of course, the
graduating class is seated facing the
stage, and their families usually are
seated as a bloc at rear right.  Among
the grandfatherly aged men-~often
farmers-~a goodly percentage are
wearing what is probably their only 
suit, and the grandmotherly ladies
are wearing their choicest Sunday
frocks.

there like graven images, staring 
straight ahead at wondrous happen-


ings up on the stage.  It may well be
their first time ever on any college's

for attending any college was even

     And that is why their grandchild

is seated somewhere up front,

with the fact that very likely it's the

FAMILY AMUSEMENTS


about electronic gear of all kinds carried on
by passengers and used in flight.  Lap-top
computers, Nintendo Game Boys, cellular
phones, videocassette recorders-~all of
these products are coming under scrutiny.
     The threat is a double-whammy.  There
are concerns that explosive devices could 
be hidden in the circuitry of electronics
and that airport X-ray inspections are not
sophisticated enough to detect them.  A
plastic explosive tucked away inside a
portable radio destroyed Pan Am flight
103 over Scotland in 1988.
     More likely, however, is the admittedly
bizarre-sounding risk that electromag-
netic signals emitted by the devices could
interfere with the navigational gadgetry of
aircraft.  Odd as that seems, some pilots
have reported planes veering off course
and gauges going haywire, attributable,
they suspect, to passengers using elec-
tronics.  In one case, a pilot reported that
some instrumentation dials dimmed sud-
denly and the needles spun around wildly
on a flight departing Chicago.  Then the
plane began flying off course.  It turned
out a passenger in row nine was using a
lap-top computer.  After he switched it off,
the panel light brightened and the naviga-


gizmos are, in fact, a risk.  No one knows
for sure that those devices are what
caused the dysfunctional mechanics.
     "There is no definitive answer yet on 
most electronic devices," says Hank Price, a
spokesperson for the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA).  "With cellular 
phones, some studies show they have inter-
fered with some portions of flights, but we
are not sure how and why and where, only
that they have the potential to do so."
     The Federal Communications Com-
mission prohibits the use of cellular
phones while planes are airborne; most
airlines don't allow passengers to use
them at all, even when the planes are on
the ground.  (An aircraft's own devices,
including video screens for movies and
audio systems for earphones and tele-
phones, have been designed to conform
with the navigational system, so they do
not pose a problem.)
     The Air Transport Association (ATA),
which represents the major U.S. airlines
in Washington, requested industry-wide
standards from the FAA on other elec-
tronic devices.  The FAA, however, issued
an advisory earlier this year leaving it up
to airlines to decide.  Meanwhile, an advi-

ing to achieve both.  If you want to control thick


stay out late.  I don't think it's good for children."
     The flip side to parenting is knowing when to let go.
"A child has to have an opportunity to make mistakes,"
Mrs. Clinton says, "so she can mature.  Trying to find that
balance is the history of good parenting, and all of us are
struggling to meet it."
     As Chelsea has grown, she has been given more re-
sponsibilities.  Restrictions on TV viewing have been re-
laxed.  And her parents promised her that the summer
after her 13th birthday she could have her ears pierced if
she wanted to.  "P-day is fast approaching," jokes Hillary.
     Last year Chelsea was also allowed to choose the
church she wanted to join.  The President is a Southern
Baptist; Mrs. Clinton is Methodist.  Chelsea went to both
and decided to be confirmed at her mother's church.
     Now that she's 13, Chelsea also chooses her own
clothes-~fortunately, as it turned out on her first day of
school in Washington.  "I used to like it a lot better when
she'd wear what I bought her," Mrs. Clinton says, laugh-
ing.  "For her first day of school I wanted her to wear this
cute outfit [pants and a matching top] I'd bought her."
     "Oh, Mother, I can't wear that," Chelsea told her.
     "I make the big argument," Mrs. Clinton recalls, "and
she said, `Nobody will be wearing anything like that.'"
     And, of course, Chelsea, who wore the teenage uni-


form of jeans and a sweatshirt, was right.  She looked like 
everyone else and was quickly accepted.  Within three
weeks, she was having sleepovers with friends.
     Hillary Clinton describes her father, Hugh, as "Mr.
Reality Check."  But she says he's "become one of the
most indulgent grandparents.  I used to go to my father
and say: `Dad, I really need a new pair of shoes.  My shoes
have holes in them,' and he'd say, `Have you done your
chores?  Have you done this?  Have you done that?'  Chel-
sea goes to their house, and he says, `Chelsea, I want to
give you something.'"
     Dorothy Rodham elaborates on the story:  "Chelsea's
grandfather, to put it nicely, was thrifty with his own kids,
but he always gives Chelsea $5 when she comes to visit.
When she came home with all A's, he gave her $20.  And
Hillary said to him: `All you ever said to me when I came
home with A's was, "You must be at an easy school."'"
     Chelsea is still the only grandchild, "a sore point with
the grandmothers," Mrs. Clinton says.  "I would have
loved to have had more children, but it just didn't work
out, so I have the best child there is."
     The Clintons celebrate holidays with a large extended
family-~there are lots of cousins, particularly on the Pres-
ident's side-~and with many very close friends.
     "We go pretty far to celebrate every major holiday,"
says Mrs. Clinton.  "Bill goes crazy hiding Easter eggs.
He always finds great places.  Now, he'll have more rooms
to torment us in."
     Christmas is the family's most important holiday.  "We
all go overboard," Mrs. Clinton says.  "We have carol
singing.  We have a big family party where we make every-


one act out the 12 days of Christmas.  They put on paper
antlers while they sing `Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Rein-
deer.'  We are so corny when it comes to these things."
     They also bake chocolate-chip cookies-~the now fam-
ous recipe that became a symbol of the traditional side of
Hillary Rodham Clinton, the side that has nothing to do 
with being one of the top lawyers in the country or the
chair of the President's Health Care Reform Taskforce.  In
fact, Mrs. Clinton says baking cookies is a Christmas eve
tradition.  She still does the baking with Chelsea.
     And she is still not certain why people have trouble
seeing her as a mother, as well as a successful profession-
al woman.  "I think people should be able to show all their
sides," she reflects. "I think women are being seen in
their various roles and are asking that all of those roles be
respected.  There shouldn't be any one stereotype."
     By the time Chelsea grows up, Mrs. Clinton expects
the matter to be less controversial.  "The double standard
is eroding," she says.  What she wants for her daughter is
what every parent wants:  "to be someone who has
enough of a sense of herself and the confidence to go with
it to make whatever choices are best suited for her.
     "I think the greatest gift you can give children is to help
them develop self-respect and the skills valuable to them,
so they can be the people God meant them to be."  ~

and the buck fell and the rest of the antelope ran.
     That ancient loneliness turned out to be quite addictive,
though over the years it's become harder to find.  More
hunters have come into this corner of the desert, and
while most of them stick to plainly tracked roads, some
bring all-terrain vehicles and ride into the edges of the 
rougher hills.  They don't kill many antelope, but they
push them back.  I still hunt this country with my wife,
Eileen, but now we bring packframes to haul our antelope
out of the far canyons, the same packframes we use for
bigger game in the mountains.  It's tougher, but we still
find our loneliness.
     Four years after we started these long treks to the
empty places, we took Eileen's son Sean along.  He
lived, for the most part, with his father near the Idaho
border, and though he'd hunted for three years, he
didn't yet have the combination of patience and quick-
ness needed to kill a timber deer, let alone an elk.  He


was discouraged, so we took him out where the
deer and the antelope play, setting up camp at the
high end of a long ridge overlooking the edge of
the badlands.
     We dug a pit in the sand, built a fire, and
cooked elk steaks.  The sky turned slate and the
three-quarter moon singled out the buttes as if 
they were cut from gray paper.  Even in the moon-
light, we saw more stars than you ever might, the
horizons wide as oceans and far from city lights.
The Milky Way was not just a flat line but some-
thing nearly tactile, like flakes of mica suspended
in black ice.  We ate our steaks and heard coyotes,
and told Sean about the antelope we'd find and
where we'd find them.
     The next morning the moon was down and the
sun well up when we left camp, our daypacks full of


lunch and water on our packframes.  We headed across a
series of washes toward the long low line of red clay we
call the China Wall, 2 miles from camp.  On the other side
of the Wall is a little unroaded valley, in which lies one of
the few natural ponds in this northern desert, fed by an al-
kaline spring that grows cattails and geese.  The pond al-
ways has fresh pronghorn tracks around it.
     On the way to the Wall we found a desert tragedy: four
rabbit feet and a white cotton tail.  No tracks were set in
the hard sand to tell us if it was the work of a coyote or
golden eagle.  We crossed a dry wash, and over the hill
found a single doe pronghorn, which Sean turned down,
wanting a buck.  Eileen stalked and shot it at 75 yards.
After field-dressing the doe, we draped it belly-up over a
tall sage to cool, tying orange ribbon on the sagebrush to
mark the place and keep birds away.
     Then we crossed the Wall at the gap near the east
end.  From there we could see the (Continued on page 97)

that have produced for me, and that oth-
er experimenters have told me about.
The Flatfish in the smaller F7 size
(about 21/2 inches long) is a great com-
promise for both large and small trout in
lakes or streams.  It can be cast or trolled.
     The Jointed Pikie, introduced seventy
years ago, may sound absurd, but in mod-
est sizes (3 to 4 inches) this old floater-
diver is a lethal dose for trout.  In streams,
it's on par with the Flatfish.  Another ex-
tremely productive lure type, and the
technique for using it, was divulged to me
by an Eastern angler.  He used a minnow-
like floater-diver.  There are many of 
these, and they're tremendously popular
and effective nowadays for bass.  Rapala,
Rebel, Bagley, Cordell, and many other
manufacturers make these models.  Those 
about 4 inches long are fine.
     "I've been taking rainbows of 4 pounds
up in lakes by casting a 4-inch minnow-
imitating floater with a short plastic lip.
After it splashes down, I let it lie until the
circles, on flat water, begin to smooth out.
Then I jerk the lure under, crank twice,
and let it rise and lie again briefly.  I've also
used this same technique successfully on
large streams, casting upstream to the head
of a long, smooth-surfaced pool.  As the


lure floats back, jerk it under, but don't
crank.  Just take up slack and repeat.  Colors
and shapes resembling those of disabled
fish clinch the sale on floater-divers."
     Two classes of trout anglers will dis-
dain the bass plug routine:  bait fisher-
men, and purist fly fishermen, neither of
whom are likely to budge.  The average
angler sees trout rise, or reads the vast ar-
ray of fly-fishing literature, and is brain-
washed into thinking that dry, wet, and
nymph flies are what take trout, along
with the occasional streamer or spinner.
One fly-fishing addict boasted that any-
thing I could do with a plug, he could do
with flies, including big streamers.
     He may have been correct.  Fly fishing is
my favorite discipline, too.  But off-trail ex-
periments have always intrigued me, and
occasionally the off-trail approach wins
the race.  For example, the last time my
family and I went through Yellowstone
Park it was September.  We were headed
for the south exit, and we stopped for
lunch beside Lewis Lake, which was glass-
flat, stippled intermittently by rises of sub-
stantial trout.  I yearned for one fish with
which to make a last trout supper before
returning home to Texas.
     Donning waders, I walked out as far as


possible, and laid down dries, wets,
nymphs, and finally a streamer.  Still
goose-egged after 2 hours, I thought
with irritation, I'll put a stop to this non-
sense.  I rigged a spinning rod.  There were
no lure restrictions at the time, so I tied
on a lipped, minnow-type plug, made a
long cast, and then followed the routine
I'd learned.  After jerking once as the plug
came back to the surface, I thought I saw
minor water movement nearby.  I gently
jiggled the lure.  For the next few minutes
the limber rod was half-circled, water
kept sloshing and flying, and my heart 
was thumping.  With smiling satisfac-
tion, I finally beached the trout, a brown
of approximately 3 pounds.
     Driving on south, I was inwardly
chuckling, thinking of old Father
Finegan, and how years ago he'd consid-
ered that big brown sinfully caught.
Most likely, he was gracefully arcing his
beloved fly rod over pollution-free wa-
ters in a better place nowadays.  I won-
dered if he knew about that bright yel-
low plug with red and black polka dots,
about the Jointed Pikie, or what had just

     Diana shuddered.  Wills and Harry had
been scheduled to be there, but the night
before both had come down with chick-
enpox.  The surviving Windsors had been
devastated.  Dear old Queen Mum had
succumbed from the terrible shock.  Yet,
some good had come of it:  Andrew and
Fergie had been reunited by the catas-
trophe.  Both came to realize the impor-
tance of a good marriage, and decided to
work hard to maintain theirs.  Princess
Anne, Di's sister-in-law, had been a bul-
wark, arguing successfully that Diana be
made Regent of the underage King. Eng-
land had not had a boy king in centuries, 
and Diana was more than well aware
that though she was not an intellectual,
suddenly the very existence of the
monarchy depended upon her.  She
prayed, and then she relied upon her
instincts, which to her great surprise,
proved extremely sound.
     And now her job was over.  On July 15,
2004, William was crowned King of
England.  Diana smiled to herself.  Her
son looked so handsome in his ermine-
trimmed robes.  The country would be in
good hands, and the next job would be to
find a wife for Wills.  How very much
she wanted him to fall in love, like she
had, once, so long ago.
     She turned at the knock upon her door.
"My dears!" she greeted her sons.  "This
is a surprise..."  Her voice died in her
throat when she noticed her paramour,
Lord James X, was with them.
     William, always quick to the point,
said, "James tells me that you two are in
love, Mother.  He has asked my permis-
sion to marry you.  I thought you should 
know that Harry and I could not be more
delighted.  You have our blessing."  Then
the King pulled his younger brother by
the arm, and they departed the room.
     "I could not wait," Lord X said softly.
"I am glad you did not," Diana replied,
flying into his warm, welcoming arms
as they closed around her.

waiting for.  This one certainly had been.


watched Charles watching the riots, she
suddenly saw him as he'd been during
their engagement:  proud, confident, de-
termined to be the best king that Eng-
land had ever known.  And in that mo-
ment of reckoning, Diana also admitted
to herself the folly of much of her own
behavior during their endless battles.
They had fought a war, and, in the end,
they had both lost.
     Diana turned away from the TV and
started walking toward the door.  Then
she began to run.  Behind her, Yuri
guessed her intention and called out,
"Diana, don't be a fool!  It would take a 
miracle to put Charles on the throne!"
     The door slammed behind her.
     Charles looked up in angry surprise as
Diana walked into his study. "What the
hell are you doing here?" he demanded,
studying her face for signs of triumph at

     Diana smiled.  "I've come to return
something I took away from you."
     His voice rang with angry sarcasm.
"What's that?"
     "A throne," his wife said somberly.
     Charles's fury at her-~and himself-~
dissolved as he noticed the softness in
her eyes and the maturity in her face.  He
knew what she was offering as clearly
as he knew his affair with Camilla was 
over.  "I don't deserve your help," he
admitted, his voice awkward.
     Diana laughed. "You're right," she said.
     She held out her hand to him.
     And he took it.

more appropriately bestowed on the
dead. Nonetheless, Dave Marr, Char-
lie Mechem, Sean Connery, Herb
Wind and the other captains were hop-
ing for a live demigod this year to fol-
low the late Joe Dey. Nicklaus chairs
the meeting but, theoretically, has no
vote. "You might say this time," Marr
said, "he gave us a little push."
  When Jack spoke up to announce
there was a name he wanted to toss
into the mix, none of them could have
guessed the one he had in mind.
"Sooner or later, we're going to have to
get into the modern era," he told them.
"I know the policy is not to honor any-
one still competing, but Arnold Palmer
is not going to stop completely until
he's 85."
  The captains looked around at each
other with raised eyebrows and soft
smiles. The motion was made and
passed by acclamation. "I better call
him myself," Nicklaus said, remem-
bering Hogan. When Palmer came to
the phone, he couldn't answer immedi-
ately. He had to compose himself and
call back. The answer was yes.
  Furthermore, they would play in
each other's tournaments for the first
time in nine years. (They would miss
each other's cuts, to be sure, and
make their own at the same time, but
there was a grace in that, too.)
  "We've gone out of our way to re-
new our friendship," Nicklaus said,
"to have dinners together again."
  At The Tradition, a senior event,
Palmer knocked Nicklaus over by ask-
ing him to look at his swing. "We've
played 30 years," Jack murmured, "and
that's the first time he's ever asked me. I
was flattered by it, but he must really
be desperate. Seriously, I'd been want-
ing to say something. I know he's
strong as an ox, but sometimes he
moves a little far away from the ball. I
tried to get him to let his arms hang a
little more. I can remember, all those
years ago, when he told me an ordi-
nary putt from just off the green usual-
ly beats a good chip. I don't know how
many times I've thought of that." Any-
way, they were sharing again.

Answers to the
questions moms ask
most about their
children's nutrition
-~picky eaters,
vitamin supple-
ments, junk food,
and much more


Eating Right


Q. My four year old is a picky
eater. I don't think he's ever
willingly eaten a vegetable-~
except French fries! Should
I insist that he eat certain foods?

A. No. Don't force your son to eat
anything. That's the wrong way to
go. Offer him a variety of foods,
incorporate vegetables into meals
in new ways, or use fruits instead.
Did you know that four year olds
are known for their single-minded
eating patterns? At this age, some
children insist on one food for a
period of time, then suddenly
switch to another-~so there is every
reason to encourage new tastes.

Q. My five-month-old baby has
been breast-feeding exclusively.
My friends now tell me she's ready
for cereal. Are they correct?

A. Yes. The American Academy
of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends
that solids be introduced at four to
six months. Check with your
pediatrician.

Q. Because my neighbor worries
a lot about her weight, she gives


were not overweight as young
children, and eating patterns
change greatly between childhood
and adulthood.

Q. What percentage of a child's
diet should come from fat?

A. Approximately 30 percent, the
same as for adults.

Q. My pediatrician wants to
check my nine year old's
cholesterol. Is this necessary?

A. Your pediatrician probably
sees a particular reason for this
test. Current AAP guidelines
recommend screening for choles-
terol when there is a history
of early heart or vascular disease
or high blood-cholesterol levels
in one or both parents. Testing is
also recommended when a
youngster has high blood pressure,
diabetes, or is overweight-~all risk
factors for developing heart
disease.

Q. Should children take vitamin
supplements?

A. There is no real need for the
average infant or child over age one
to have vitamin supplements. An
exception to this rule is the breast-
		continued on page 208


be weaned at any time, but we recom-
mend breast-feeding through as much of
the infant's first year as possible.

Q. How often should a newborn be fed?
A. Feeding a newborn is a compromise
between on demand and what's possible
for the mother. On average, babies are
fed every two to three hours.

Q. My ten-year-old daughter's appetite
has recently jumped up considerably.
Suddenly she's asking for second help-
ings and nibbling after school. Why this
change?
A. The average ten-year-old girl is about
to go through a phenomenal growth
spurt. Your daughter is eating more be-
cause girls grow rapidly as their hormones
shift toward adolescence and the onset of
menstruation and puberty begins.

Q. My friend makes all her own baby
food. Is her child better nourished as a
result?
A. No. Commercially prepared baby
food is a perfectly acceptable choice for
parents to make.

Q. How important is fruit in a child's
diet?
A. Fruit has vitamins, minerals, fiber,
and can supply a child with energy. You
find the same nutrients in other foods,
but fruit is tasty and low-fat, too.

Q. Obesity runs in my husband's fam-
ily, and my seven-year-old son has a big
appetite. How can I limit his diet with-
out turning into a nag?
A. If he is growing consistently and his
weight is not far out of line for his
height, there may be no reason to be
concerned. At seven, active children eat
to meet their growth and energy needs.
However, if your pediatrician tells you
that your child is quite heavy for his
height, you may want to think about
lower-calorie alternatives to some of his
favorite foods. But don't nag and don't
worry. Emphasize the value of exercise
and try to provide the right balance of
foods.

Q. During busy workweeks, making
meals is difficult. My children love fast-
food dinners, but I worry about relying
on "junk." How bad is a steady take-out-
diet?
A. There is nothing wrong with take-out
food as long as you don't order the same
thing all the time. Pizza and hamburgers,
in particular, can have lots of fat and
salt. So order pizza one night, then
turkey or broiled chicken sandwiches the
next, and after that hamburgers or pizza
(without the extra cheese, pepperoni, or
sausage that adds fat). Round out the
meals with a salad and offer plenty of
fruit.

Q. Is it true that eating rice or drinking
the water in which rice has been cooked
will help a child recover from diarrhea?
A. In third-world countries, when chil-

ufacturer's instructions. Pack the gelato
tightly into six ~~~-cup dariole or other
molds, cover each mold with plastic wrap,
and freeze the gelato for 30 minutes, or un-
til it is ready to be served.
  Make the blackberry sauce: In a heavy
saucepan melt the sugar over moderate
heat, stirring with a fork, and cook the syr-
up, swirling the pan occasionally, until it is
a golden caramel. Working carefully and
quickly, stir in the water, the blackberries,
the lemon juice, and the cr~~me de cassis
(the mixture will bubble up), stirring until
the mixture is combined well, and cook the
mixture over moderately low heat until the
caramel is dissolved. Strain the mixture
through a fine sieve set over a bowl, press-
ing hard on the solids, and chill the sauce,
covered, until it is cold.
  Divide the sauce among 6 dessert plates,
unmold the gelato, and arrange it in the cen-
ter of the plates. Garnish each serving with
some of the mango and the blackberries.
Serves 6.

lemon juice). You could put some into your
vegetable soup, of course, or make corn
chowder.
  If unexpected company arrives, impress
your guests with a salad of corn, red pep-
pers, black beans, and avocado, to which
you might add crab meat (if you live near
the ocean or have come into an inheritance)
or cold leftover chicken or some saut~~ed
shrimp. On a bed of greens this makes a
beautiful lunch, and with the addition of a
nice goat cheese and a loaf of bread you
needn't serve another thing.
  One of the easiest and most savory reci-
pes for corn off the cob comes from Ishmail
Merchant's Indian Cuisine. Mr. Merchant
is a film producer and a man around the
kitchen. Although not long on text, this
very personal book demonstrates how one
person fused the traditions he grew up with
and those of his adopted homeland. His
cayenned-corn recipe must be made with
fresh corn, and it is worth waiting a whole
year for.

	ISHMAIL MERCHANT'S
	CAYENNED CORN ~

1. Cut as much uncooked fresh corn as you
have mouths to feed. (For 4 people you will
need about 4 or 5 ears of corn.)
2. Melt 3 tablespoons of butter in a skillet
and add the corn, a couple of chopped-up
garlic cloves, ~~~ teaspoon cayenne (or more
if you like heat), and salt to taste. Cook this
mixture a few minutes over medium heat.
3. Add ~~~ cup cream (half-and-half or even
milk will do), cook the mixture for another
8 minutes or so, and serve it hot. Serves 4.

  This multicultural dish is mellow and
sweet as well as spicy and suave. With a
side dish of basmati rice it is pure heaven.
  If you are feeding friends from other
countries, corn fritters are what you are
looking for. Because they are no longer
fashionable you can even find red-blooded
Americans who haven't eaten them since
childhood.

	CORN FRITTERS

1. In a bowl stir 2 cups water and ~~~ cup
olive oil, a little at a time, into 2 cups all-
purpose flour seasoned with a generous
pinch of salt, stir in 1 large egg yolk, and
stir the batter until it is smooth.
2. Whip 1 large egg white until it is just
stiff, fold it into the batter, and let the batter
stand for 1 hour.
3. Stir 3~~~ cups uncooked fresh corn (cut
from about 6 large ears) into the batter.
4. In a large deep skillet heat about 1 inch of


olive oil or light sesame oil with a garlic
clove over medium high heat until the garlic
turns golden, remove the garlic with a
skimmer, and throw it away. When the oil
reaches 375~ F. on a deep-fat thermometer,
stir the batter to distribute the corn evenly
and in the skillet fry rounded tablespoons
of the batter, about 6 at a time, for 2 to
2~~~ minutes on each side, or until the fritters
are golden.
5. Transfer the fritters as they are cooked to
paper towels to drain and try not to eat them
all right then and there in the kitchen.
Makes about 20 fritters.

  Some people like these fritters with ap-
plesauce, as in potato pancakes. Some like
them with maple syrup. But I like mine with
salsa on the side.
  This is a summer dish, and this salsa can
only be made in the summer. You need a
few big ripe tomatoes, one brand-new on-
ion, one sweet green pepper, and a chili as
hot as you can stand. Dice everything up
(wearing rubber gloves for the chili) and
dress the salsa with olive oil, celery salt,
lime juice, and minced garlic. Children
probably won't like this, but grown-ups
will. Salsa or no salsa, one bite of these frit-
ters will have your friends telling you about
their days at summer camp when they lined
up at the kitchen hatchway begging the
cook for a few more.
  That is the magic of corn, America's
most emblematic food. It evokes memories
of sunburn and swimming in the lake and
wandering on the beach looking for shells.
Corn on the cob is true soul food and re-
quires of the exhausted cook nothing more
than a large pot of boiling water and a few
people willing to do the shucking. Further-
more, it provides entertainment for small
children who find corn silk irresistible.
  If you still have corn left over, fate has
called out to you that you must make corn
relish. I would not even try to resist this
call. I have made corn relish inspired by the
recipe in Helen Witty's irreplaceable, in-
valuable, and all-around excellent book
Fancy Pantry. As a result-~I am not
ashamed to reveal-~my corn relish won a
blue ribbon at the agricultural fair in West
Cornwall.

	BLUE RIBBON
     SWEET CORN RELISH

1. Combine in a large pan (I use a preserv-
ing pan): 6 cups uncooked fresh corn (cut
from about 12 ears), 1 large red pepper,
diced, 1 green pepper, diced, about ~~~ to 1
cup firmly packed dark brown sugar (de-


pending on how sweet you like it), 2 table-
spoons coarse salt, 2 tablespoons English-
style dry mustard, 1~~~ teaspoons ground
celery seed (or use celery salt and cut the
amount of salt accordingly), ~~~ teaspoon
cayenne (or use fresh hot chilies to taste),
and 1~~~ cups cider vinegar. (Corn relish,
like chutney, is friendly and hard to mess
up. If you don't have dry mustard, use some-
thing else: turmeric, garam masala, or curry
powder. Taste is the deciding factor.)
2. Bring this mixture to a boil over medium
high heat, stirring from time to time, then
lower to a simmer. When the mixture be-
gins to cook down (which should take about
25 minutes), add 2 cups chopped onion.
Cook the mixture for only a few minutes
more so that the onions stay crunchy.
3. Ladle the relish into about six ~~~-pint
sterilized Mason-type jars (see below for
GOURMET's sterilizing procedure) and seal
the jars. Put the jars in a water bath canner
or on a rack set in a deep kettle, add enough
hot water to the canner or kettle to cover the
jars by 2 inches, and bring it to a boil. Pro-
cess the jars, covered, for 10 minutes,
transfer them with tongs to a rack, and let
them cool completely. Store the jars in a
cool dark place.

  You may never have to buy Christmas
presents again. Your friends will be de-
lighted (or puzzled, but ultimately delight-
ed) by your gift. Many people are not
familiar with corn relish, and it is up to you
to enlighten them.
  And even when everyone is tired of corn
on the cob, you will never have to pass a
sign marked Fresh Corn without stopping
for an armload or two.

TO STERILIZE JARS AND GLASSES
FOR PICKLING AND PRESERVING ~

  Wash the jars in hot suds and rinse them
in scalding water. Put the jars in a kettle and
cover them with hot water. Bring the water
to a boil, covered, and boil the jars for 15
minutes from the time that steam emerges
from the kettle. Turn off the heat and the let
the jars stand in the hot water. Just before
they are to be filled invert the jars onto a
kitchen towel to dry. (The jars should be
filled while they are still hot.) Sterilize the
jar lids for 5 minutes, or according to the
manufacturer's instructions.~

  This column is one of a series of articles
that Laurie Colwin sent to us before her un-
timely death in October, 1992. The articles
will run throughout the year.


  Years ago, in a group-therapy
  session, I heard a story that I
  have never forgotten. It en-
lightened me to how a Higher Power
works in our lives. It went like this:
  "Hey, Father," said a man talking
to a priest. "You got it all wrong about
this God stuff. He doesn't exist. I
oughta know."
  "Why's that, my son?"
  "Well, when I was ice-fishing in
the Arctic far from the nearest village,
a blizzard blew up with wind and
blinding snow. I was a goner. So I got
down on my knees and prayed real
hard, begging God for help."
  "And did He help you?"
  "Heck no. God didn't lift a finger.
Some Eskimo appeared out of no-
where and showed me the way."
  It took me a while to recognize the
Eskimos in my life. And I had needed
them so desperately.
  I grew up haunted by my maternal
grandfather, John B. Watson, a fa-
mous psychologist who founded a
movement called behaviorism. It
taught parents to resist their chil-


dren's natural bonding needs, which
he considered undesirable. There
was to be no cuddling, no kissing, few
outward signs of affection. As a result
of this kind of treatment as a child,
my mother later learned to use alco-
hol to numb her feelings of isolation.
And my father, a high-powered ad-
vertising executive, also succumbed
to alcohol. Despite their affliction,
they loved me deeply. I grew up with
my younger brother in affluent Wes-
ton, Connecticut, where I discovered
my calling. At 11 I joined the Silver
Nutmeg Theatre Company with roles
in plays like Alice in Wonderland and
Little Women in elementary schools
around the state.
  Smitten by the theater, I met one
of my first Eskimos, Eva Le Galli-
enne, the legendary actress, who was
teaching at the White Barn Theatre
nearby. Miss Le G. was a small, de-
lightful woman with a tiny nose, vio-
let eyes and translucent skin. She
wore lavender cashmere sweaters
and periwinkle-blue dresses. A loving,
giving person, she taught youngsters


like me as well as professionals. I
learned so much from her-~how to
feel and project emotions, and to let
"the sacred fire strike" by eliminating
self so that the character one is play-
ing shines through.
  Miss Le G. also inspired me spiri-
tually. Though Mom and Dad were
not religious, I was attracted to
church. Sunday mornings I'd hop on
my bicycle and pedal to the Norfield
Congregational Church, where I sang
solos in the choir. My early days in a
dysfunctional family were traumatic,
to be sure, but it was in church that I
was reminded of hope and goodness.
  The power and abundance of that
hope became very clear to me one
beautiful summer afternoon when I
was 16 and just back from a rehearsal
at a nearby Shakespeare festival. I
was walking in a field, and as I
stopped by a tree I suddenly had an


being used by some greater Power
and try to obey it."
  It was my belief in a spiritual life
that sustained me through the diffi-
cult years to come. As a teenager I
suffered a short-lived marriage to an
older man who beat me mercilessly.
Later I was offered a leading role in
the film Come Fly With Me, but a doc-
tor misdiagnosed my hepatitis. With-
out proper treatment, I got too sick to
take the role.
  Then, most devastating of all, was
my father's suicide. It happened after
Dad, tormented by alcohol, had lost
job after job and succumbed to hope-
lessness. Mother and I were eating
lunch when a gunshot rang out from
the bedroom. We dashed in to find he
had shot himself in the head. For a
year I kept hearing that gunshot and
was barely able to work at all.
  Finally, after fighting my own al-

V~I~T~A~L  S~I~G~N~S

fleas. On this day, all 7,500 of them are
happily standing upside down biting
through a plastic membrane to suck up
the cow's blood on the other side. One
Artificial Dog produces 12,000 fleas a
day, doing work that formerly employed
about 25 real dogs and cats.
  This morning, Georgi is gathering eggs.
He does it by removing the pens from the
dog, then opening each one over a funnel-
shaped "flea separator." The adult fleas
hop out and fall into the funnel, where the
vacuum's suction pins them against a
screen "in a high wind," as Georgi puts it.
The eggs stay behind.
  I comment on how this miracle system
lets no fleas escape when, sure enough,
one gets away. We both dive to the floor to
grab him, but the flea fakes left and goes
right, then right again and disappears.
  "If you don't get them by the second
hop, you usually don't get them," Georgi
says. We don't.
  But never mind. Right now, some
800,000 of its kin are stowed safely in
Ziploc bags in Georgi's freezer, ready for
sale. The question is, Who wants them?
  Mostly it's big drug companies and
chemical labs trying to help me-~the lady
with two cats, four dogs, and Oriental
rugs that come to life each summer as
Ctenocephalides felis, the common flea,
takes over my home.
  And helping they are. By making an
extract from Georgi's livestock, Greer
Laboratories, Inc., in Lenoir, North Car-
olina, can now offer allergists and veteri-
narians antigen tests to tell whether you
or your dog or cat are itching because of
fleas or something else.
  Even better, during the past few years
companies have come up with a genuine
flea-relief breakthrough: new age com-
pounds called insect growth regulators.
  It's about time that something did the
trick. Professional exterminators say fleas
come right after cockroaches and termites
as the nation's most troublesome pests.
Consider that 110 million dogs and cats
are scattered among the nation's 94 mil-
lion households. And that fleas can be
debilitating to young animals and tor-
turous to those with allergies. In regions
of high humidity, flea allergy dermatitis is
the number one complaint at the vet's.
Americans spend a million dollars a day
fighting fleas at home and almost three
times that much-~$1 billion each year-~if
you figure in vet bills and exterminators.
  "Oh well, `A reasonable amount of
fleas is good for a dog,'" says Georgi,
quoting homespun philosopher David


How to Hurt a Flea


got them.


STOP THEM FROM


BREEDING IN YOUR HOME

Use an insect growth regulator. Look for
products containing either methoprene or
fenoxycarb, sold as do-it-yourself sprays.
Used properly, they're risk-free for you
and your animals but death to flea eggs
and larvae. "Foggers" with these growth
regulators are also good but tricky to use.
They mostly spread tiny droplets that fall
straight down and won't drift under sofas
or around corners. No matter what you
use, wash the pet on the same day.
Vacuum, vacuum, vacuum. You'll not only
suck up lots of flea eggs, you'll starve any
lingering larvae. Use the powered, rotat-
ing "beater brush" attachment on your
vacuum. Then take that pointy crevice
tool and get tough with the couch and
baseboards. Repeat early and often.
Wash your pet's bedding once a week with
detergent. Dry on high heat. Flea pupae
die at temperatures above 95~F and at
humidities below 50 percent. If your pet
doesn't have bedding, give him some.
You could even put a towel down in the
car or under a favorite napping bush.
Consider flea-killing dusts. If you can stand
the mess, diatomaceous earth supposedly
dehydrates fleas and their larvae when you
sprinkle it on your pet's bedding. It's hard
to find, though (check pet shops), and all
flea experts aren't convinced it helps.
  Borate powder (a.k.a. boric acid or borax)
is tougher on fleas, but you have to spread
the stuff on your furniture and carpets and
then make a point of not cleaning it up.

FOR NOVICE DECK BUILDERS.


By JOSEPH TRUINI


      ~isten carefully and
      you'll hear the sounds
      of summer echoing
across your neighborhood. They're
the sounds of hammers ringing and
saws singing as homeowners build
backyard decks.
  Wooden decks represent the sin-
gle most popular, do-it-yourself
home improvement project. There's
no mystery to why decks are so pop-
ular: They're easy to build, afford-
able and an economical way to gain
valuable outdoor living space. And,
decks hold their resale value.
According to a survey conducted by
Remodeling, a trade magazine for re-
modeling contractors, you can ex-
pect to recoup nearly 84 percent of a
deck's cost when you sell your home.
  Here are five distinct decks that 
range from a modest platform to an
elegant, multi-level structure. And
only basic carpentry skills are re-
quired to build them.


ra-cotta border tiles. If your home al-
ready has a concrete patio, you can
simply lay tile directly over it using
thin-set mortar. If the patio is too
small, enlarge it by excavating, forming
and pouring a concrete extension.
  Redwood was chosen for this pro-
ject because of its natural beauty, di-
mensional stability and resistance to rot
and insect infestation. (Note that this is
true only of the heartwood grades of
redwood cut from the center of the log.
The sapwood grades offer less resis-
tance.) The understructure frame of
the sun deck was built of 2~8 redwood
joists spaced 24 in. on-center. The left-
hand end of the deck (closest to the
house) rests on the concrete patio and
is nailed to a pressure-treated 2~4 cleat.
The cleat is fastened to the patio with
lead expansion shields and ~~~-in.-dia. ~
3-in. lag screws.
  The 2~6 redwood decking was 
nailed to the joists with galvanized
common nails. Redwood is soft and 
easy to nail, but be sure to pre-drill
pilot holes at the boards' ends to pre-
vent splitting.
  On the landing, at the base of the
stairs, is a cozy redwood bench con-
structed of 4~4s and 2~6s. Above the
bench is a modest shade arbor featuring
an overhead lattice made of 2~2s. Each
of the steps in the stairway leading to
the balcony deck is made of seven red-
wood 2~4s. The 2~4s were bolted to-
gether to form massive 3~~~-in.-thick ~
10~~~-in.-deep steps.
  The balcony deck is built off the
upstairs master bedroom and offers a
private perch for enjoying the Sunday
morning paper. The deck is enclosed
with a railing made of 4~4 posts, 2~4
rails and a 2~6 cap. Note that the 2~4
rails were installed horizontally to cre-
ate fewer obstructions and offer a bet-
ter view than would have vertical
balusters.

we are as good as the best-~there is not a single plant at
Chelsea that you don't find at Courson. And I am happy to
say that the quality chez nous is sometimes even better."
  The diversity Fustier refers to embraces perennials, shrubs,
trees, threatening-looking carnivorous plants, aquatics in pools
dug specially for the show, alpines, impossibly bosomy hy-
drangeas, bougainvilleas and daturas from the C~~te d'Azur,
and stylish bamboos from the old pottery town of Anduze in
the Cevennes mountains. Although foreign purveyors are wel-
come and do participate (including, as a matter of fact, some
from England), most of the nursery people are French. No one
doubts the assumption that they are the country's best.
  Staged in a corner of the 86-acre park at Courson, the event
also includes booths filled with hand-blown hurricane lamps
and teak tables to sit them on; gently worn, irresistibly nostal-
gic antiques like watering cans and wheelbarrows; pottery; stat-
uary; paving tiles; potpourri; state-of-the-art tools; botanical
watercolors (artists are present and pleased to meet you); prac-
tical accessories like gloves, leaf bags, aprons and straw hats.
  With its friendly boutique atmosphere and naturalistic set-
ting under the famous cloud-strewn skies of the ~~le-de-France,
Courson is for connoisseurs and neophytes alike. Last May,
20,000 people turned up to shop at the stands of 150 ex-
hibitors. (The same month 750 stand-holders at Chelsea at-
tracted 180,000 visitors.) When Roy Strong, the English
author of garden-design books, attended in 1992, he wrote
that Courson had "a delectable, fresh, amateur pell-mell air
about it. What it lacked in finish it more than made up for in
joie de vivre." This year garden writer Robin Lane Fox ad-
monished his fellow Brits for all their unkind jokes at the ex-
pense of the French, and urged them to go. "The show has a
wonderful feel of informality and weekend market which has
still not been lost to its huge success," he noted.
  H~~l~~ne Fustier does not discount the glamorous high-society
patronage of such gardeners as Princess Greta Sturdza, whose
Le Vasterival in Normandy is famous for its azaleas and rhodo-
dendrons. Nor does Fustier take for granted the attention
shown by landscape architect Pascal Cribier, one of a team
working on the Tuileries gardens in Paris, and American garden
designer Madison Cox, the author of Artists' Gardens (Abrams,
November 1993). And yet what interests Fustier most is the
nurturing of what she calls "a new public." Gardening has taken
on an importance that was unthinkable in France even ten years
ago. The French are interested in plants, but are not always
knowledgeable. At Courson, they ask ingenuous questions like,
"Will it be hard to grow?" "Is it pretty when it flowers?" Ex-
hibitors are unusually willing to share their expertise.
  What's in it for the American gardener? The jump on new
Continental trends and a cash-and-carry policy that will prob-
ably find you clutching a half-dozen nascent clematis for the
plane ride home. (Note: U.S. Customs allows seeds and


certain bulbs into the country, but a special permit is required
from the Department of Agriculture for plants and shrubs.)
Chelsea has traditionally frustrated attendees, not just with its
hurly-burly atmosphere, but with its iron refusal to allow sell-
ing until the final day. At Courson, selling begins on the af-
ternoon of day one, but stands also have fixed displays,
ensuring that there is something for visitors to look at until the
show's last moments.
  Tom Cooper, editor of Horticulture magazine, thinks highly
enough of Courson to have brought over a group of Ameri-
cans in May 1993. The group saw signs of what Patrice Fustier
identifies as the new "back-to-natural" movement. "Whereas
in recent years in France the trend has been toward formal,
rectilinear gardens, now it is loose and supple," he observes.
"As a reaction to the mode for pale and tender colors there is a
whole palette of strong yellows that evokes the Italian Riviera
of the twenties and thirties. And Gilles Clement, who recently
designed the Parc Citro~~n along the Seine in Paris, is talking a
lot about black flowers like dark iris and violas."
  Fustier says fashions in gardening are so international now
that if a plant pleases the French there is every reason to be-
lieve it will please not only Americans, but the Germans and
the Dutch as well. "A newly introduced peony with good color
that does well in both sun and shade, that is easy to grow-~
the professional will want to buy it at Courson, and the ama-
teur will want to order it at home," he says.
  Many attendees with long experience of Courson make the
P~~pini~~re et Paysages a first stop. This nursery from the Rh~~ne
Alps offers more than fifty species of magnolias, as well as a
catalog of endangered fruits. P~~pini~~re de Coudray from
Haute-Normandie is famous for its shade- and peat-loving
plants, Asiatic primulas, gentians, meconopsis and lilies.
Despalles, of Paris, specializes in hostas, orchids and bulbs.
  The Fustiers knew little about gardening before launching
Courson. The show has its roots in the 1976 drought that left
many of the ch~~teau's celebrated rhododendrons almost dead.
The drought triggered the rehabilitation of the park and the
interest of a botanical society wanting to visit. One of the
group's members, a nurseryman, asked if he could try selling
plants, and the Fustiers agreed. If people buy plants that thrive,
H~~l~~ne said to herself, they will return the next season, and
the next and the next. That, of course, was eleven years ago.
She was absolutely right. ~

  "In the realm of decoration I am only interested in what is strictly necessary, what is ab-
solutely essential," announces De Padova, who was born in the mountains around Lake Como
in the Lombardy region of northern Italy. "Nothing counts more for me than simplicity. Along
with space it is one of today's great privileges. My furniture is for rigorous people with a taste for
minimalism. They dress simply-~in Ralph Lauren or Giorgio Armani rather than Gianni Ver-
sace. I would even say they eat simply. And certainly when it comes to furnishing their homes,
they want to do that simply too. You know, less is more."  
  The core of De Padova's collection is designed by Vico Magistretti, the 73-year-old Mi-
lanese former architect and town planner. He is known for the molded fiberglass Selene chair
he created in 1968 for Artemide, the company that would later provide seed money for Et-
tore Sottsass's seriously crazy Memphis group. Magistretti's furniture for De Padova, such
as his elegantly anonymous Tani Moto cubbyhole bookcases in beechwood, reflects their
shared credo that nothing should be sacrificed to organization, and that what works domes-
tically should also succeed in the workplace. His coolly restrained Shine table-~a chamfered
oval laminate top on splayed legs in a satin-finish aluminum and steel alloy-~is meant as

EDUCATION


Black Male College Athletes
Receive Fewer Degrees
  A recent NCAA study has de-
termined that Black male athletes
have the lowest graduation rate
of any group in Division I athlet-
ics.
  The study determined that both
White, non-athlete male students
and White male athletes graduat-
ed at a 55 percent rate. But Black
athletes, both male and female,
had only a 36 percent graduation
rate when attending a Division I
school, the highest level of athlet-
ic competition.
  When broken down by gender,
Black females graduated at a 44
percent rate, while Black males
graduated 34 percent of the time.

comparison, less than 10% of the deaths
among people age 40 and older are
traffic fatalities. Yet a common mistake
that families make is to assign the small-
est, lightest car to the youngest driver.
  Based on weight alone, a 3,300-
pound Oldsmobile Eighty-Eight
Royale, for example, can be expected to
provide better protection in a crash
than a 2,300-pound Geo Storm.
  What about putting young drivers in
sport-utility vehicles or vans, which of-
ten top 4,000 pounds? It's probably not
a good idea-~not because the vehicles
are inherently dangerous but because
inexperienced drivers may not exercise
the proper precautions for handling
such large cars. Some minivans and
utility vehicles score well in the IIHS in-
jury reports primarily because they are
often driven by adults transporting
small children.
  Large cars also provide the best side-
impact protection because they have
more surface area over which to dis-
perse crash forces. Four-door sedans
typically provide better protection than


impact, prevents the driver's head from
hitting the steering wheel. A passenger
bag, while desirable, is not as critical.
"You always hit the steering wheel
when you're a driver but you don't usu-
ally hit the dashboard if you're a pas-
senger," says Kennerly Digges, who
teaches automotive safety at George
Washington University. "A passenger-
side air bag is nice to have, but it's not
as important as a driver's air bag." By
1998 all new cars will have both driver's
and passenger's air bags. All new light
trucks will have both bags by 1999.
  Padding is a less obvious but no less
important safety feature. The 1994 In-
finiti Q45, for example, has a thickly
padded dashboard and head liner, plus
padding above the doors, on the doors
and on the door posts. Even the sun vi-
sors are padded and locked into place.
Some manufacturers have cut the num-
ber of dials and knobs sticking out of
the dashboard. The Saab 900S has a
flattened dash, which makes the car
roomier and reduces the chance of in-
jury. The Buick Park Avenue Ultra has

Vitamins with clout
Vitamins, organic substances that are es-
sential for normal metabolism and
growth, help regulate protective chemical
reactions in the body. Scientists have long
known that these compounds prevent de-
ficiency diseases such as scurvy, rickets,
beriberi, pellagra and night blindness,
which are virtually unknown in the U.S.
today because of improved diet and forti-
fied foods. But over the years, a variety of
nutrients have been touted by health au-
thorities and vitamin faddists alike to
have quasi-miraculous powers against
other ailments. The most popular asser-
tions are that vitamin C quashes colds; vi-


tamin B6 allays the symptoms of PMS; and
vitamin E counters infertility in women.
  Though studies failed to prove such
claims definitively, health-conscious
Americans boosted supplement sales to
$3 billion in 1990, more than doubling
revenues since 1976. And now, it turns out,
the boomers' faith in vitamins as vanguards
of preventive medicine may be justified.
  Consider some recent studies:
The antioxidant compounds Vitamins C
and E and beta carotene (a compound,
plentiful in dark-green and orange
vegetables, that the body can convert into
vitamin A) have been shown to provide the
most pronounced benefits by counteracting
unstable molecule particles called free radi-
cals. These chemicals, which are produced
by the body and also formed in the envi-
ronment, can damage cells and promote
heart disease, cancer and other disorders.
  Antioxidants may help prevent heart
disease-~the nation's leading killer-~by
inhibiting LDL (low-density lipoprotein,
or "bad" cholesterol) from oxidizing
and forming fatty deposits on artery


walls, notes Ishwarlal Jialal, M.D.,
co-director of the Lipid Clinic at the
University of Texas Southwestern Medi-
cal Center, in Dallas.
  In an ongoing Harvard Medical School
study, male doctors with heart conditions
who took 50 mg of beta carotene every
other day had fewer heart attacks, strokes,
and deaths related to heart disease than
those who did not. Charles Hennekens,
M.D., professor of preventive medicine at
Harvard Medical School, found, too, that
elderly people who ate vegetables high in
beta carotene had a lower risk of dying
from heart disease and that women who
consumed beta carotene- and vitamin
E-rich diets (and/or took supplements of
these nutrients) had 22 percent fewer car-
diovascular problems.
  According to Gladys Block, Ph.D., an
epidemiologist at the University of
California at Berkeley, a summary of more
than ninety studies suggests that high vi-
tamin C intake significantly reduces the
risk of cancers of the oral cavity, esopha-
gus, stomach and cervix.	(continued)

On October 1, 1958, when Pvt.
Elvis Aron Presley arrived at the
U.S. Army base in Friedberg, Ger-
many, he was 23 years old, an innocent
abroad, trim, charming, drop-dead hand-
some and the most famous young man on
earth. Elvis served 17 months over there,
attained the rank of sergeant-~and cap-
tured the hearts of his German hosts. Says
Andreas Schr~~~er, "The fascinating thing is
how so many people here still love him."
  Schr~~~er, 28, owns one of the largest
collections of Elvis memorabilia in the
world. A native of Gelsenkirchen, near
Cologne, he was only 10 when he started
collecting Elvis records. In the years since,
with the help of two friends, he has
acquired everything from Elvis T-shirts
and teddy bears to Elvis's very own Jail-
house Rock movie script and an electric
razor Daddy Vernon bought him. In a new
book, Private Presley, Schr~~~er has assem-
bled 231 previously unpublished pho-
tographs of the King, plus many others
that have appeared only in German and
other European newspapers and maga-
zines from that period. Here are the best
of them. Please, don't get all shook up.


After someone swiped her Saab from a New York City
street, Anne Howard scanned the classified ads for something
good, cheap and used to replace it. Three days later, she bought a
1982 Volkswagen Rabbit. "It had a little rust," she recalls, "and the
engine didn't sound terrific, but it was cheap and drivable." For a few
hours, at least. The morning after registering her car, Howard set
out on a 200-mile drive. When she stopped for coffee, the Rabbit
stopped for good. And she was hundreds of dollars in the hole.
  The thought of buying yet another car filled her with dread. She's
not alone. Recent research by auto-industry consultant J.D. Power
and Associates shows that women prefer having their teeth drilled
to shopping for a car.
  It doesn't have to be that way. Buying a used car is always a
gamble, but knowing the rules of the game can help stack the
odds in your favor. Rule one: Take time to shop around. Rule two:


you're shopping new- or used-car lots, look for well-established
dealers with reputations to protect.
  But before you hit the streets, do some homework. Check your
local library for Consumer Reports magazine's latest April issue,
devoted completely to cars. Its "frequency of repair" data on various
makes and models can steer you clear of clunkers. To determine
the fair market value of a car, check the National Automobile Deal-
ers Association (NADA) Official Used Car Guide, also known as "the
blue book," available in the reference section of most libraries and in
some banks. Some affiliate clubs of the American Automobile Asso-
ciation will also quote members the price over the phone.
  Once you've narrowed down your options, choose a clear day and
close friend for your car hunt. You'll need both to look for nicks and
listen for knocks. Some red lights to watch for:
ELECTRICAL BREAKDOWN Test all the switches by having your friend
stand outside to confirm that signals and lights are working proper-
ly. Electrical problems can mean costly repair work.
HOLES IN THE DASHBOARD These could be a sign you're in an old cab or
police car that had equipment mounted on the dash. (Bullet holes
are another telltale sign.) A tough past may preclude a long future.
RAMPANT RUST Wheel wells, rocker panels (under doors) and door
edges are most vulnerable to damage. Look for flaking paint, often a
sign of underlying rust. A little shouldn't concern you, but if rust has
eaten through the trunk or interior floor, lethal fumes can enter the car.
BLUE SMOKE Take the car out for a test drive, get it up to highway
speed, then take your foot off the accelerator for a few seconds. If
you spot blue smoke billowing from the exhaust, the car is burning
oil. Major engine repairs ahead.
BENT BODY Drive through a puddle, then check the tire tracks left by 
the wet wheels (or ask a friend to watch from behind). The rear tires
should directly follow the tracks of the front tires. If they don't, the
body or frame has been bent. Don't buy it.
LYING MILES It's illegal to tamper with odometers. Even so, it's esti-
mated that mileage counters are rolled back on more than half of 
the used cars sold every year. There's no surefire way to spot


tampering, but a few things should raise suspi-

  CFP: Certified Financial Planner. Financial planner who must meet
education, examination, experience and ethics requirements established
by the International Board of Standards and Practices for Certified
Financial Planners. IBCFP's aim is to protect the public by helping finan-
cial planners gain the credibility of other professionals, such as accoun-
tants, by making certain those who earn the CFP designation are well
qualified.
  PFS: Personal Financial Specialist. Designation the American Insti-
tute of Certified Public Accountants gives to accountants who have
passed an examination and have at least three years' experience in per-

charge of wire fraud-~asked in-
vestors to send their checks to her
own account at the Reserve Fund in
New York, according to Martha
Roush, her probation officer. She then
wired the money back to her bank in
Berkeley. "These people just never
knew there were no such things as
CDs backed by the Federal Reserve,"
says Roush. "Moreover, most of her
victims ignored their instincts. For
example, maybe a check was late, but
then it arrived with an explanation of
sorts and they were so glad to get it
they accepted the excuse. Others were
shocked, exclaiming, `She was so
believable; she steered me right in
times past.'"

~ Don't do business with anyone
who won't tell you exactly how
and how much he/she is paid.
  Think about whether you want to
pay for the planner's services with a
flat fee or a combination of fee and
commission. Some planners receive


only fees for their services. These
"fee-only" planners are arguably the
most objective: They will earn the
same amount of money no matter
which product you buy.
  "When you hire a fee-only planner,
he or she is a fiduciary to you and
you stand on much firmer ground if
something goes wrong," says Hoog-
stra. "When you pay a commission
you have to understand that the plan-
ner works for the people who pay the
commission and that you're purchas-
ing a product. In the eyes of the law
you're an equal. It's very much a case
of caveat emptor."
  Some planners charge a fee for
their services but offset the fee with
commissions. In other words, if your
financial-planning bill is $2,500 and
the planner earns a $500 commission
on mutual funds he sells you, you
would pay only $2,000. These are
"fee-offset" or "fee-based" planners.
Many fine planners use this system,
but it does make it a little more diffi-


cult for you to be sure you're getting
unbiased advice at a fair cost.
  The National Association of Per-
sonal Financial Advisors (NAPFA) is
made up of fee-only planners. Still,
this does not necessarily mean it is
the best place to go for one. NAPFA
does not require its members to
undergo any type of testing or certi-
fication, although they must meet
some education requirements and
have at least three years of experi-
ence. Says Evensky: "I would never
use NAPFA membership as the sole
standard for competence."
  Be especially wary of stockbrokers
and insurance salespeople who call
themselves financial consultants.
They have a vested interest in selling
stocks or insurance for which they
collect a commission.
  Says AARP's Hoogstra: "You need
to say, I must know the ongoing cost
of working with you. Otherwise I'll
go elsewhere."

~ Put together a list of eight to ten
planners in your area who have
specialized training.
  You will probably want to include
someone with the CFP designation.
But that alone is not enough. Start
with these sources: your accountant,
attorney, The Institute of Certified
Financial Planners (800-282-PLAN),
the International Association for
Financial Planning (800-945-IAFP),
and the American Institute of Certi-
fied Public Accountants (800-TOA-
ICPA). Ask the latter for names in
your area of certified public accoun-
tants with the personal financial spe-
cialist (PFS) designation.
  The PFS designation is a fairly
new one; only about 700 planners
have it, says Stuart Kessler, a partner
at Goldstein, Golub, Kessler & Co. in
New York City and chairman of 
AICPA's Personal Financial Planning
Executive Committee. According to
IBCFP, about 4,000 CPAs have the
CFP designation.

cycled" and "degradable"?


To evaluate environmental claims,
look for product labels with specific
information about the product or its
packaging. For example, if a label
says recycled, check how much of the
product or packaging is recycled.
  A growing number of labels on
recycled products tell where the recy-
cled material comes from. Post-Con-
sumer material comes from previous-
ly used business and consumer
products such as newspapers, plastic
bottles, glass containers and alu-
minum cans. Pre-Consumer material,
in contrast, is basically manufacturing
waste. For example, an envelope man-
ufacturer might take the clippings left
over when envelopes are cut from
paper and recycle them into other
paper products.
  Recyclable on the label means the
item can be collected and made into
useful products. This is relevant to
you, however, only if the material is
collected for recycling in your com-
munity. Contact your local recycling
office, trash-collection company or
scrap dealer for this information.
  Biodegradable materials like food
and leaves, when exposed to air,
moisture, and bacteria or other organ-
isms, break down and decompose into
elements found in nature. Pho-
todegradable materials, usually plas-
tics, disintegrate into smaller pieces
when exposed to enough sunlight.
  Either way, degradation of any


also slows decomposition.

IAN DAWSON


  The F1's user friendliness is evident within moments of
climbing in and swinging down those big, modified gull-
wing doors. With three aboard-~Palmer in the unique cen-
tral driving seat, your humble scribbler, and photo snapper
Ian Dawson in the identically reclined buckets just behind
and to either side of him-~there's none of that traditional
supercar claustrophobia. It's fairly tight on either side of
the passenger's arms and elbows, but driver movement is
uninhibited, head and leg room are generous for all, the
seats hug with reassuring lateral support, the view ahead
is panoramic, and yes, the driver really can see what's
happening directly behind or over his shoulder.
  Palmer engages first, second-~then sixth. This, a four-
miles-a-minute gear, pulls with civility from 15 mph. If
you're feeling lazy, that makes the useable rev range 7000
rpm. If you're not, keep the powerplant simmering above
3500 rpm, where it begins to get serious. At low to medium
revs, the BMW V-12 is inexplicably similar, hissing and
nasal, to Porsche's endearing flat-six, but from there on up,


its note becomes deep and sharp and bass-heavy with au-
thority, the turboprop whine passing into an urgent howl.
  When asked to make this transformation, the V-12 does
so immediately. No throttle lag before the mid-range, no
manic rush beyond it. Acceleration, though astonishing, is
fluid, progressive, and useable with accuracy. On the road,
this makes for speed with safety. On the twists of the
track, it keeps the car's line true and precise. Palmer turns
in toward the apex, holds the steering still, then balances
the car, exquisitely, with adjustments of the throttle. Slight
understeer on entry, the beginnings of a four-wheel-drift
at mid-point, darty little flicks of the steering wheel back
toward the straight-ahead position (but rarely beyond)
powering out. You'd only get the tail to wag on a dry road
through brutal inputs of power and steering in second or
third gears.
  Palmer smiles again: "Balancing the throttle in this car,
getting the whole thing to dance exactly as you want it to,
is child's play. You couldn't do this with a Bugatti, or
XJ220, or F40-~you just don't get that lovely progression,
that controllability, with a turbo engine."
  There's talk of dialing out some of the F1's initial under-
steer, but it would be fine-tuning. As Murray says: "We're
happy with the handling; it's very nearly sorted. The ride is
the one thing we've really got to work on; we're only about
75 percent of the way there. But we'll soon be going into
three months' intensive work on damping."
  The F1 is conspicuously firm and joggling at low road
speeds, but it's still a development mule. As McLaren Inter-
national boss Ron Dennis points out: "You're the first to
get anywhere near the car, because we wouldn't want to
expose it to customers yet. Being a prototype, it doesn't
represent the quality they'll get." Which means customers
can rest easy: Apart from its dynamic superiority, the pro-
totype's build quality and attention to detail, inside and out,
already put other supercars to shame.  -~Phillip Bingham


the same size as the OE tire is no prob-
lem. But many drivers looking for bet-
ter handling choose wider, lower-pro-
file tires. Here, it's easy to get into
trouble if you're not careful.
  On most cars, you can't use tires
more than an inch or two wider than
OE without clearance problems. As
Edmonds notes, "Some vehicles are
able to accept an extreme increase in
width, while others can accept very lit-
tle." Bob Devour, national sales man-
ager for Centerline Wheels, advises to
turn the front wheels to full lock in
both directions to see how much clear-
ance there is between the tire and
fenderwell, as well as any nearby sus-
pension components. Take measure-
ments, if you can. Also, check the clear-
ance between the wheel and brake
caliper. Knowing how much room 
you're working with will help you de-
termine how much wider the tires can
be without creating problems.
  Indiscriminately mounting either
wider or lower-profile tires can not on-
ly cause clearance problems, it can
make your car handle worse, changing
ground clearance and altering suspen-
sion geometry. If the tire diameter is
changed in the process, it can also
throw off calibrations for the
speedometer, anti-lock braking system,
and other computer-controlled systems
that sense vehicle speed or distance.
That's why for virtually all street ap-
plications, your new tires should be
about the same diameter as the origi-
nals. For those wanting to go with a
wider tire and lower profile (or shorter
sidewall) for improved handling and
response, the conversion needs to be
carefully planned.

Older Workers, Younger Bosses


To April Tripp, an older worker is anyone 40
or over. But then, she's only 25.
  As a manager at Enrich International, a
marketer of herbal and beauty products, in
Orem, Utah, Tripp supervises 30 people;
usually four or five are in the "older"
category. "It can be a little difficult when I
am the same age as [an employee's] youngest
child," she says.
  Any young supervisor could be mindful of
these observations about older workers:
  ~ Don't be afraid to hire them. "As long as
you treat them fairly with the other employ-
ees and don't show them any more or any less 
deference than you show anyone else, it can


be a real productive experience," Tripp says.
  ~ Regard older workers as a valuable
resource. They offer experience and special
qualities, says Joan Kelly of the American
Association of Retired Persons.
  ~ Don't be intimidated. Some older work-
ers think their age qualifies them for higher
pay, Tripp has found, but she's firm about not
favoring any age group with higher pay.
  ~ Deal with resentment tactfully. Some-
times an older worker resents a younger
boss. A tactic that has worked for Tripp is to
put the employee in charge of a special
project, which often makes the worker too
busy to be resentful.  -~Sharon Nelton

reverse when they get the lender's ap-
praised-value report.
  After the real-estate bubble burst in
the late 1980s, appraisers were accused of
overstating home values. "Now they may
be going too far in the other direction,"
says Paul Havemann, president of HSH,
of Butler, N.J., a publisher of mortgage-
based financial figures. He calls it the
"equity trap."
  If you get stuck in this trap, with an
appraisal that doesn't show enough equity
in your home to cover the amount of the
loan, there are things you can do.
  Douglas Brown, president-elect of the
Appraisal Institute, an association of pro-
fessional appraisers, notes that "the law
says the lender must give you a copy of
the appraisal if you ask for it." He adds,
"Make sure that they give you the full
report, not just the government-approved
cover page." You need all the extra notes
that show what the appraiser believes are
attractions and drawbacks.
  You also want to see which recent home
sales were used as "comparables" for your
home's value estimate. "It's quite possi-
ble," Brown says, "that a nearby home
sold for a higher price after the appraiser
worked on your report."
  Or the appraiser may not be sufficiently
familiar with your neighborhood and may
have misjudged "comparables" in an adja-
cent area of lower-quality homes.
  It's also possible that a home that was
used in the comparables column was a
"distress" sale. Someone may have lost a
job, or there may have been a divorce
requiring a quick transaction.
  Armed with new facts and figures, you
should call the appraiser and ask for an
appointment to go over the report, item
by item.
  The lender may increase the equity
figure for your home so you can qualify for
the loan. If the appraiser won't budge and
you feel you have been wronged, you can
ask the lender to send out another ap-
praiser to provide a second opinion.
  You'll have to pay another appraisal fee,
but if you get the loan at the interest rate
you want, it could be worth it.     ~~

AMAZING MAZES


   BUT EVEN BREEDING PROGRAMS attract the wrath of zoo crit-
   ics. "You cannot have a viable captive population without
   breeding a surplus," says Don Lindburg of San Diego.
   "The population is healthier genetically if it has many
   founders, each contributing only two or three offspring to
future generations. You often end up with animals that have met this
goal while they are still quite young but must be maintained until they
die many years later."
  What is to be done with these surplus animals? "You start euthan-
izing surplus orangutans or gorillas and your zoo is going to be shut
down in a week," says Lindburg.
  Some zoos sell their surplus animals to dealers, who sell them to 
other zoos and sometimes to hunting camps. Hunters pay to shoot
exotic species. Control of the animals' use after they are sold to dealers
is difficult, and criticism mounts.
  Naturalist George Schaller of the New York Zoological Society sug-
gests: "Zoos will have to use contraceptives more often." Many zoos
also perform vasectomies on animals.
  Breeding often requires moving animals about-~sometimes unset-
tling to them and to the public as well. When Timmy, a 33-year-old
silverback gorilla in the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo, was scheduled to
be moved to the Bronx Zoo to mate with females there, Timmy's fans
in Cleveland hit the roof. Animal-rights groups went to court, claim-
ing that it would be cruel to separate him from Kribi Kate, his female
companion.
  But Kribi Kate was barren. Moreover, zoo officials countered that
gorillas are not monogamous, and that in the wild a band's dominant

doing with their water.
  "If that doesn't work [Nat tempered his
words with a touch of irony], I remind them
about the Endangered Species Act, and that
some unique stocks of salmon are getting
wiped out in their streams, and that their
water use could get cut off. Usually then we
get on fine.
  "It's beginning to turn around," he said.
"The salmon counts are rising; the spawning
beds are improving. Things look promising,
even though we've still got those problems
with the big lumber companies."

  1 What is the role of chemistry in sex-
    ual desire?
Many people feel that love is the source
of sexual desire. For them, "chemistry"
only counts insofar as it helps create
love. But many of us have been wildly
attracted to someone we knew was com-
pletely ill-suited to us-~or to someone
we didn't even like.
  Chemistry is primal, in contrast to the
more rational thinking that goes into
choosing a mate. It can be traced, in part,
to pheromones, bodily secretions that 
provide a chemical form of communica-
tion between living things (pheromones
may be the reason women who spend a 
lot of time together often menstruate on
similar schedules). Things are going on

20 Questions


FINANCIAL


could use a financial structure. What
she probably doesn't need is a financial
planner. With typical minimum costs of
$2,000 for a comprehensive plan, most
planners are beyond the budgets and re-
quirements of those of us who earn
wages, pay bills, and don't have invest-
ment trust funds to look after.
  For someone like Marie, "a compre-
hensive financial plan might even be
overkill," suggests David Drucker, a Be-
thesda, Maryland-based financial plan-
ner. A better idea, he says: "Hire a
planner for a quick consultation and
pick his or her brain for an hour or two
just to get started."
  Marie, however, decided to take mat-

tined to become ice cream, pies and
cobblers, one should administer a
compassionate dose of honey, brown
sugar or bourbon. For delicacies like
the pur~~e of peaches that form the
basis of Italy's champagne cocktail,
the Bellini, a dash of sugar is in
order.
  I also came to understand that the
sweetness of a peach is a balancing
act between bitter and nectar, be-
tween the tickling fuzz, the delicacy
of the skin, the lushness of the pulp
and the danger of the pit.
  Though the peach was thought for
centuries to have originated in 
Persia, hence its botanical name,
Prunus persica, botanists are now
certain that as early as the fifth
century B.C., the peach was cultivat-
ed in China, where it is called Tao, a
symbol of life, immortality and
death.
  Beneath the sweet, giving flesh,
there is, inevitably, the pit. (That's
life!) A cyanide compound, it's what
gives the peach its almond tone,
what makes it a bittersweet conun-
drum.
  In the case of clingstone peaches,
the pit clutches the fruit in a most
unliberated fashion, and it is there-
fore better suited for industrial
canning than home cooking. Free-
stone peaches, on the other hand,
fall gratefully from their stones. If
purchased from a farm stand or
specialty producer, and allowed to
ripen at room temperature, they
are sublime eaten plain, served
with prosciutto or steeped in vin-
egar as a condiment for rich meats.
  Sight and smell are the most in-
fallible guides to buying peaches. In
other words, don't buy a peach that
doesn't smell like a peach, and don't
buy a hard, unyielding peach that
looks green beneath its bionic
blush.
  Once you have picked well, you are
then ready for one of life's peak
experiences, according to Brillat-Sa-
varin in "The Physiology of Taste."
The initial taste, he wrote, induces
the eater to continue, to chew his
juicy mouthful. But the peach does
not truly reveal its perfume until
fully swallowed. Only then, writes
the 19th-century philosopher, will
the taster stop and say to himself,
"How delicious."

Now, the Tables
Are Turning

Exports: U.S. firms face
dumping claims abroad

  THERE'S ONE CATEGORY IN WHICH U.S.
  companies lead the world: complaints
  about dumping. Since 1985, the govern-
ment has launched more than 320 probes
into charges that foreigners are hurting U.S.
industry by pricing their products too low.
When it decides they have, Washington
punishes the foreigners by laying on extra
duties, raising the U.S. prices of products
from Chinese sodium thiosulfate to New
Zealand kiwi fruit and Norwegian salmon.
But if Americans think that foreigners
aren't trading fairly, the feeling is recipro-
cated. In an increasing number of cases, it's
foreigners who complain about dumping-~
and U.S. exporters who are under attack.
Says Jan Woznowski of the General Agree-
ment on Tariffs and Trade: "This is clearly a
new tendency ... this trend will grow."
  Last week the trend hit U.S. steelmakers
broadside. On Tuesday, a federal ruling
found that parts of the U.S. industry had
been injured by cheap imports, clearing the
way for stiff anti-dumping duties on select-
ed steel products from 16 countries, includ-
ing Canada. But on Thursday, the U.S. in-
dustry's crusade against foreign unfairness
skidded to an embarrassed halt. A Canadi-
an tribunal declared that LTV, Worthing-
ton Steel and other U.S. companies are
dumping their steel north of the border.
That ruling will cost jobs in the depressed
Monongahela Valley near Pittsburgh: USX
Corp.'s Irvin Works faces an extra 19.6 per-
cent duty on every ton it ships to Canada.
  Ash act: Canada's is only the latest case
in which foreigners have turned the tables
by accusing U.S. business of trading unfair-
ly. India created an anti-dumping bureau-
cracy last year, and promptly assessed
$63.54 on each ton of American-made poly-
vinyl chloride, which is used to make plas-
tic films and pipes. 3M must pay an extra 20
percent anti-dumping duty on telephone
connectors in Mexico. Belgian chemical gi-
ant Solvay wants the European Community
to put anti-dumping duties on American
soda ash, a key ingredient in glass-~al-
though three big U.S. soda-ash producers
are owned by EC companies, one of them
by Solvay itself.
  Paradoxically, the spread of anti-dump-
ing actions is a result of the opening of
world trade. As countries like Colombia
and South Korea lower tariffs and eliminate
quotas, import licenses and other barriers,


local industries may be overwhelmed by
imports. Anti-dumping investigations can
be a convenient political tool, allowing a
government to demonstrate that it will pro-
tect businesses and workers from "unfair"
foreign competition. Although most econo-
mists consider dumping benign because it
lowers prices for consumers, governments
are more likely to judge that a high-profile
probe covering one industry will stave off
pressure to protect other industries. "It's a
good sign, not a bad sign, as it tends to mean
they're opening their markets," says Wash-
ington trade lawyer Terence Stewart.
  The political motives behind anti-dump-
ing laws are visible in Mexico, where small
businesses complain bitterly that high in-
terest rates and low import barriers have
left them unable to compete with goods
from Asia. To deflect the criticism, the gov-
ernment launched a sweeping inquiry in


April into whether China is dumping prod-
ucts like toys and clothes on the Mexican
market. While they investigate, Mexican
authorities are requiring Chinese shoe ex-
porters to pay a provisional duty of 1,105
percent-~11 times the value of the shoes.
  Beer spat: When U.S. exporters face
such complaints, they often contend that
foreign proceedings are slanted to protect
local firms-~precisely the complaint im-
porters voice about the American anti-
dumping law. G. Heileman Brewing Co.
was hit with duties after Canada found its
Seattle brewery to be dumping Rainier beer
in British Columbia. Is it possible to dump
in just one province? Canadian authorities
say it is. Washington wants GATT to over-
turn the ruling, arguing that Canada should
consider prices nationwide. While legal
proceedings continue, the higher prices
U.S. brewers must charge have decimated
their 10 percent share of the B.C. market.
Says Heileman general counsel Randy
Smith: "I don't think we have even 1 per-
cent right now."
  Congress, sensitive to business and labor
complaints about imports, has opposed ef-
forts to put new limits on anti-dumping
laws. But that tune may change now that
anti-dumping laws are costing jobs, not just
protecting them. Consider Monsanto. In 
1991, the European Community found it
guilty of dumping U.S.-made sweetener
and tacked on a duty of nearly $13 a pound.
"Our main competitor does not operate
with such a duty leveled against it," says
a company spokesman. Soon, Monsanto
won't, either. It will cut exports and open a
NutraSweet plant in France next month.

Fragile, Handel With Care


Music: An operatic rarity pops up in Santa Fe


of the libretto) moved the story from the
470 B.C. Persian court to an English country
house of Handel's time.
  Unfortunately, all that, including Thomas
Lynch's delightful set, was not enough to
ensure "Xerxes" a permanent spot in the
current Handel renaissance. For starters,
von Stade got sick and missed the first per-
formances (though she is expected back this
week, for the remainder of the run, which
ends on Aug. 25). Her replacement was
Katherine Ciesinski, who acted with just the
right arrogance but sang colorlessly. With
the exception of Asawa, who gave Arsa-
mene real bite, none of the cast sang in
absolute Handelian style. (Nonetheless,
Upshaw was superb.)
  The heart of the problem is the opera
itself, which is not to say it doesn't deserve a
hearing (second-drawer Handel is prefera-
ble to a lot of top-of-the-line pieces from
lesser mortals). In breaking out of his usual
mold-~a rigid structure comprising mainly
stand-up-and-sing numbers, many with or-
nate, lengthy repeats-~the composer cheat-
ed himself. There's a lot more "action"
and some comic moments to savor, but the
score doesn't begin to approach that of such
masterpieces as "Julius Caesar" and "Ario-
dante." Handel was, above all, a glorious
melodymaker. If he were alive, says Brit-
ish early-music specialist Trevor Pinnock,
"he'd probably have three hit musicals
playing simultaneously." (Thus sparing us,
perhaps, another Andrew Lloyd Weber
show.) At Santa Fe, "Xerxes" is engaging
theater. If the music comes up short-~well,
even when his melodic genius seems rela-
tively undernourished, Handel is welcome.

TROUT PARADISE FOUND!

nook) salmon and sea-run browns. On
the afternoon of our arrival, I was re-
trieving a small snail-imitative nymph
that I had cast for a nice brown trout,
when another fish swam beneath my
leader. I froze. "Good deer-stalker re-
action," whispered Marc. Then I
twitched the nymph. The trout ate it
and put on a show.
  A spectacular trip to Lake Man-
apouri in Fiordland with Marc Cohn
and Ham Swale (in whose home we
stayed) was the stuff of fantasy.
Though the lake offered fine fishing,
we headed for the Spey River, a main
feeder. There, the small pools were so
clear that water appearing knee-deep
would turn out to reach chest level.
Holes were a watercolor wash of pale
green. The Spey trout bordered on the
cavalier. For example, a rainbow Judy
had on snagged itself between two
rocks. Trying to free it, Marc was fi-
nally forced to move in with his prob-
ing net handle.
  "I can't believe it," he called. "I'm
poking all around, and this fish is just
sitting there looking at me." The trout
casually waited until the leader was
freed, then squirted away and broke
the roughened tippet.
  Pastured red deer graze a few casts
from Ham and Sue Swale's flower-
rimmed brick English-style home,
where the meals and accommodations
are perfection. In conversation one
night at dinner, Gillian confided that
her husband's thought processes were,
well, a bit unusual. I thought about the
boa constrictor. Then she mentioned
the huhu grub.
  The huhu (pronounced hoo-hoo) is
one of the giant longhorn beetles. Its
creamy, strong-jawed larvae can reach
2~~~ inches. The Maoris, the native
people of New Zealand, once deemed
it a delicacy tasting somewhat like
peanut butter. I did not sample it. Too
devastating a bait, it is now forbidden.
Local anglers asked Marc if he could
tie a huhu imitation. He needed a
model to work from. Soon a bag
seething with live huhus arrived.
  Marc was inspired (Gillian was not),
and he began exploring furniture up-


holstery for foam of the proper color.
The subsequent lure has a foam body, is
ribbed with monofilament and has a
yellow chenille head. Tackle shop pro-
prietor Thom Rivell of Cresco, Penn-
sylvania, reports that he took a U.S.
brown trout weighing more than eight
pounds, as well as river smallmouths, on
the thing.
  Although we were late for prime low
tide one night on the lower Aparima
near Riverton, resident and sea-run
browns still thrashed after tiny smelt.
Stumbling along the bank in the dark, I
chased sounds, bumped into something
and found my wife sitting on the beach.

  "What are you doing?" I asked.
  "Knitting," she said, showing me her
tangled leader and tippet. "You
knocked over my light."
  "Lovely leader," I said.
  "Well, I never fish in the dark," she
replied. Then we heard a roar. It was
Marc.
  The sounds were primal, first of
frustration over missed strikes, then of
triumph as he hooked a silvery sea
trout. We all admired it. Then the
trout stopped eating, and Marc flashed
a light on the water where I had been
fishing to reveal a gigantic eel. You re-
ally must fish with Marc.

turned to FoxPro. If your application was
in an unstable state, it's possible that data
loss could occur that could easily have
been avoided by doing a little cleanup be-
fore minimizing FoxPro.
  The way to accomplish this is by pro-
viding a button in the application that
minimizes all of FoxPro, but only after the
cleanup is done. You click on this button
instead of using the minimize arrow in the
upper-right-hand corner of the FoxPro
window. This function, which would be
used as your buttons VALID clause, was
suggested on FoxForum by Lou McDon-
ald. It takes advantage of the undocu-
mented Screen option of the Zoom Win-
dow command which minimizes the
FoxPro screen. He used the FoxPro Flush
command as our cleanup code; you could
add additional statements as needed.

  There's another way to accomplish
the same result, and I'll present it here
because it hints at the versatility of the
Keyboard command, which stuffs the
keyboard buffer:


function Iconize

  flush

  keyboard "{Alt-F} {leftarrow}n"

*end function Iconize

 
  This function works by opening up the
control menu in the FoxPro window and
then issuing the n command to cause the
window to minimize. You would nor-
mally open the control menu from the
keyboard by typing Alt-space, but since
you can't get this keystroke combination
through the Keyboard command, you in-
stead have to issue an Alt-F command,
which opens the FoxPro File menu. Then,
since the File menu is the first item, you
go left one position to open the control
menu.
  Admittedly this method is a kludge,
and it won't work when the system menu
isn't active or if an application has
changed the system menu so that the File
menu isn't first. But it shows how you can
get around some of FoxPro's limitations
by judicious use of the Keyboard com-
mand.
  MAYBE YES, MAYBE NO Despite its pow-
erful interface functions, FoxPro lacks an

night I was waiting in line outside a lo-
cal bar behind a pair of attractive fe-
males. (I must inform you before I go
any further that I have a tremendous
fetish for women's stockinged feet.) The
one who caught my eye was named
Penny. She was dressed as if she'd
been sent to me personally by the wet-
dream fairy.
  She was wearing a black vest that
tried to conceal her heaving breasts
and a black skirt that hugged her tight
butt. Then the part that started pump-
ing blood to my soldier of love-~she
had on black panty hose that had
seams going down her well-shaped
legs, ending at the top of her black
pumps, where the seam became a bow.
  I was directly behind Penny and her
friend and was able to listen in on their
conversation. Penny was complaining
about how much her shoes were hurt-
ing her feet. She also indicated this by
slipping her feet out of her shoes. I
thought my heart was pounding loud
enough for them to hear it. I've seen
this practice before, especially by fe-
males at a jewelry counter, where
they're often on their feet for hours. You
can't imagine how many times I've
played pocket pool while an unsus-
pecting female tried to relieve her tired
tootsies by slipping off her shoes.
  Back to the bar. Inside I lost track of
the girls for a while, but after an hour
or so, I spotted them leaning against a
railing. I quickly moved next to Penny,
who was, by this time, experiencing
some serious foot pain. I made small
talk, but tried at every opportunity to
turn the conversation to her exhausted
feet. I was getting some great looks at
her feet and knew that she had to be
mine when I saw that her toenail polish
matched her fingernails and lipstick-~
a subtle red.
  I told her that if she hadn't met her
dream man by 1:15, I'd be happy to
massage her feet-~something I did
many times for my ex. Our foot play
used to take place in the car, as well
as in restaurants.
  To my surprise Penny quickly agreed,
and at 1:15 she was walking toward me
with a pained expression. "I'm ready
for my foot rub." And I was ready for
some oxygen. I suggested we go
somewhere a little quieter-~her car.
Within minutes I had her sitting in the
driver's seat so I could freely massage
her tired feet on my lap.
  She moaned softly as I slipped off
her pumps. I methodically began rub-
bing every inch of her spectacular, silky-
sheer, black-stockinged feet. The swell
in my pants was very noticeable. Pretty
soon my cock was almost touching her
beautiful foot. As I stroked her left foot,
she brushed her right foot against my

  IT WAS THE PRINTED WORD, IN A SENSE,
  that brought Jim and Kate Lehrer
  together. When they first met, in
1959, he was a young reporter with
the Dallas Morning News, and she
had just arrived in town to start work
as a junior-high English teacher. As
Kate recalls, "I was moving into my
apartment house, and Jim [her new
neighbor] offered to carry my books
up the stairs." Nine months later, he
carried her across the threshold.
  Today, books continue to be the


ties that bind. In May, Jim, 59, and
Kate, 53, embarked on a nine-city
tour to promote his seventh novel,
Blue Hearts, a caper about an aging
spy, and her second, When They
Took Away the Man in the Moon, a
tender story of family life in Texas.
(Both have received glowing re-
views.) After a four-week hiatus, the
tour resumes this week for a five-city
jaunt that also will boost Jim's folksy
1992 memoir, A Bus of My Own,
coming out this month in paperback.

ton-based half of PBS's Emmy-win-

PLAYBOY: Might there be another Blues
Brothers movie?
AYKROYD: I'm working on a story with
John Landis, who directed the original.
We're going to try to bring back every-
body from the first movie. We have to
convince the studio. The walls of Univer-
sal are still stained from the first Blues
Brothers movie.
PLAYBOY: Stained? Didn't Universal
make money on that?
AYKROYD: Not really, because it cost so
much. They made their money back, but
it was traumatic getting the movie made.
It was an enormous production. John
was out of control.
PLAYBOY: You've often been criticized for
creating movies with runaway budgets.
AYKROYD: We are always criticized for
costs-~for 1941, Ghostbusters, Blues Broth-
ers-~but that money doesn't go into the
pockets of the actors and directors, it
goes into the pockets of labor.
PLAYBOY: And special effects and
wrecked cars....
AYKROYD: The major expense of Blues
Brothers was not the seventy police cars
we bought from the Chicago Police De-
partment. We paid only $700 each for
them. The major expense was labor, so
that's good, it gets people working, and
why shouldn't the profits of the mega-
corporations be reinvested in the trades
of this industry? If I write a big show and
it costs a lot of money, I make no apolo-
gies. I'd be a wealthier man today and a
better businessman if I sat down and
wrote small movies that cost little and
brought in lots.
PLAYBOY: Will you continue to make se-
quels-~whether based on the Blues
Brothers, Ghostbusters, Coneheads or
others?
AYKROYD: As long as there is something
new to do with them and it's enjoyable.
It's kind of nice to have built-in franchis-
es. The one I don't think we'll necessari-
ly further exploit is Ghostbusters. It looks

  with you whatever you do. I think I
  had to write all this down because
  your letter was such a shock to me,
  not a bad shock, more of a surprise.
  The idea had just never come into
  my head that the idea of raising a
  family would ever come into your
  head. So you can see, having never
  thought about it, it was a true sur-
  prise. No matter what happens I
  love you lots and it will be a real trip
  for both of us to see what I do with
  my life....

  Holly's letter forced me to admit that I
really didn't want to be a new daddy. Us
kids are a lifelong commitment. I realized
that I simply didn't want to make that
commitment. Orli and I loved each oth-
er, but we had different goals in life. De-
spite the bond between us, we would
have to go our separate ways.
  That summer I worked at Winnarain-
bow, a camp for the performing arts run
by Jahanarah and Wavy Gravy. I was the
comedy counselor. At the end of the sea-
son I made love with another counselor
on the outdoor trampoline. The next
morning I noticed a stain on the tram-
poline from my semen. I found a piece
of chalk and drew an outline around the
stain. It was, after all, the corpse of Hol-
ly's sibling.
  Holly had gone to visit a Greek island
and stayed there, working as a dishwash-
er and cleaning squid for a dollar an
hour, eight hours a day, seven days a
week. To take a bath she had to climb in-
to her kitchen sink. But now she was
back in London and planning to return
to America. She sent a photo taken in
one of those booths where she held up a
handwritten card with each of the four
poses, so that you could read this vertical
message in front of her smiling faces:
DEAR DAD SEND MONEY!


  Six years later Holly was the manager
of community and government relations
at KQED, the PBS and NPR affiliates in
San Francisco. I was performing in town
and staying at her apartment. One day,
because it was raining hard and she trav-
eled by motor scooter, I was tempted to
call her at work and tell her that if the
ground was too slippery to drive on, I'd
be glad to pay for a cab. But Holly was
now 27 (old enough to spank), and I re-
alized that if I were in Venice and it were
raining in San Francisco, I wouldn't
phone her. So now, even if she were to
die because her motor scooter slid in the
rain and I would have to live with that
horror for the rest of my life, I still had
to let go of my paternalism and trust her
judgment. I decided not to call. When
Holly came home, I told her how I had
resolved my dilemma.
  "Oh," she said casually, "if it had been
raining too hard, I would have taken a
bus home."
  Over dinner we were talking about the
way you realize how dependent you are
on appliances only when the electricity
goes off.
  "Speaking of appliances," she said,
"do you ever use that microwave oven
Mom and I gave you last Christmas?"
  "Yeah, once in a while, to heat up soup
and things. You know what, though, I
left the little door open and I found a
few mouse turds on the tray inside. If I
ever actually caught a mouse inside the
microwave, I'd try to shut the door be-
fore it could escape."
  "Dad, I can't believe you'd nuke a
mouse."
  "No, I'd never do that. I would just
unplug the microwave and carry it out-
side, and let the mouse go free."
  "And then you'd race it to see who
could get back to the house first."
  "And the mouse would win."


                  (continued from page 80)

in the storm. It came to me that Beauty,
too, must be somewhere in the middle of
those tamed hordes, and that fantasy
gave me new strength to wait.
  By lunchtime we knew we were ship-
wrecked. The lines were interminable
outside the seven restaurants, the cafete-
rias, the packed bars, and in less than
three hours they all had to be closed be-
cause there was nothing left to eat or
drink. The children, who at that mo-
ment seemed to be all the children in the
world, started to cry at the same time,
and a herd smell began to rise from the
crowd. It was a time for instinct. In all
that scrambling, the only things I could
find to eat were the last two cups of
vanilla ice cream in a children's shop.
While the waiter put the chairs on the ta-
bles as the patrons left, I ate very slowly
at the counter, seeing myself in the mir-
ror with the last little cardboard cup and
the last little cardboard spoon, thinking
about Beauty.
  The flight to New York, scheduled for
11 in the morning, left that night. By the
time I managed to board, the other first-
class passengers were already in their
seats and a flight attendant led me to
mine. My heart stopped. In the seat next
to mine, beside the window, Beauty was
taking possession of her space with the
mastery of an expert traveler. If I ever
wrote this, nobody would believe me, I
thought. And I  stammered an indecisive
greeting that she did not hear.
  She settled in as if she were going to
live there for many years, putting each
thing in its proper place and order until
her seat was arranged like the ideal
home where everything was within
reach. In the meantime, the steward
brought us the welcoming champagne. I
took a glass to offer to her but thought
better of it just in time. She wanted only
a glass of water, and she asked the stew-
ard, first in incomprehensible French
and then in an English only somewhat
more fluent, not to wake her for any rea-
son during the flight. Her warm, serious
voice was tinged with Oriental sadness.
  When the steward brought her the
water, she placed a toiletries case with
copper corners, like a grandmother's 
trunk, on her lap and took two golden
pills from a box that contained others of
various colors. She did everything in a
methodical, solemn way, as if nothing
unforeseen had happened to her since
her birth. At last she pulled down the 
shade on the window, lowered the back
of her seat as far as it would go, covered
herself to the waist with a blanket with-
out taking off her shoes, put on a sleep-
ing mask, turned her back to me and
slept without a single pause, without a
sigh, without the slightest change in po-
sition, for the eight eternal hours and 12


"You're not even slowing me down."

CEASE FIRING


an old military piece that harkens
back to time spent in the service.
  When these individuals purchase a
firearm of historic value for the office
or den, they are most likely joining
the fastest-growing segment of the
collecting fraternity and entering
the world of the nonfiring replica gun
collector.
  Not to be confused with toy guns,
nonfiring replicas are fabricated
mainly of a zinc-oxide alloy with pol-
ished hardwood grips or stocks. Ex-
cept to highly trained eyes, these
fakes can fool most people. They
have working actions, a familiar
weight and balance and a full comple-
ment of moving parts. They are, in
fact, authentic in every way except
one-~they cannot be fired. All the
parts have been altered by roughly a
millimeter so they cannot chamber or
fire live ammunition.
  It was during a trip to Japan 25
years ago that Thomas B. Nelson dis-
covered replica guns. Craftsmen
there were producing high-quality
replica firearms to satisfy collectors


hampered by the terms of occupation
following the second World War.
Even today, stringent laws in Japan
forbid personal ownership of authen-
tic handguns.
  At the time of Nelson's trip in
1967, lawmakers in the United States
were pushing for stricter gun-control
laws, and Nelson, a noted authority
on small arms, determined that new
laws would restrict the availability
and transfer of real firearms. Re-
turning home, Nelson decided that
the time was right to start an import
business for replica guns. In relative-
ly short order, he became one of the
leading distributors of nonfiring guns
in the world. Today, Nelson not only
sells guns from his own catalog, the
Collector's Armoury, in Alexandria,
Virginia, but also supplies most of
the other catalog and mail-order
companies. Many of these replicas
not only come from Japan, but from
Italy and Spain as well.
  Although replica guns are perfect
in every detail, they aren't deactivat-
ed originals nor are they made with


original parts. As noted, the dimen-
sions have been altered by a millime-
ter or two, and this means that actual
gun parts cannot be interchanged
with a replica to make it capable of
firing live ammunition. As a further
precaution, a high-carbon steel rod is
integrally formed along the axis of
the bore, blocking the entire length
of the barrel. According to Nelson,
each replica his company handles
passes inspection by the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and
each receives a certificate stating
that it isn't a firearm.
  Among the many advantages of
replica gun collecting is the ability to
own lookalike weapons that other-
wise are illegal to possess or require
cutting through extensive red tape.
One such popular piece is the
Thompson M1921 machine gun. The
replica version of the "Chicago Type-
writer," as it was called by gangsters
in the Roaring '20s, contains 59 parts,
including a vertical fore-grip and de-
tachable butt-stock and a 20-round
box magazine. It measures 35 in. long
and weighs 9~~~ pounds, just like its
real counterpart. Also, it can be com-
pletely disassembled.
  Another advantage of replica fire-
arms is price. The lookalike Thomp-
son M1921 submachine gun sells for
less than $300. A real Thompson
machine gun would cost as much as
$3000, plus a $200 payment of a
Federal Transfer Tax.
  Military buffs might be more in-
terested in the M1911 .45 automatic
pistol, a standard government Army-
issue sidearm that dates back to
1911. This familiar piece has seen
action in WWI, WWII, Korea and
Vietnam. Replicas are available for
roughly $100.
  Police buffs might be more inter-
ested in the .44 Magnum revolver
made famous by Clint Eastwood in
the "Dirty Harry" movies. This model
features a 6-shot swing-out cylinder
in both single and double action. Cost
is about $90.
  Like all products in the market-
place, replica guns are subject to the
whims of the public. During the
1960s and early 1970s, Western
quick-draw revolvers were tremen-
dously popular. During the mid-'70s,
the pistol used by agent 007, James
Bond, a German Walther PPK, was a
big-selling replica model. Modern
military and assault weapons, like
the Russian AK-47 assault rifle and
Israeli Uzi submachine gun, were
popular in the 1980s, and now Civil
War firearms are hot.
  While most of the firearms men-
tioned above are perennial favorites,
replicas are also made for fanciers
who wish to extend their collections


Replicas And The Law


~ Interestingly, recent gun-control legis-
lation has had little effect on the sale,
purchase or distribution of nonfiring repli-
ca firearms. However, under the terms
of the Federal Energy Management
Improvement Act of 1988, replica gun
fanciers were not so lucky.
  Under Part 1150 of Section 4, which
has become known as the Look-Alike
Law of 1988, it states that anything that
looks like a gun manufactured  after May
5, 1989 must conform to certain regula-
tions. For some models this means, "A
blaze orange solid plug will be perma-
nently affixed to the muzzle end of the
barrel as an integral part of the entire
device and recessed no more than 6mm
from the muzzle end of the barrel."
  For toy cap pistols, noisemakers,
water guns, light-emitting guns, air-gun
ejectile toys and lookalike firearms that
discharge such things as water, light and
nonmetallic projectiles, blaze orange
markings must be permanently affixed to
the exterior of the barrel, surrounding the
muzzle end for a depth of 8mm.

FOR SPEED


       MICROCARS

 URBAN ASSAULT VEHICLE

  Before you even ask, the answer is
  no. No, you cannot buy the new
  660-cc, DOHC, three-cylinder, in-
tercooled, turbocharged Mazda AZ-1
in the United States, even if you could
afford its $14,000 sticker price. The
plastic-bodied, bumperless micro-rock-
et would never meet U.S. crash safety
requirements, and tweaking its 64-
horsepower engine to pass our emis-
sions standards would erode the AZ-1's
40-mpg rating. But that didn't stop us
from throwing the mid-engine coupe
into Manhattan traffic to judge the
Japanese definition of an urban
assault vehicle.
  City vehicles need to accelerate
quickly, stop quickly, and feature good
mirrors. The AZ-1 scored well in all
three departments. Acceleration off
stop lights was brilliant, especially
when the turbo kicked in with a
scream at around 3,000 rpm. Four-
wheel disc brakes quickly checked the
1,587-pound car's excess speed and
the mirrors gave an ample view of the
New York traffic around us. Steering
was nimble and sure. Japan-market
city cars are, in some ways, an urban
commuter's dream.
  The AZ-1 failed on two key points,
however. Potholes ingested its little
13-inch wheels and strained the four-
wheel independent suspension; also,
the car's cute appearance and gull-
wing doors drew crowds anywhere it
was parked. That suggests it would
also attract thieves.


independent front and rear suspension, electron-
ic damping, and speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion
steering. These underpinnings allow Cadillac en-
gineers to pull off a real sleight-of-hand: In spite
of its size, the Concours handles like a true
sports sedan, with precise steering and road feel
and an isolated yet controlled ride. It's fast and
it sticks to the road, with none of the soft, wal-
lowing sensations of Cadillac's past efforts.
  Two details keep the Concours out of the true
sports sedan class: Instead of front bucket seats
and a console, there's a bench seat for three
passengers in front, a feature Cadillac says its
buyers demand. And the instrument cluster is
digital, with no analog display available.

reorganized its board and its top man-
agement structure.
  GM executives have said that plat-
forms and powertrains will be reduced
to a manageable few, and every re-
maining car and truck product line is
under pressure to become profitable in
short order or suffer cancellation,
though no divisions will be shut down
or merged at this point. The automak-
er recently announced 14 immediate
model cancellations, however.
  Thus, GM's overall product plans for
1994 include not a single new car, but
rather revolve around passive re-
straint systems, elimination of slow-
selling models, and engine consolida-
tion. GM will also be shuffling its
relationships with Japanese partners
Isuzu, Suzuki, and Toyota as Isuzu ex-
its the passenger car business, upset-
ting the Geo supply line.

  Exactly how this will shake out is
  not yet clear, but GM's initial strat-
  egy is to be aggressive with new
trucks, starting with the new S-10
compact series replacements this fall,
followed by the new S-10 Blazer in
1995 and then a new minivan. The lat-
ter, a replacement for the APV, merits
attention not because of its market po-
sition in a category rapidly becoming
dominated by Ford and Chrysler prod-
ucts, but because it represents a test
bed for composite technology. Although
GM is studying an all-steel minivan,

THE  PREVENTION PROGRAM


working out on cross-country ma-
chines (25 percent).
  That doesn't quite measure up to
the Prevention Program's activity
plan. It advocates a full hour of ac-
tivity a day-~30 minutes of aerobic
exercise, plus 20 minutes of resis-
tance training three times a week.
(Only 22 percent of our respondents
said they lifted weights before they
began the program.) The rest of the
hour should be filled with "lifestyle
workouts"-~like mowing the lawn,
vacuuming or taking the stairs in-
stead of the elevator.
Diet Kudos to the 89 percent of our
respondents who said they try to eat
low-fat and nonfat foods! And con-
grats to the almost three-fourths
who make high-fiber foods, fish and
poultry (instead of meat), and low-
cholesterol foods a part of their di-
ets. But respondents were caught
lagging behind when it comes to eat-
ing their fruits and vegetables-~only
54 percent said they try to eat at
least five servings of produce a day.
And only 52 percent reported
watching their sodium intake by
eating low-sodium foods, which
may help stave off high blood pres-
sure in some people.
Blood pressure Fully 86 percent of our
respondents reported blood pressure
levels less than 140/90. If your blood
pressure's higher than that, make sure
you're under a doctor's care. There's
a good chance that, if your blood


pressure is 130-139 over 85-89,
lifestyle changes like those advocated
by the Prevention Program may bring
your blood pressure down-~without
hypertensive drugs. (See "Gentle
Remedies," July 1993.)
Smoking While 96 percent of our re-
spondents said they don't currently
smoke, almost half of them once
practiced the unhealthy habit, and
then quit. "Smoking is thrombo-
genic-~it causes blood clots that may
clog your arteries," Dr. Kottke says.
"But heart-disease risk from smoking
goes back to baseline about two years
after you stop the habit."
Supplements More than half of our
respondents were taking multimin-
eral/multivitamins when they began
the Prevention Program, and about
40 percent were supplementing their
diets with vitamins C and E, so-called
antioxidants that preliminary re-
search has linked to lower risk of
heart disease and heart attack. Only
17 percent of our respondents were
taking supplements of beta-carotene,
another antioxidant.
  Of course, supplements can't sub-
stitute for a healthy diet like the Pre-
vention Program eating plan. But the
evidence that they can help is get-
ting stronger all the time. For more
information about supplements,
see the third Prevention Program up-
date, "The Cardio-Nutrients," in
our May 1993 issue.

YOUR HEALTHY PET


narian called her back to say that the
blood results were normal. But when
he heard about Berra's new symptoms,
he recommended Donna consult a spe-
cialist-~a veterinary neurologist.
  Donna made the appointment
promptly. She was beginning to have a
few suspicions of her own as to a pos-
sible cause. Donna and Berra were con-
stant companions on long walks in
the New England woods. And along
with picturesque scenery, those re-
gions of New England are famous
for something less pretty: deer ticks
(now called black-legged ticks), the
carriers of Lyme disease.
  So Donna brought Berra to a veteri-
nary neurologist. But Berra was feeling
good that particular day. She was
hardly limping at all. The veterinarian
could find no other typical symptoms
of Lyme disease: no fever, no swollen
wrist joints, no abnormalities in the
joint fluid. Still, there was that strange
jaw paralysis and the lethargy. The fact
that it was winter also made Lyme dis-
ease less likely: The disease is usually
transmitted and diagnosed in the sum-
mer. So the doctor drew blood to test
for a variety of diseases. Just to be on
the safe side, he ordered a test for Lyme
disease. And he sent Donna and Berra
home, again without treatment.
  A few days later, Donna received the
long-awaited answer. The neurologist
called to say that Donna's instincts had
apparently been right: Berra's blood
test showed the presence of antibodies

the big tools. We began using 
small tools instead to scrape 
away the rock. As soon as we
could see a bone, we coated
it with glue to make it stronger.
  Soon we could see that the
skeleton was nearly 40 feet (12
m) long and was curled up on
its left side. Before we dug the
bones out of the ground, we
drew a map of where each
bone lay. We would need the
map later to study the way the 
bones were buried. That
would help us figure out how
this dinosaur had died.
  After finishing the map, we
began digging out the bones.
We dug around the bones so


a lot of rock and dirt stayed
attached to them. This way we
could be sure we got all of
the bones. And the extra rock
and dirt helped protect them.
  Then we coated the bun-
dles with plaster. The plaster
would protect the bones on
their trip to the museum.
  We still had another prob-
lem. The biggest fossil bun-
dles weighed several tons.

that's already dead. T. rex may
have had the same choices.
  We'll keep studying these
bones and looking for other
clues. To me, that's the fun of
being a dinosaur scientist. I'm
just glad to be living 65 mil-
lion years after the tyrant liz-
ard king ruled! ~

  SHE MOPED. She sighed. She
  wandered around the house
  with the look of an injured
puppy, sometimes bursting into
tears. When her worried parents
questioned her, she would answer,
"It's nothing." How could she ex-
plain she was desperately in love for
the first time, and the object of her
adoration didn't even know she
existed? Finally her father sat
down, took her hand and tenderly
questioned her until he learned the


cause of her sadness. Gently, sim-
ply, he talked with her of life and
love. He comforted her. She was six
years old.
  "I've never forgotten that mo-
ment," says Kathleen Kilpatrick, a
special assistant in the office of the
U.S. Secretary of the Interior.
"How often I've thought back and
wondered that he didn't just laugh
at me. Instead, he treated me with
dignity and concern for how deeply
I felt."
  Robert Kilpatrick, now retired
board chairman of CIGNA Corp.,
never took a course in parenting.
He was simply showing love for
his daughter, giving her his time
and trying to see the world
through her eyes. It would be hard
to come up with a better formula
for fatherhood.
  "Fathers bring a unique pres-
ence, a special strength to raising


Guarendi's book shows that tradi-
tional values, rooted in the bedrock
of mutual trust, truth and uncondi-
tional love, are still the keys to
successful child-rearing. And in
this setting, fathers bring special
gifts to parenting.
  Sometimes fatherly instincts
come easily; sometimes they have to
be cultivated. But their payoff in
lasting, positive effects on growing
children is enormous. Here, culled
from real-life experience, is what
kids need most from a dad:
  Someone who shows his love for
them. Kenneth Meade, pastor of the
Church of Christ at Manor Woods,
in Rockville, Md., says one of the
most frequently expressed desires
in his family counseling comes
from children saying, "I wish Dad
would tell me or show he really
loves me." Time after time, clergy-
men, counselors and psychologists
encounter variations of this theme-~
children, often grown men, longing
for more expressed affection from
their fathers. "I never doubted my
father's love," writes author Walt
Harrington, "but even today I can't
recall a time he hugged or kissed
me or said he loved me."
  Such overt expressions give
needed assurance and encourage-
ment. Motivational expert Zig Zig-
lar had this confirmed in reverse


one day when he was trying to
assemble a tricycle he had just
bought for his then-four-year-old
son, Tom. Ziglar became more ex-
asperated by the minute because
the proverbial bolt A was not fit-
ting into nut B. He was about to
give up when Tom, who was look-
ing on, suddenly blurted, "I sure do
love you, Dad!" Needless to say,
Ziglar finished putting together
that tricycle.
  Guarendi found that "in strong
families, fathers who had problems
expressing affection made special
efforts to show it." Some who
couldn't say it wrote it in a letter,
card or note on the back of one of
their children's drawings. One fa-
ther, adept at composing music,
writes songs to his kids to tell them
he loves them.
  Fathers might also consider a
technique used by a mother in
Utah. Knowing her children were
uncomfortable with public displays
of affection, she worked out a secret
code, known only to her kids.
When one of them was about to
participate in a sport or other school
activity, she would squeeze the
child's shoulder, meaning "I love
you."
  An important "surrogate" way
for a father to convey affection to a
child is through the affection he

know it."
  We see the change in her attitude
begin with an ice storm that dis-
rupts power in Atlanta. After mak-
ing his way to her house over slick
roads, Hoke tells Daisy, "I figured
your stove was out. I know you gots
to have your coffee in the morn-
ing." At the end of the film, she
takes his hand and confesses,
"You're my best friend. You are,
you are."
  Driving Miss Daisy is now on
Variety's list of all-time box-office
champs. Jessica Tandy won the Os-
car for Best Actress. Dan Aykroyd,
who played Daisy's son, and Mor-
gan Freeman were also nominated
for Oscars.
  "When I was a kid, I wanted to
be a movie star," Freeman says.
"Somewhere along the way, I
started to think, `No. Stardom is
nothing. I want to change people's
attitudes. I want to make movies
that mend us. I want to be a force
for healing.'
  "I have a large stake in the future
that movies like Driving Miss Daisy
are helping to bring about. I tell my
children and grandchildren it's will-
power that does things. All it takes is
one individual to say, `This will
stop'-~or to start something good."

him or herself, she isn't sure.
  Soon, she thinks, he'll wonder why
I'm not getting pregnant. He'll want to
have tests run, start talking about alter-
natives: adoption, in vitro, surrogates.
Finally it will come out, I'll have to tell
him. Then he'll divorce me. She sees
herself banished to the city-~supplant-
ed here by a Sherry or a Donna, a will-

  "What I'm trying to tell you, Meg,
is you can't worry about that. You'll

  Meg frowns. This sounds like non-
sense to her. In other sports-~basket-
ball, archery, skeet, hockey, she thinks,
listing them all in her mind-~the target,
the goal, is the focal point. She imag-
ines a football field with no goal posts,
the players running amok, aimlessly
bumping into one another, their eyes
glued to the ball. "But how can you be
sure it'll get in?" she asks.
  "Well, you can't! Even the pros
double-fault sometimes. But you sure as
hell can't guarantee it the way you're


doing it." He hands her another ball.
"Just try it. Have a little faith."
  Meg tosses the ball up high, higher
than she usually does, and swings her
racket back so far it touches her shoul-
der blades. Look at the ball, she tells
herself sternly, but already she feels
herself resisting. Reflexively, guiltily,
she focuses across the net, and watches
for what seems like minutes as the ball
falls wide and long.

"OH, MY GOD!" DONNA HOLDS HER
fork in  midair and stares at nothing.
A blob of chicken salad drops to the
tablecloth.
  "What is it?" Meg asks.
  Donna frowns, then smiles, her face
relaxing. "Nothing. False alarm. I
thought my water broke."
  This time it's Meg who says, "Oh,
my God." She feels a surge of annoy-
ance. Somehow, she suspects this is typ-
ical of Donna: blithely lunching out,
chancing delivery on a restaurant floor.
  "Don't worry, it hasn't," Donna says.
  Meg smiles primly. "I guess, this
being your second time, you're taking it
pretty casually."
  "Well, Bobby is eight, after all. His
birth isn't exactly fresh in my memory.
But it is a relief not to have to go through
this one alone." Donna pats her belly.
"Russ has been carrying a beeper
around. He can't wait."
  "Where was Russ for Bobby's birth?"
Meg asks.      (continued on page 84)

UPPER-CLASS LIFE

The problem with PC
Being politically correct-~PC-~at
college is more than simply having
"correct" political views. It con-
notes a certain attitude-~a
consciousness. PC was originally
supposed to ensure that students
in diverse college communities were sensi-
tive to ethnic differences and used nondis-
criminatory and inoffensive language. All
good intentions. But being PC isn't just
about the language you use. It's the clothes
you buy, the music you listen to, and every-
thing you read. It's the difference between
Andrew Dice Clay and Jerry Seinfeld.
  My college, Brown University, in Provi-


dence, Rhode Island, is an ac-


rect pervades student


impossible to be apolitical at my school-~it's
as if there's one way to think and feel about
a million different issues, and when I don't
agree with the accepted point of view, or I
don't have any opinion on an issue, I'm some
reactionary pig.
  In my freshman year at Brown, I pretty
much followed along with the PC herd. I re-
cycled, I bought a Brown mug to use instead
of Styrofoam cups, I even came to love those
Guatemalan sweaters that you can so conve-
niently purchase at the Brown Post Office.

COMINGS & GOINGS


WHO'S COMING

ALL MY CHILDREN
Sydney Penny (no character name at press time)
Penny won an Emmy nomination for her portrayal of B.J.
Walker on the now-defunct SANTA BARBARA. The ac-
tress will be joining the AMC cast in a role created for
her in mid-September. Although some published reports
indicated that the new character's name would be Julia,
that could not be confirmed at press time. For more de-
tails, see page 8.

Rudolf Martin (no character name at press time)
When this German actor auditioned for Alec McIntyre
(the role went to Grant Aleksander), the producers took
notice and created another AMC role for Martin. He will
first appear at the end of summer portraying a college stu-
dent from Budapest whom Dimitri sponsors. Actress Glo-
ria Crist, who screen-tested with Martin, reports that "he
is gorgeous and sexy -~ and a great actor."

LOVING
Debbi Morgan (Dr. Angie Hubbard)
Morgan rose to prominence in her Emmy-winning role
as Dr. Angie Hubbard on AMC. She also played the role
of Chantal on GENERATIONS. Now Morgan, the wife
of actor Charles Dutton (ROC), has returned to LOV-
ING's Corinth to begin an integral role as Shana's (Su-
san Keith) physician. For more details, see page 5.

BOLD AND BEAUTIFUL
Robert Gentry (Elliott Parker)
Best remembered as ALL MY CHILDREN's Ross, Gen-
try portrays the Forresters' attorney as the family seeks
to bring down Brooke (Katherine Kelly Lang). His first
airdate was July 20.

WHO'S GOING

GUIDING LIGHT
Beth Ehlers (Harley Cooper)
The show has confirmed that Ehlers will be leaving in
September. For more info, see page 6.


Mark Derwin (A.C. Mallet)
Derwin, in tandem with Ehlers, his on-screen/off-screen
love, will also hit the road in September. Check out page
6 for details.

Jordan Clarke (Billy Lewis)
Clarke's last appearance was mid-July. For more info,
see page 6.

ANOTHER WORLD
Jamie Goodwin (Kevin Anderson)
Executive Producer Michael Laibson says that "we would
not have [let him go] if it weren't necessary in terms of
the story we're going to be telling. [Goodwin's] last air-
date will be in September."

Alla Korot (Jenna Norris)
Korot has chosen to leave in December when her con-
tract is up; the role will most likely be recast.

Ricky Paull Goldin (Dean Frame)
Goldin has decided to leave at the end of the year. Michael
Laibson, addressing the departures of both Korot and
Goldin, says, "The actors will be leaving when their con-
tracts expire."

GENERAL HOSPITAL
Randolph Mantooth (Richard Halifax)
Mantooth left Port Charles on July 23. For the story on
his exit, turn to page 10.

LOVING
Anders Hove (Cesar Faison)
Hove's treachery in Corinth will be short-lived when Ava
and Jeremy (Lisa Peluso and Jean LeClerc) beat him
at his own game on August 3. For more details on the sto-
ryline, read Behind The Scene on page 26.

YOUNG AND RESTLESS
Peter Barton (Scott Grainger)
Barton has been taken off contract and relegated to re-
curring status. (While he's not off the show, don't ex-
pect to see him often.)


you can't eat compliments," Charlie Brown's dog Snoopy
once groaned, but maybe he was just peeved because Lucy
gets more fan mail than he does. The truth is, you can eat
compliments -~ they fortify the soul, nourish the spirit, and best
of all, there's no expiration date on the label.
  To civilians (people who claim they don't have time to watch
soaps; meanwhile, they've got their nose buried in some trashy ro-
mance novel), all soaps look the same. You and I know better. Wake
us in the middle of the night, and we can tell you instantly the dif-
ference between a BOLD AND BEAUTIFUL fashion show (it's
flashier), an ANOTHER WORLD cocktail hour (it's feistier) and
a GUIDING LIGHT garden party (it's funnier).
  Every show has some unique element -~ some spark of magic
-~ that lifts it above the rest. So, let's toast those elements with a
few words and a big pat on the back. As the Great Philosopher Bea-
gle also said, talk is cheap, but "a hug is better than all the theol-
ogy in the world."

OUTDOORS SOUTH


Ice Age


Orphans


  We Southerners, accustomed to a
mild climate, don't readily relate to
tales of the Ice Age. Talk of Pleis-
tocene glaciers from millennia ago,
and we doze off. But give us a three-
hanky drama about orphans stranded
in the mountains and we perk up,
ready to pull on hiking boots and
charge to the rescue.
  I know one pocket of biological
wonder where the two subjects curi-
ously merge. Cranberry Glades, a
spongy peat bog in the mountains of
southern West Virginia, reflects a fro-
zen past and harbors enough plant
species of that era to pass as a botan-
ical orphanage.
  Most of the South's wetlands lie
along steamy coasts and lowland
rivers. This cool cousin huddles at
3,400 feet, among mountains more
than a thousand feet higher, which
trap cold air. The isolated valley-~
especially 750 acres of open glades,
boggy forest, and dense alder thick-
ets-~resembles arctic tundra typi-
cally found far to the north in Canada.
  If the Ice Age was the train that
carried colonies of flora and fauna
south for a long vacation, Cranberry's
exotic residents are the stragglers
that missed the boarding call when
the cold pulled out. Had they not


Nashville warbler find their south-
ernmost breeding range here.
  Cranberry Glades' beauty is sub-
tle. At first glance, the flat meadows
and low hummocks appear to be a
fairly mundane landscape nestled
among stands of red spruce, eastern
hemlock, yellow birch, and other
trees common to cool heights.
  Bend down close, however, and
find surprises in the details. Tiny pink
orchids bloom in midsummer among
delicate cinnamon ferns. The name-
sake cranberry vines, their fingernail-
size flowers giving way to equally
small reddish fruit from summer to
fall, weave among sphagnum moss.
Carnivorous sundews, also squatting
low, wait patiently for flies to alight
fatally on their sticky faces. Only the
modest stalks of skunk cabbage,
sedge, and tufts of cotton grass gain
any height over the glades.
  The entire menagerie grows on the
surface of wet, spongy peat moss
that varies greatly in depth. A person
could sink ankle deep in what looks
like a firm field. (To protect the
glades, the Forest Service requires
visitors to use a ~~~-mile boardwalk.)
  I must admit, orchids and peat
moss did not first draw me. I origi-
nally went for outdoor adventure in
the surrounding 26,000-acre Cran-


berry Back Country and 35,864-acre
Cranberry Wilderness, also parts of
Monongahela National Forest. With
school friends, in every season and all
types of weather, I explored rugged
terrain along 100 miles of trails.
  For day trips we rode knobby-tired
bikes into the backcountry or carried
fishing gear into the wilderness. For
longer outings we shouldered heavy
backpacks. Often we started from
trailheads along the Highlands Scenic
Highway, a ridge road lined with
spruce trees and providing magnifi-
cent views into Cranberry country.
  One fall, after an early snow, we
set out to track black bear and hap-
pened upon woodchucks, hawks, wild
turkeys, and snowshoe hares as well.
In winters so deep we got a taste of
what the Ice Age must have been
like, we sipped piping hot coffee
while camped beside frozen forks of
the Cranberry or Williams Rivers.
  With passing years I have mounted
wilderness treks less often, and lin-
gered more among the glades' hum-
ble plants. Perhaps it takes maturity
to appreciate those biological waifs,
fated by prehistoric coincidence to
exist in isolation. I still find it hard
to picture my Southern homeland
shivering for centuries, but I have
come to admire those sturdy species
that came south and-~at least
here-~managed to find a home.

If country ham, turnip greens, and
black-eyed peas are some of your
favorite foods, you're in good
company. But if you think those
down-home flavors might just be too
informal for your next fancy gather-
ing, think again.
  After readers called us, requesting
a uniquely Southern reception menu,
we decided to give it a try. The result
is a feast of finger foods, appetizers,
and a beverage fit for even the finest
of parties.
  For starters, we dressed uniquely
Southern foods in their Sunday best,
transforming black-eyed peas into a
tangy salsa, and using turnip greens
as the base for a hot, cheesy dip. The
salty tingle of country ham and the
straightforward taste of buttermilk in-
spired us further, so we've used
those flavors in a showy canap~~ and
in pecan-studded chicken fingers. In
all the recipes in this menu, we kept
an eye out for ease of preparation,
too. Only one of the dishes-~Shrimp-
and-Cucumber Canap~~s-~involves
piping using a pastry bag.
  More than anything, this menu
captures the excitement of celebrat-
ing, so serve your Southern heritage
with pride. These recipes will show
you how.

4 ~ 100-meter relay team. Cornerback
James Trapp, a third-round draft choice,
was an alternate on that same relay team.
And maybe there'll be Ismail, who can
hang with any of these guys.
  It's a freakish team. "There are lots of
fast football players," says Gault. "It's be-
come a speed game. But there's speed
and there's elite speed. As far as elite
speed, the league's got about a dozen
such players. We have half of them."
  This is not necessarily an advantage. Of
those six, only Gault and McDaniel have
made any kind of impact. But, as far as
Davis is concerned, speed is the way to go.
  Growing up in Brooklyn, Davis was in-
trigued by both the Yankees and the
Dodgers. "The Yankees had power, size,
and created fear," he says. "The Dodgers
believed in speed and in development;
they were willing to take chances. For the
Raiders, I wanted both. I never could un-
derstand why you couldn't have both."
  Speed means big plays and sudden
strikes that demoralize opponents with
their swiftness. Having speed puts tre-
mendous pressure on defenses. Davis be-
lieves that his sprinters don't have to
catch the ball to be dangerous. Their pres-
ence is electric enough to alter a game's
dynamics, moving the defense off the line
and creating space for an offense.
"Speed," says Davis, "is an integral part
of fear. As you know, we've always said
we'd rather be feared than respected."
  Davis was The Citadel's chief recruiter
in 1955, when he landed an All-America
sprinter out of Philadelphia named Ange-
lo Coia. Coia enjoyed a seven-year career
in the NFL and, not at all incidentally,
is now a scout for the Raiders. The bias of
the personnel department toward
speed-~Kent McCloughan, a former
Raider cornerback, is another scout who
was a high school All-America in track-~
is as natural as it is mandated. To this day,
part of a Raider scouting report is a work-
up on the player's high school track
experience.
  This emphasis doesn't always pay off.
Bo Roberson was a silver medalist in the
1960 Games in the long jump, and al-
though Davis kept him on the Raiders for
four seasons, he is not remembered as
having been anything more than a "com-
plement" to the offense. Jimmy Hines,
one of those sensational sprinters that
came out of Texas in the '60s, was picked
up by Davis even though his nickname
was Ooops! and two other teams had


dropped him. In the end, Davis could find
no better use for Hines than to fly him to
camp every Wednesday, dress him, report
him to the league as being there for a try-
out and use him during one practice to
challenge his cornerbacks. "You could do
that back then," says Al LoCasale, Davis's
longtime assistant. Well, the Raiders
could.
  But what do you say then of Cliff
Branch? He was an Olympic-level sprint-
er who languished until the fourth round
of the 1972 draft before Davis's scouts fi-
nally pulled the trigger. "Took two years
to get him ready," says Davis. Branch
ended his career with 501 catches, second


of an experiment. Initially a wide receiver,
he was converted to defense his sopho-
more season at Tennessee. He ended up
becoming an All-America and the Raid-
ers' first-round draft choice in 1988.
  Others, though, either by their nature
or their experience, are track men who
are under development. Graddy, yet an-
other Vol, insists he is a football person
but admits the sheer lack of repetitions
has handicapped him. In fact, he only
made the Tennessee team as a walk-on.
And despite subsequently breaking the
world record in the 60-yard dash, he
couldn't shake loose for more than three
catches his senior year. The Denver Bron-


JUNIOR'S HOT JULY
Over a nine-day span, from July 20 to 28,
Mariner centerfielder Ken Griffey Jr. tied
a major league record by hitting a home
run in eight consecutive games. To appre-
ciate how remarkable that feat is, consid-
er the following:
~ Griffey, the Pirates' Dale Long (1956)
and the Yankees' Don Mattingly (1987)
are the only three players in history to
homer in eight straight games. No other
major leaguer has reached seven straight,
and only 10 have hit homers in six games
in a row.
~ Had Griffey homered on July 29, he
would have done what 18 teams have not
done this year-~hit a home run in nine
consecutive games.
~ During the streak, Griffey hit more
homers than 11 teams did.
~ Besides Griffey, only three Mariners
have gotten a hit in eight straight games
this season. Don't laugh. Eight-game hit-
ting streaks aren't as easy as they sound.


the fourth game of the streak, Cleveland
manager Mike Hargrove, figuring his
team wasn't having any luck against Grif-
fey anyway, instructed catcher Junior Or-
tiz to tell Griffey what pitch was coming
from Albie Lopez. Ortiz did. "I popped
up," Griffey said. On Griffey's next at bat,
Ortiz wasn't telling. Griffey homered.
  The night the streak ended, 45,607
fans-~including 30,220 who bought tick-
ets the day of the game, the most walk-ups
in Mariner history-~came to the King-
dome to see if Griffey could break the
record. The crowd cheered his every
move. "If he had hit a home run his last at
bat," said Mariner pitcher Erik Hanson,
"the roof would have come off, and we'd
have an outdoor stadium."

BRAVES' NEW WORLD
It was no coincidence that in first base-
man Fred McGriff's first week with At-
lanta, the Braves scored 10 or more runs
in four consecutive games for the first
time since the team moved to Atlanta in
1966. Through Sunday, McGriff had
started 11 games since coming over from
San Diego, and the second-place Braves
won 10 of them. In McGriff's 11 starts the
team averaged 8.8 runs and pounded 23
homers. McGriff batted .404 with seven
homers and 13 RBIs.
  Atlanta general manager John Schuer-
holz says the awakening of the Braves'
bats "is because of Fred. This was a good
offensive team lying in wait, but it hadn't
been kick-started until his arrival. Before,
you'd look in the eyes of these players and
you'd see them battling to carry the club.
Now you look in those same eyes, and you
see the eyes of the hunter."
  The team the Braves are chasing may
well be uncatchable-~at week's end the
Giants led by 7~~~ games, and 15 of the 56
games left on their schedule were against
the Marlins, the Rockies and the Pa-
dres-~but with McGriff, Atlanta at least
has hope. "He has given us a shot of
B-12," says outfielder Otis Nixon. "He's
relaxed our big guns. When you have ter-
rific pitching like ours, it adds more pres-
sure when you don't hit. But the attitude
has changed with Fred. We definitely
think we can get back in this thing."
  The Braves traded for McGriff to try to
win this year. Don't be surprised if they
deal him after the season-~not because
they don't like him, but because his salary
is $4.25 million both this year and next,
and he can be a free agent after the '94


MONACO could soon have
a new princess -~ a stun-
ning beauty who could
share the Riveria tax-haven
throne with Prince Albert.
  Supermodel Claudia Schiffer
and the heir to the throne,
Prince Albert, have gone public
with their romance, kissing and
hugging at an exclusive Paris
fashion show.
  Now the residents of Monaco
are wondering just when Prin-
cess Grace's only son will walk
down the aisle with the sexy
German model.
  "Schiffer has spent a lot of
time in St. Tropez lately, and
that's not far from Albert's
home in Monaco," says a
source. "Perhaps she was stay-
ing there to be close to the
prince."
  But if the couple were quiet
about their relationship in the
past, they were anything but
private in their public display
of affection in Paris.
  "The debut of the fall-winter
collections in Paris is a big
event," says the source. "Any-
body who is anybody shows up,
and there was Albert, sitting in
the front row."
  As Claudia, 22, one of the
world's most sought-after mod-
els, sashayed down the runway,
Albert, 35, had the best seat in

  TVG: Are there crossover plans for
the casts of the two current series?
  RB: My guess is that next year, when
Next Generation goes off the air, we'll
have an opportunity for a whole bunch
of stars to do that. Q (John DeLancie)
came to Deep Space Nine last season,
and we plan to keep the character alive.
Lwaxana (Majel Barrett) will be seen on
both series next season. I think we'll also
have some Deep Space people crossing
over to Next Generation.
  TVG: What happened to the announc-
ed plans for Whoopi Goldberg (Guinan)
to pop up on Deep Space Nine?
  RB: She has told me that she'd be hap-
py to do Deep Space, but we're gonna
wait and see. One of the problems with
Whoopi is her schedule. The bigger a star
she gets, the harder it is for her to find
time to come do our show. We can't just
say, `Oh, Whoopi's available in two weeks,
let's just slap her into a script.' We need
to develop a story in which her character
is an integral part. But she is coming
back to Next Generation for what will be
her sixth season-~and we have one story
that has to do with one of Guinan's chil-
dren, which could work equally well on
either series.

accessories information

When I wrote The Spy Who Came In from
the Cold, the head of operations at the Se-
cret Intelligence Service remarked that it
was the only bloody double agent that ever
worked. The mythmaking that went on all
around us contributed to the kind of in-
grown and corrosive self-perceptions that
were at the heart of our undoing.

Q. You worked in British intelligence as a
young man. How do you look back upon
those years now?

A. I was recruited almost when I was still
in diapers into that world. My really for-
mative years, the years when one should
be having nice little love affairs and doing
different jobs and finding out who one
shouldn't be and that stuff, they were all
taken over by the secret world. The moods
that I remember, the self-perceptions I


had, were very positive, very negative; I
was brilliant, I was a complete idiot. I en-
tered it in the spirit of John Buchan and
left it in the spirit of Kafka.

Q. Was there a particular incident that
formed your view of espionage?

A. I remember one episode where I was
obliged to interrogate a British official
about his alleged involvement in an espio-
nage ring, and he lied to me. He just lied all
the way through. I made a very reasoned
submission to my superiors and went on
to other things and discovered to my as-
tonishment a few months later, this man
had been promoted. So I was terribly wor-
ried, and I started to shake the bars. Final-
ly I was taken aside and told to ask no
more questions about the matter. And of
course years later I realized that he had


been our man, our informant, inside the
ring that we had penetrated. Therefore I
was actually simply part of his cover story.
All they wanted me to do was rubber-
stamp him so he could get on with his life
again.

Q. How do you ensure that the spies remain
honest brokers of intelligence and don't try
to distort it for their own ends?

A. What we've seen again and again, when
there's been a Watergate or there's been
something else, is this curious mixture
that includes the real zealots who believe
they can repair the inadequacies of the
democratic system by doing unofficial
things. They think they're the heroes.
Then you see the total misfits who need to
take shelter in secret rooms and who actu-
ally get off being secretive.
  It is actually only very excited, over-
stimulated men on very short sleep, to-
gether with all the toys of supersecrecy
and the helicopters and the special passes,
that inevitably produce irrational behav-
ior. But those people, when they began,
were ordinary guys; they were like us.
No~~~l Annan, who was in British intelli-
gence for years, said nobody should be al-
lowed to do it more than three years, that
one way of keeping an intelligence service
sane is to have it run entirely by tempo-
rary people.

Q. When the cold war ended, did you feel
any nostalgia?

A. I didn't have nostalgia, but I went
through some of the trauma that the
spooks had definitely been through. Was
there nothing there? Maybe it was all a
waste of life. Maybe I should have just
been running a boy's club. I had this
weird kind of sub-life in some part of my
head, where I sort of kept up with events
from a spy's-eye view. I was never a very
good spook; I was definitely a writer who
took up spying rather than a spy who
took up writing.

Q. So you were happy to see the cold war
end...

A. Yeah, I was thrilled. Part of my present
indignation is that I want the world to be a
better place now. I think the Americans
have the energy and the record and the
right to conduct the altruistic crusade. I
think it's totally incorrect politically to
suggest it, but a new period of altruistic
white colonialism is upon us.

Q. Pax Americana Moralistica?

A. Yes, a little bit, although I don't think it
need be as expansive as we fear. I don't
see you sort of ferrying your armed po-
lice all over the world keeping order. I
think it's much more how you throw
your weight in the world arena political-
ly, and how you demonstrate your out-
rage at flagrant misbehavior in places
where it can be stopped.		~


chaotic politics. U.S. Trade Representa-
tive Mickey Kantor arrived in Tokyo Tues-
day looking for someone in the mood to ne-
gotiate in preparation for the Group of
Seven summit meeting next week. It is un-
likely that Miyazawa's lame-duck govern-
ment will offer any major new trade con-
cessions or initiatives to help boost the
world economy, increasing chances that
the Tokyo summit will be stillborn.
  The fervent hope among most Japa-
nese is that the emerging new order will
destroy the powerful interest groups that
have dominated the political and business
arenas, eventually producing a genuine
multiparty democracy of ideas rather than

are they rats fleeing a sinking ship? Hata
and all his colleagues were members of the
Takeshita faction of the L.D.P., which was
close to the center of all the corruption
scandals in recent years.
  What is more, the political engineer
behind Hata's insurgency is Ichiro Ozawa,
a tough backroom operator who was right-
hand man to Shin Kanemaru, the Take-
shita faction's Mr. Big until prosecutors
caught up with him last March. Kanemaru

The Shores of
Tripoli
Leptis Magna, Libya


By Ian Keown

In the early 1950s, Britain was still a
major player in the Middle East,
part of Libya was still called Tripoli-
tania, Muammar el-Qaddafi was still
a high school lad, and I was a Royal
Air Force signaler at the RAF's Idris
air base just outside Tripoli. A sig-
naler's lot was not an onerous one-~

U.K. to Dhahran, Karachi, Kuala


close to five minutes. The blows
were so savage that they crushed
pieces of Denny's skull into his
brain, fractured his face in 90 to
100 spots and dislocated his left
eye so that it would have
dropped into his sinus cavity had
surgeons not replaced a crushed
bone with a piece of plastic.
  His assailants, though, still
weren't satisfied. Next they pro-
ceeded to demean Denny. As the
36-year-old trucker lay bleeding
and senseless, Damian Williams
thrust his arms upward in cele-
bration and did a victory dance,
imitating a receiver who has just
beaten his defender for a touch-
down and then points back at
him in taunting recognition. Wil-
liams then flashed the Eight Tray
Gangster Crips sign to the crowd
across the street and looked up at
the news helicopters and pointed
out Denny. Another gang mem-
ber, Anthony Brown, joined him,
flashing the Eight Tray sign be-
fore spitting on Denny.
  As Williams and Brown
walked away, Denny lay in the
street like a curiosity item. Sever-
al men darted up to throw liquor
bottles at him. A man whom po-

a process server for a law firm-~

information is scarce, change is risky and
training is expensive-~especially for the
small firms that employ roughly half of
American workers. "Saturn sent 99 man-
agers and workers around the world
studying other companies," says Appel-
baum. "How many firms can afford
that?" Not many. That's why govern-
ment has a potentially important role to
play. Although the Labor Department
has ruled out training mandates for em-
ployers, it is considering a special agency
that could study high-wage companies,
organize low-cost training consortia and
perhaps subsidize training with seed-
money grants. And last week's confer-
ence? It's tentatively set for July. In the
meantime, here's how three companies
created good jobs at good wages.

have to break it down into a few
steps. First, take your age and
subtract it from 220 to get your
maximal heart rate. Then multi-
ply that number by 0.7. The result
is your target heart rate, roughly
70 percent of your maximal rate.
  Once you have figured that out,
you know about how many times

The fitter you are,
the harder it is to hit
your target number

per minute your heart should beat
when you're exercising. So when
you're riding the stationary bike,
take your pulse rate for 10 sec-
onds. Then multiply the number
of beats by 6 to get the number
of beats per minute. (That's much
easier than trying to take your
pulse for a whole minute.) Always
remember that the better your
level of conditioning, the harder
it will be to reach your target rate.
  My answer to the second part


It's great to hear that you have
found an activity that you enjoy,
and that you want to take your
swimming to the next level.
  Swimming is a terrific exercise,
because it works so many muscle
groups at once. I would suggest
that you go to a gym and get some
good instruction in strength train-
ing. Most of the power motion
that you need in swimming comes
from the upper body, of course,
so concentrate on that. The latis-
simi dorsi, the large muscles just
below your shoulder blades, are
extremely important. You use
them in almost all swimming
strokes. In ordinary life situa-
tions, you don't work them so
much, but a good instructor can
show you the proper exercises for
developing the lats. Abdominal
exercises are important, too.
  It also is essential for all swim-
mers to concentrate on flexibility
-~ especially for the butterfly and
backstroke, where you need to
focus on shoulder stretching
exercises. And in all events you
need to develop flexibility in your

ington Post and Newsweek, announced
that she was going straight home. This
was thought to be a reproach, even a
gesture (though it later transpired that
Mrs. G. actually had the flu). In the re-
sulting flutter of reaction, Lady Rams-
botham vowed to discontinue the age-
old practice of "ladies' withdrawal," and
in swift succession nearly every George-
town mansion followed suit. "The only
exception was Pamela Harriman's," says
Peter Jay, who succeeded Sir Peter
Ramsbotham as ambassador, "and ev-
eryone knows that Mrs. Harriman is a
law unto herself."
  True, no doubt, but that law, however
phrased, is still something of an English
law. It was the British who started the
idea of strict precedence and sexual seg-
regation at Washington dinners. Pamela
Harriman operates at the crucial inter-
section of Washington where living mem-
ories of Churchill and the Blitz-~shared
by veterans such as herself and Evange-
line Bruce-~mingle with high liberal
politics and elevated social tone. You
might not prove a connection between
Anglophilia and the Georgetown Demo-
cratic establishment, because proving
such a thing would be vulgar and strenu-
ous. But you may nonetheless assume it
and not go far wrong. The embassy
helps set the pitch and rhythm, both for
those who don't say "Shall we join the
ladies?" and for those who do.
  This spring, the British ambassador
and his lady threw a little dinner dance
for Harriman. It wasn't too shabby, es-
pecially if you bore in mind that it was
to honor her being gazetted as ambassa-
dor designate to France. The Senate For-
eign Relations Committee hadn't yet had
the privilege of confirming Harriman,
and the French Embassy hadn't gotten
around to organizing its own f~~te, so the
British had managed to pre-empt both
the Congress and America's oldest ally.

Fred Hughes

Bellport, Long Island. Hughes asked him
to meet him at Warhol's house on East
66th Street, where they were joined by
Vincent Fremont, who had received the
news from Warhol's longtime physician,
Dr. Denton Cox. "It was like being
punched in the stomach and thrown out
the window," Fremont told me. Later that
afternoon, Warhol's brothers, Paul and
John Warhola, flew in from Pittsburgh.
  "One of the first things I did," Ed Hayes
(who is a contributing editor of this maga-
zine) told me, "was secure the incredible
warehouse of stuff Andy had accumulated
at his home, and in other places where he
kept things. Fred was afraid that when the
news got out lunatics and fans would try
to get into the house. So I arranged securi-
ty from the Major Case Squad. We had
probably the highest-quality security in
the Western world. I wanted guys I knew.
Homicide detectives."
  The following morning, Ed Hayes pre-
sented Fred Hughes with a two-page con-
tract appointing Hayes attorney for the
Warhol estate and stipulating that his fee
would be 2.5 percent of the estate's value.
(In April 1987, Hayes's fee was adjusted to
2 percent.) To date, Hayes has collected
$4.85 million for his own firm, and $6.7
million has been paid to other lawyers, in-
cluding Hayes's brother, Steve Hayes.
  "Look, my career was going very
well," Ed Hayes told me as he planted
perennials in the garden of the East Side
town house he bought after going to work
for the Warhol estate. "I was doing trial
work, I'd had some success as a real-es-
tate renovator, some substantial success,
right? And The Bonfire of the Vanities
was on every best-seller list. And I said to
Fred, `Look, you want me to basically de-
vote full time to this. It's a tremendous
risk for me, not just for the years I do it,
but for clients I could've gotten to go for-
ward.' And I said, `It has to be a once-in-
a-lifetime opportunity for me, too.'"
  I asked Fred Hughes why he hired Ed
Hayes. "That's very easy, Bob," Hughes
replied. "I didn't exactly hire Ed Hayes
on my own. Andy Warhol did. Then when
Andy died, horrendously, the lawyer that
I generally used and brought to the Fac-
tory in the first place-~it wasn't anybody
else who brought Robert Montgomery [of
Paul, Weiss, Rifkind], and he was recom-
mended to me by Jean de Menil-~was on
safari. So I desperately needed an attor-
ney, and I'd been working with Ed, and
Andy knew him-~he's in the Diarrheas."
Hughes was referring to The Andy Warhol


Diaries, which contains a reference to War-
hol's meeting Hayes at a party in 1980.
  "I was never aware of him being offi-
cially hired," Vincent Fremont said. "I
met Ed Hayes that morning, and I remem-
ber Fred asking me later, `What do you
think of Ed?' I didn't know what to think.
Fred was running the show as executor,
and it seemed O.K. And the decision to
let Paul, Weiss, Rifkind go was up to
him. I had no real say in it." Hughes told
me, "Ed Hayes acted like he needed an
education for art, so I figured he was one
person I could kind of trust. Mistake."
  For a while it seemed that Fred Hughes,
Ed Hayes, and Vincent Fremont were one
big happy family. Hughes spent many
weekends in Bellport, and when Susi
Hayes had a baby girl a few months after
Warhol's death, he was asked to be Avery's
godfather. The next two summers, Vincent
and Shelly Fremont rented a house on Shel-
ter Island with Hughes and his then constant
companion, Sarah Giles, Vanity Fair's Eu-
ropean editor, who later rented an apart-
ment in the Hayeses' town house. And as
executor of the Warhol estate, Hughes,
supported by Hayes and Fremont, went
from triumph to triumph.
  In April 1987, Hughes staged a grandi-
ose memorial service for Warhol at St.
Patrick's Cathedral, attended by more
than 2,000 people. In November 1987, he
signed a multimillion-dollar licensing deal
with Schlaifer Nance & Company, the
marketers of the Cabbage Patch Kids
dolls. In April 1988, Sotheby's conducted
a 10-day, six-catalogue auction of War-
hol's collectibles which brought in an as-
tounding $25.3 million. In May 1988,
210 Coca-Cola Bottles, an early-60s
painting, broke the million-dollar mark
for Warhol at auction when it was sold at
Sotheby's for $1.43 million. In August
1988, after a yearlong inventory super-
vised by Fremont, the Warhol estate was
appraised at $297 million, including $250
million in Warhol works. In November
1988, Marilyn Monroe 20 Times broke all
records for Warhol at auction, selling for
$3.9 million at Sotheby's. In December
1988, Sotheby's auctioned off a cache of
jewelry found under a filing cabinet in
Warhol's house for $1.64 million.
  In February 1989, the Museum of Mod-
ern Art, which had never had a Warhol
exhibition, opened a two-floor retrospec-
tive, which went on to Chicago, Paris,
London, Cologne, and Venice. In March
1989, the 800-page Andy Warhol Diaries
was published by Warner Books, which
had paid a $1.2 million advance. In May
1989, Interview was sold to newsprint
magnate Peter Brant for $12 million, after


a byzantine competition that involved S. I.
Newhouse, the late Malcolm Forbes, Jann
Wenner, and Ronald Perelman. That same
month, at Christie's, Warhol's auction
record was broken again when Shot Red
Marilyn hit $4.07 million. And in October
1989, the Warhol Foundation, along with
the Dia Foundation and the Carnegie In-
stitute, announced plans for an Andy
Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh.
  But things were not as rosy as they
seemed from the outside. I attended a
meeting at the Factory in late 1987, for
example, where the strain on Hughes, and
on his relationships with both Hayes and
Fremont, was already becoming notice-
able. In 1980, Broadway producer Lewis
Allen had taken an option, renewed every
year since then, on Warhol's Philosophy
and Exposures books, which I owned half
of as a ghostwriter on the former and co-
author on the latter. Allen planned to
adapt them for a multimedia musical star-
ring robots of Warhol and his dachshunds,
Archie and Amos. Hughes surprised Al-
len, Warhol's literary agent, Roz Cole,
and me by announcing that he was against
renewing the option again because, as he
said, "I don't control this project." When
Cole said that "a certain degree of trust"
had been established over the previous
seven years, Hughes stood up behind his
huge desk in his huge, all-red office and,
throwing his hands into the air, roared, "I
don't trust ANYONE!" Fremont sank into
his chair in embarrassment, but didn't say
a word. A few minutes later Hayes ar-
rived, and Hughes attacked him. "Where
were you?" he snapped. "When I tell you
to be someplace at 2:30, I expect you to
be there at 2:25. Got it?"
  It was only later that I learned that
Hughes had recently been diagnosed as
having a progressive form of multiple
sclerosis, a disease of the central nervous
system which need not reduce life expec-
tancy but which causes widely varying
symptoms that can range from blurred vi-
sion and slurred speech to complete paral-
ysis. During the 10-day Sotheby's auction
in April 1988, Hughes was sporting a sil-
ver-topped walking stick that seemed
more like an elegant accessory than a
physical aid. Less than a year later, at the
party for the opening of the MoMA retro-
spective, he was so dependent on his cane
that he spent most of the night sitting at a
table and waiting for people to come to
him. By November 1989, at the memorial
service at the Metropolitan Museum for
Diana Vreeland, his closest friend and
most important mentor after Dominique
de Menil, he was in a wheelchair.

publishing, about a high-level job at the illus-
trated weekly Paris-Match. Alex had listened
carefully to both offers, but in the end he was
not seriously tempted. Both he and Tatiana felt
committed to New York-~they never wanted to
live anywhere else-~and besides, in spite of his
mother's repeated jeremiads about wasting his
life, Alex was proud of the work he did for
Vogue. The other magazines, House & Garden
and Glamour, mattered much less to him; he
chose their covers and laid out each issue with
flair and inventiveness, but it was Vogue, the
flagship, the crown jewel of the Cond~~ Nast em-
pire, that occupied the major share of his at-
tention. Vogue had its own mission, which in
Alex's mind was to "involve women in the life
of the moment."
  He was proud of bringing serious art-~con-
temporary art included-~to the attention of
Vogue's readers. Although Alex sometimes wor-
ried that the magazine was simply paying lip
service to the fine arts, the truth was that Vogue
had become an important catalyst in the Amer-
ican public's postwar love affair with art. The
art features in Vogue never cheapened or trivi-
alized the subject, and their level of sophistica-
tion, thanks to Alex, was fairly high. Almost
every issue carried an essay by an important
critic: Harold  Rosenberg, Lawrence Alloway,
and Clement Greenberg were among the fre-
quent contributors. The critics, however, were
getting to be as competitively jealous as the
artists. Some years later, when Vogue published
a Penn portrait of Greenberg in its "People Are
Talking About" section, along with an admir-
ing note that called him "the American critic
best known around the world," Harold Rosen-
berg cut Alex dead on the street, wrote him an
angry letter, and then broke off all relations be-
tween them.
  Alex still clung to his own belief in the "no-
bility" of Vogue's civilizing mission. The word
cropped up whenever he was called on to write
something for or about Vogue-~an article on
beauty, a preface to a book of fashion pho-
tographs. In his mind, the concept of woman at
her best was a noble idea, to which Vogue gave
far more than lip service. He knew, of course,
that there was another side to this coin. The fe-
male image was being used more and more bla-
tantly to sell products of all kinds-~cars and dish-
washers and cigarettes as well as haute couture-~
and Vogue was coming to be looked upon in
some circles, along with other fashion journals,
as nothing more than a seductive environment
for advertising. Until the 1980s, however, Alex
was still able to see it as something more than
that. "In choosing a Vogue cover," he said. "I
never used to think, `Will it sell?' I honestly did
not. Our attitude in those days was that if some-
thing was right for Vogue, the readers would
have to like it." Although he always insisted that
layout was "not a creative process," he pushed
himself and his colleagues in the art department
to surpass themselves month after month, tear-
ing up completed layouts regardless of the cost,
turning what might have been resentment into
a spirit of shared adventure. "He would come


in the art department and rip everything up, but
you never felt he was destroying anything," said
Tina Fredericks, whom Alex made art director
of Glamour when she was only 23. "He was al-
ways positive. He raised your confidence level.
I felt he was my mentor, my father, my favorite
man in the whole world, and I think 100 other
women must have felt the same way."
  All his trips to the studios of major artists
had convinced him that he could not live their
sort of life, or endure the solitude that it re-
quired. Whenever a photographer talked about
doing "serious" work for Vogue, Alex would of-
fer the same advice. Treat Vogue as a commer-
cial job, he would say, and use the money to do
your serious work on the side. His own case,
however, was more complicated. Alex's work
for Vogue was as serious, and in some ways as
deeply committed, as the work he did on week-
ends in his studio. His mother had it wrong: He
needed both. ~

WORKING IT OUT
(Continued from page 222)
like shorter skirts (so women could walk), pock-
ets (to free the hands), and corsetless dresses
(that didn't require a husband to lace them)-~
as for the right to vote. None of the above be-
came a reality until the twenties, though, when
fun-loving flappers shortened their skirts and
their hair. Designers like Paul Poiret furthered
the cause by throwing out the corset-~a real
bone of contention among women who were
sick of suffering indigestion in the name of an
unnatural S-shaped silhouette known tellingly
as the kangaroo bend.
  The next hurdle was pants. Eyeing a sailor
on the Duke of Westminster's yacht in the mid-
1920s, Coco Chanel started making pants for
casual attire. They were deemed "amusingly
perverse," but more perverse was the fact that
Chanel had to wrap women in gold chains in or-
der to make her pants popular. Although dare-
devils like Amelia Earhart had a good excuse
to wear pants on the job, it took the blessing of
Hollywood-~and irreverent screen stars like
Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich, and, later,
Katharine Hepburn-~to prove that women
could be successful and sexy wearing pants.
  That was Hollywood, though. For the work-
ing girl next door, pants didn't become a reali-
ty until World War II, when women-~or "slacks
girls"-~went to work in the factories in cover-
alls and dungarees. Wartime clothes rationing
eliminated such luxuries as silk stockings, there-
by necessitating pants to cover the legs. De-
signers weren't immune to the strict rationing
orders of the day, either. Instead of focusing on
high fashion, they worked to adapt men's uni-
forms to women's needs. Mainbocher created


military-inspired suits for WAVES (Women Ac-
cepted for Volunteer Emergency Service), Lil-
ly Dach~~ fashioned factory bonnets out of util-
ity cloth, and Claire McCardell transformed
functional fabrics into her famous simple wrap,
the "popover dress."
  But when the GI's came home, Rosie the
Riveter slipped out of her overalls and back into
her girdle, hat, and gloves. Newsreels discour-
aged women from working, in the name of pa-
triotism. The higher standard of living in the
1950s, abetted by the first credit card and the
birth of a consumer society known as the mid-
dle-rich, pushed women back into constricting
dresses. Christian Dior had declared that
"clothes should be constructed like buildings,"
and Grace Kelly became the blueprint for a gen-
eration of women who aspired to fragility.
  It took a real cultural revolution (the sexual
one) and serious discontent (of the political
kind) to finally liberate women and get them
out of skirts and into pants-~in all kinds of cir-
cumstances, from the office to evenings out. So-
ciety columnist Eugenia Sheppard introduced
the career woman as fashion plate in 1967: "This
year .... the hard workers look incomparably
better than most of the wealthy women who
would settle for jewel-embroidered dresses ...
and let it go at that." By the mid-seventies,
women were joining the managerial work force
in record numbers. For lack of a better business
uniform, they adopted the man's suit with a
skirt. And uniform it was. Suddenly armies of
women were flooding offices with basic blue
suits, white blouses, and floppy bow ties. The
idea was to stop looking like women and start
looking like executives.
  Soon enough women realized that these
"confidence builders" didn't leave much room
for femininity or fashion. Sure, they wanted to
look legitimate in a man's world, but women
didn't necessarily want to look neutered.
Sportswear designers like Anne Klein and Liz
Claiborne came to the rescue with more casu-
al, career-oriented separates, but it was Gior-
gio Armani who managed to soften the actu-
al suit without taking the authority out of it.
Combining fluid fabrics with firm shoulder
pads, Armani came up with an answer to the 
men's business suit that endowed the wearer
with confidence instead of cookie-cutter uni-
formity. By the late seventies, the power suit
was born.
  "I was reacting to the consciousness of
women coming out of a long, hard, and much-
opposed feminist movement with their backs
broken," says Armani today of the power sil-
houette he sculpted over a decade ago. "They
were just breaking into the workplace and they
needed a stronger, more dignified image that
adhered to the rules of the man's uniform."
  By 1985, as working women confronted the
difficulties of "having it all," and the boring blue
suit became relegated to entry-level status, ex-
ecutive women started searching for a formu-
la-~a uniform of their own-~that didn't sacrifice
their power or their femininity. Donna Karan
responded with her sophisticated, sensual al-

say to yourself `I'm going to order
broiled fish' several times through-
out the day. By the time you get to
the restaurant, you'll do it," suggests
Dr. Shapiro.
~ Choose a place with healthy fare.
~ Order first so you won't consider
following someone else's fattening
suggestion.
~ Request that your food be pre-
pared the way it would at home-~low
in fat and calories. Have skin re-
moved from poultry, sauces served
on the side, and foods baked, grilled
or broiled rather than fried.
~ Fill up on rolls. Whole-wheat are
best, and skip the butter.
~ Indulge in broth soups and green
salads (ask for dressing on the side)
to take the edge off hunger.
~ Eat only two-thirds of what you're
served. This will cut food intake
"and you'll be in control," says Dr.
Norton Wyner of Los Angeles, whose
private practice specializes in a
mind/body approach to weight loss.
~ Have the dish taken away as soon
as you're satisfied to reduce the risk
of "picking" while others finish.
~ Order berries, frozen yogurt or
sherbet for dessert. If you really want
something more, consider splitting
an order. Eat only your half, though!

Party Willpower
~ Prepare for every social occasion
with a pep talk. Decide beforehand
to have just three hors d'oeuvres
and half a dessert, suggests Dr.
Wyner.
~ Make a list of the foods that will
cause problems, says Dr. Shapiro.
"Restrictive diets are too limited to
work outside the safe confines of
your kitchen. Learn to select healthy
choices that support long-term
goals and a normal lifestyle-~which
will inevitably include social events
beyond strict dietary limits, but not
beyond your control."
~ On days when you're going out to
dinner or to a party, build up fat and
calorie credits by eating smaller
breakfast and lunch portions.
~ Never arrive hungry. The Diet
Workshop estimates that 38 percent
of diet disasters occur on an empty
stomach. Have some whole-wheat

into the fund as soon as possible.
~ Invest in mutual funds. Although
emergency funds should be kept liquid in
a bank, credit union or money-market
mutual fund, other savings should be in-
vested for a higher yield. Ungar suggests
growth stock funds for college savings.
They carry a higher risk than some mutual
funds, but have returned an average of 17
percent a year over five years. If Renae
and Pablo hold their shares for at least 10
years-~until Leanne starts college-~Ungar
says, "The risk would be somewhat miti-
gated." His advice: Buy only funds rated
four or five stars by Morningstar, the mu-
tual-fund rating service.
  Sharkey agrees, suggesting such no-
load mutual funds as Janus Fund, Neu-
berger & Berman Guardian or Partners
funds, and Financial Industrial Income
Fund.
~ Make regular investments, re-
gardless of share prices. If you put a
set amount into a mutual fund every
month, you'll get more shares when prices
are low. This reduces your average cost
per share, producing what's known as
dollar-cost averaging. Starting small and
dollar-cost averaging, says Sharkey,
should ease Pablo's fear of investing.
~ Restructure Pablo's life insur-


ance. With two young children and an
unemployed wife, Pablo needs more life
insurance than the $100,000 he carries.
Medley favors $300,000 of term life. Un-
gar suggests $500,000 of level term-~
enough to pay off the Florida mortgage
and provide income for Renae and the
children. With careful shopping, he says,
Pablo should be able to buy the coverage
for $425 a year.
~ Explore tax-sheltered saving
plans. The experts urge Pablo to contrib-
ute to the 401(k) tax-deferred savings
plan at work as soon as possible. This
should come before starting an IRA be-
cause most employers match contribu-
tions to a 401(k) plan-~and those contri-
butions are not subject to current income
or Social Security taxes.
~ Put the Florida house on the back
burner. "Wait out the housing cycle,"
says Medley. "Time-~and not a lot of it-~
may solve the problem." Even though the
Arayas have a small net loss from renting
the place, they do get tax advantages from
home ownership. If being landlords
proves emotionally wearing, they could
sell at a loss and borrow what's needed to
pay off the mortgage. The one thing they
should not do is abandon the Florida
home, even though they have little equity

  TEC provides its nearly 3,000 mem-
bers, most of whom work in the U.S.,
with access to other bosses just like them,
all grappling with the same problems. And
at an annual fee of $8,400, it's far less
expensive than the typical $1,000-a-day
rate for private consultants. Aside from
the meetings, executives also have the ben-
efit of monthly one-on-one consultations
with group leaders. Membership has in-
creased tenfold over the past decade; still,
just 142 members are women.
  Barbara Ainley, CEO of L.A. Studios,
a $7-million-a-year company that pro-
duces sound effects for commercials,
says her TEC group helped her restruc-
ture her business. A year ago, her man-
agers simply were not getting the job
done. "Nobody was taking responsibili-
ty," she says. "Everything was being
dumped in my lap." Ainley could have
fired the lot, but her group convinced
her that it would be better to train them
instead. She linked compensation to stu-
dio hours billed, instituted a system that
ties management bonuses to specific per-
formance goals and started an annual em-
ployee survey in which management is
graded-~all to good effect. "You might
call it business therapy," she concedes.
"But even if there's nothing wrong with
your company, there's always a way to
do things better."	-~Elliot Pinsley

making process, either in small teams or
individually," says Jeanette Headrick, a 51-
year-old who joined Collins ~ Aikman six
years ago, just when the troubles had come
to a head. Headrick, now coordinator of the
carpet-installation department, gives credit
for the company's success to the empow-
erment-training program facilitated by
Pecos River Learning Centers of Santa Fe,
N.M., and Executive Quality Management
of Spartanburg, S.C. During the two-day
program, Headrick and her colleagues par-
ticipated in a series of exercises, such as
scaling a 42-foot wall in groups of three
linked together with rope, much as their
fates within the company would be linked.
Teammates on the ground held belay ropes
and told their climbers where to place their
feet and hands. For Headrick, a perfec-
tionist, the wall was a Waterloo: "I had to
make a decision, after talking to my team-
mates, that I was not able to climb the wall.
They had to come down with me, so it kept
them from climbing it, too." In the end, she
says, she and her teammates learned how
to work much more harmoniously. "Every-
one has their own wall, and you learn to be
more tolerant," she explains.
  As a result of programs like this one,
floor-coverings-division employees have,
over the last two years, suggested over
1,800 ways to change procedures, pro-
cesses and products. Roughly 75 percent
of their ideas have been adopted. One
team of employees reduced the waste
from cutting carpet into tiles by 90 per-
cent. All facets of quality have improved.
The division has won four awards for
excellence in design from the Institute of
Business Designers.
  Morale has also improved. Employee
turnover fell from 27 percent in 1989 to 14
percent last year. And absenteeism
declined from 3.4 to 2 percent, the indus-
try average, in spite of the fact that
employees are encouraged to take time off
when they need it, rather than penalized
for missing work.
  Unlike Collins ~ Aikman Textile
Group, spurred by crisis, the Taylor group
of companies moved to participative man-
agement out of foresight. James Taylor,
president and CEO, and his brother John,
treasurer, are third-generation managers
of the boat-accessories subsidiary, Nelson
A. Taylor, based in Gloversville, N.Y., that
their grandfather started in 1908. The par-
ent company employs over 500 people in
six plants scattered about the U.S., Ireland


and Canada. During the mid-'80s, the sub-
sidiary, an industry leader best known for
windshields and window glass, was riding
the wave of strong growth that was sweep-
ing the marine industry. That was making
the Taylors nervous. "We had managed the
company as a benevolent dictatorship,"
says James. "But I started to realize that the
old way of doing things just wasn't going
to work in the future." His search for new
ideas came to an end when he discovered
Stayer's Harvard Business Review article.
  The Taylors have been working on
changing their company for almost three
years now, and they both feel strongly
that they have done the right thing. But
every step has been painful, and the
brothers agree: "You can't let your ego


get in the way," says 49-year-old James,
whose tone lets you know he has tripped
over his own ego more times than he
cares to count."You have to change your-
self," says John, 42. "The organization is
only a reflection of the people. So if all
the people believe in top-down manage-
ment, the organization is top-down." Like
Eitel, the Taylors learned early on that
empowerment cannot coexist with fear.
James realized he would have to learn to
shut up when he heard, during an early
self-management meeting, that some of his
people had coined the word "Jimidation."
  Initially, it was as hard for the workers
to take responsibility as it was for the Tay-
lors to relinquish it. "The first team we ever
formed was one to come up with new work
rules," says James. After a few weeks, sev-
eral workers told him to write the rules him-
self. All that's changing now. Workers at
each plant have written new rules for work
and compensation, and some teams even do
the hiring. The human-resources depart-
ment supports them by administering ben-
efits and assisting in locating candidates to
hire. And the managers have become coach-
es. Says John, "One job is to outline certain
legal and ethical parameters things have to
be within, and to measure everything we
do against the needs of our customers."
  Without empowerment, says James,
Nelson A. Taylor would very likely have
sunk last year, when the industry's rev-
enues fell by nearly half from '89. But the
company rode out the storm.

CAR WARS  The most widely noted
American empowerment success is also at
one of the biggest companies that adhere
to this ideology-~General Motors. Not
long ago, few experts would have predict-
ed that an all-new American car could
have matched the reliability of Toyotas
and Hondas. But for the second year in a
row, GM's Saturn has done just that,
according to the current annual auto issue
of Consumer Reports.
  Some credit must go to the Saturn
plant's managers, who from the start
were determined to build the best Amer-
ican car ever. But credit must go also to
workers-~and empowerment. Mercedes
Benz's 300 and 190 series, veritable
tapestries of fine engineering, are signif-
icantly less reliable than Saturn, says
Consumer Reports. But then, Daimler-
Benz, the manufacturer, is not perceived
to be as empowered or as lean as Saturn.
