poor economy. In the North American market, automotive
and truck brakes, safety restraints, aftermarket products and
turbochargers had substantial earnings growth. Productivity
improvements and higher sales volumes substantially reduced
prior year losses in Brazil. The 1993 results include an after-
tax charge of $3 million reflecting the current year's impact of
adopting FASB No. 112.
  The Company introduced new ABS products in Europe and 
the U.S. in 1993 which strengthened its position in braking
systems for new vehicle production. Although its market share
remains less than 10 percent, the Company is developing
more advanced technology that should strengthen its competi-
tive position by 1996.
  Increased competitive activity across all product lines and
increasing product and cost demands from customers will
continue to put pressure on the Company's automotive busi-
ness. However, the Company believes it will more than offset
these market conditions through product innovation, aggres-
sive productivity actions to reduce costs and by accelerating
the process of supplying integrated automotive systems to the
global marketplace. To improve operating efficiencies, the
Company initiated plans in 1991 and 1992 to significantly 
reduce the number of its worldwide locations. By the end of
1993, 20 operating plants had been closed. Sales offices, distri-
bution centers and research and development facilities are
also being consolidated.


  Engineered Materials had a 7 percent sales increase. Sales
of fluorine products, including environmentally-safer substi-
tutes for CFCs, grew substantially and sales of laminate sys-
tems, oximes, performance additives and tar products were
materially higher. Sales of carpet and industrial fibers also
improved, but sales of intermediate chemicals and environ-
mental catalysts were lower because of weak market
conditions.
  Engineered Materials' adjusted net income was significantly
higher in 1993 because of strong productivity gains and
improved revenues for fluorine products, industrial fibers, per-
formance additives and tar products. Results also improved for
UOP. Partially offsetting these gains were higher operating
costs for laminate systems, reduced demand for intermediate
chemicals and lower earnings for Paxon. 1993 results include
an after-tax charge of $2 million reflecting the current year's
impact of adopting FASB No. 112.
  Regarding environmental matters, the Company is
subject to various federal, state and local requirements relating
to the protection of the environment. The Company believes
that, as a general matter, its policies, practices and procedures
are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environ-
mental damage and that its handling, manufacture, use and
disposal of hazardous or toxic substances are in accord with
environmental laws and regulations. However, mainly because
of past operations and operations of predecessor companies,
the Company is a party to lawsuits and claims and has
incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs asso-
ciated with environmental matters. Additional lawsuits, claims
and costs involving environmental matters are likely to con-
tinue to arise in the future. The Company continually con-
ducts studies, individually at Company-owned sites, and jointly


(1) Amounts are net of repurchases.


  The only material financial instruments which are not car-
ried in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at amounts which
approximate fair values are certain debt instruments. The car-
rying value of long-term debt and related current maturities
(excluding capitalized lease obligations), is $1,687 and $1,906
million and the fair value is $1,945 and $2,100 million at
December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The fair value of
the long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market
price for the issues (if traded) or based on the current rates
offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining
maturity and characteristics.
  The Company entered into two new credit agreements (3
Year and 364 Day Credit Agreements) dated July 7, 1993, with
commitments aggregating $900 million, with a group of 21
banks. These agreements replaced a $1.11 billion arrange-
ment. The funds available under the Credit Agreements may
be used for any corporate purpose.  Loans under the $450
million 3 Year Credit Agreement are required to be repaid no
later than July 7, 1996.  Annually, the Company may request
that the maturity of the 3 Year Credit Agreement be extended
by another year.  The Company intends to request an exten-
sion of the agreement in 1994.  The banks' commitments to
lend under the $450 million 364 Day Credit Agreement termi-
nate on July 5, 1994 and any loans then outstanding will be
converted to term loans maturing on July 5, 1995. The Com-
pany intends to renegotiate this agreement in 1994. The Com-
pany has agreed to pay facility fees of .10 percent per annum
and .15 percent per annum on the aggregate commitments
for the 364 Day and 3 Year Credit Agreements, respectively,
subject to increase or decrease in the event of changes in the
Company's long-term debt ratings.  The Credit Agreements do
not contain restrictions on the Company's ability to pay divi-
dends or requirements that the Company maintain a specific
net worth.  They do contain other customary conditions and
events of default, the failure to comply with, or occurrence of
which, would prevent any further borrowings and would gen-
erally require the settlement of any outstanding borrowings
under either Credit Agreement.  Such conditions include the 
absence of any material adverse change in the ability of the
Company to pay its indebtedness when due, and such events
of default include (a) non-payment of Credit Agreement debt
and interest thereon, (b) non-compliance with the terms of
the covenants, (c) cross-default with other debt in certain
circumstances, (d) bankruptcy and (e) defaults upon obliga-
tions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.
  Interest on borrowings under the Credit Agreements would
be determined, at the Company's option, by (a) an auction
bidding procedure; (b) the highest of the average floating
base rate of two reference banks, one-half percent above the
average CD rate, or one-half percent above the Federal funds
rate; or (c) .225 and .275 percent for the 3 Year and 364 Day


Credit Agreements, respectively, and if either Credit Agree-
ment is drawn down in excess of 50 percent of its total
amount, .2875 and .3375 percent for the 3 Year and 364 Day
Credit Agreements, respectively, over the average LIBOR or
CD rate of three reference banks.  The spreads over the LIBOR
or CD rates are subject to increase or decrease if the Com-
pany's long-term debt ratings change.  The Company had no
balance outstanding under the Credit Agreements at Decem-
ber 31, 1993. They have also served as support for the issu-
ance of commercial paper and certain notes under the Com-
pany's Employee Stock Ownership funding program.  At
December 31, 1993 the Company had outstanding $164 mil-
lion of commercial paper and $259 million of notes sup-
ported by the Credit Agreements.

Note 15. Lease Commitments

Future minimum lease payments under operating leases hav-
ing initial or remaining noncancellable lease terms in excess
of one year are as follows:


  Our chemical earnings improved significantly to $240
million due to continuing cost-cutting, aggressive manage-
ment of our portfolio of assets and the focusing of our busi-
nesses around five strategies.

  Earnings were restrained, however, by the performance
of our olefins and polymers operations.  These operations are
closely tied to the general business cycle and have been in
the down-phase for the last several years.

  We strengthened our position as the world's leading pro-
ducer of purified terephthalic acid (PTA), the preferred raw
material for polyester, by starting expansions at our joint-
venture plants in Asia and by securing a license to build a
world-scale plant in Malaysia.

  Our overall goal is to be the preferred supplier of all our
customers.  We rely on a thorough knowledge of customers'
needs, effective customer service systems, responsiveness
and a proven ability to meet all requirements.

STRATEGIC DIRECTION

Optimize our existing operations

  Optimizing operations means getting the most from
existing assets and divesting those that do not offer an
acceptable return on investment.  Our goal is to direct re-
sources where profitable opportunities fit our capabilities.

  We streamlined by selling assets that did not fit our
strategic goals.  These included Welchem Inc., which makes
oil field production and process chemicals; a Canadian
fibers and yarn plant and a polystyrene plant in California.

  We have programs to yield the most from our assets.
These include eliminating work processes that do not
add value, optimizing use of computers and other
information-related technology and benchmarking our
accounting operations to the best practices of our industry.

STRATEGIC DIRECTION

Globally expand our core businesses

  Our most important commodity chemical, with annual
revenues of about $1 billion, is PTA, the preferred raw mate-
rial for making polyester.  The largest single use for polyester

1993 vs. 1992

  Consolidated net income for 1993 amounted to $1,820
million, compared with a loss of $74 million incurred in
1992.  Excluding the cumulative effects of adoption in 1992
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.
106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions," and SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes," 1992 earnings were $850 million.  Net in-
come in 1991 was $1,484 million, which included the cumu-
lative benefit of $311 million associated with the adoption
in 1991 of SFAS No. 96, "Accounting for Income Taxes."

  Year-to-year comparisons in net income were affected by
various items, summarized in the table below:


  Favorably affecting 1993 net income were gains of $190
million associated with the disposition of certain Canadian
properties and investments, and tax benefits of $113 million.
Adversely affecting 1993 results were charges of $170 mil-
lion associated with the writedown of Congo exploration
and production operations to current recoverable value and
additional deferred taxes of $53 million due to the effect of a
tax rate change resulting from enactment of the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.  Included in 1992 results
were charges of $805 million associated with a strategic
reassessment of business operations.  Partially offsetting
were benefits of $90 million related to natural gas contract
settlements and $90 million associated with revised esti-
mates of tax obligations and retirement of debt.


During the year ended December 31, 1993, the corporation
reduced certain inventory quantities which were valued at
lower LIFO costs prevailing in prior years.  The effect of this
reduction was to increase net income by approximately $50
million.  A smaller LIFO gain was included in 1992.

Inventories carried under the LIFO method represented ap-
proximately 47 percent of total year-end inventory carrying
values in 1993 and 48 percent in 1992.  It is estimated that
inventories would have been approximately $900 million
higher than reported on December 31, 1993, and approxi-
mately $1.3 billion higher on December 31, 1992, if the quan-
tities valued on the LIFO basis were instead valued on the
FIFO basis.

5.  Amoco Credit Corporation
Amoco Credit Corporation (Credit) is a wholly owned
finance subsidiary of the corporation.  Credit is primarily
engaged in the business of financing certain accounts and
notes receivable of the corporation through the issuance
of commercial paper and other short-term borrowings.  The
financial information of Credit included in the consolidated
financial statements is provided in the following table:


7. Short-Term Obligations
Amoco's short-term obligations consist of notes payable and
commercial paper. Notes payable as of December 31, 1993,
totaled $71 million at an average annual interest rate of 3.2
percent, compared with $75 million at an average annual
interest rate of 3.6 percent at year-end 1992.  Commercial
paper borrowings at December 31, 1993, were $936 million
at an average annual interest rate of 3.4 percent compared
with $143 million at an average annual interest rate of 3.5
percent as of December 31, 1992.  The carrying value of
short-term obligations as of December 31, 1993 and Decem-
ber 31, 1992, approximated estimated fair value.

Bank lines of credit available to support commercial paper
borrowings of the corporation amounted to $490 million and
$500 million at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
All of these were supported by commitment fees.

The corporation also maintains compensating balances
with a number of banks for various purposes.  Such arrange-
ments do not legally restrict withdrawal or usage of avail-
able cash funds.  In the aggregate, they are not material in
relation to total liquid assets.

8.  Accounts Payable
Accounts payable at December 31, 1993 and 1992, included
liabilities in the amount of $304 million and $342 million, re-
spectively, for checks issued in excess of related bank bal-
ances but not yet presented for collection.

9. Long-Term Debt
Amoco's long-term debt resides principally with two Amoco
subsidiaries-~Amoco Company and Amoco Canada.  Amoco
Company functions as the principal holding company for
all of Amoco's petroleum and chemical operations, except
Canadian petroleum operations and selected other
activities.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Operations and Financial Condition

INTRODUCTION

  This discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operat-
ing results, financial condition and liquidity/cash flows of Anheuser-Busch
Companies, Inc. during the three-year period ended December 31, 1993.  This dis-
cussion should be read in conjunction with the Letter to Shareholders, financial
statements and financial statement footnotes included in this annual report.
   Two unusual occurrences had negative impacts on the company's 1993 earnings.  In
September 1993, the company announced a Profitability Enhancement Program which
includes significant organizational and operational changes to improve sales and prof-
itability.  The Program includes the following elements:
  ~ An enhanced retirement program for salaried employees
  ~ The write-down of underperforming assets and investments
  ~ The restructuring and reorganization of the company
  This Program is expected to generate cost savings of more than $100 million in 1994
and $400 million a year by 1997.
  The restructuring and reorganization element of the Program includes the following ini-
tiatives designed to increase efficiencies and reduce operating costs:
  ~ Brewery modernization programs based on the successful practices employed at the com-
    pany's newer breweries.  Such programs include increased employee involvement to
    improve quality and efficiency throughout the entire 13-brewery system.
  ~ Relocation of the company's food products operations to St. Louis.  Additionally, bakery
    facilities will be modernized and consolidated.
  The Program is also designed to improve sales of the company's premium beer prod-
ucts through aggressive advertising and the introduction of new products.  The company's
newest product, Ice Draft from Budweiser, was rolled out nationwide in January 1994.
  As a result of the Program, the company recognized a $565 million ($1.26 per share)
restructuring charge during the third quarter 1993.  Further information concerning the details
of the restructuring charge is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
  Additionally, the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993, signed into law during the third
quarter 1993, increased the corporate federal statutory income tax rate by one percent-
age point retroactive to January 1, 1993.  This retroactive income tax rate increase resulted
in a $33 million, or $.12 per share, non-recurring after-tax, non-cash charge related to
revaluation of the deferred tax liability in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard
No. 109 (FAS 109)-~Accounting for Income Taxes.
  The non-recurring restructuring charge and the non-recurring deferred tax revaluation
charge distort comparability of 1993 and 1992 reported financial results.  To facilitate evaluation
and understanding of the company's 1993 financial results, key financial comparisons affected
by these charges are disclosed in this discussion both including and excluding the charges.
  Earnings for 1992 were impacted by the adoption of new accounting principles.
Effective January 1, 1992 as discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, the company adopted the financial accounting standards for postretirement
benefits (FAS 106) and income taxes (FAS 109).  The company elected to immediately rec-
ognize the cumulative effect of adoption of FAS 106/109 pertaining to years prior to
1992 through a one-time cumulative effect adjustment which decreased 1992 net
income and earnings per share by $76.7 million and $.26, respectively.  These amounts
are separately identified in the company's consolidated 1992 income statement.
  Implementation of FAS 106 in 1992 was based on benefit levels in effect at the time of adop-
tion.  Certain changes to these benefit levels were implemented in 1993, thereby reducing the
FAS 106 pretax expense amount in 1993 as compared to 1992 by $27.0 million to $48.3 million.

Results of Operations

Revenues

Operating revenues for 1993 were $25.4 billion compared
to $30.2 billion and $29.3 billion for 1992 and 1991.
Commercial aircraft products and services accounted for
81%, 80% and 78% of total operating revenues for the
years 1993, 1992 and 1991. The Company's commercial
jet transport market share was approximately 60% in terms
of sales value for each of the three years.

Commercial jet transport deliveries by model:


 Commercial production rates were at 32~~~ aircraft per
month at the beginning of 1993 and ended the year at 23
per month. In early 1994, the 747 production rate was
reduced from 5 to 3 per month. Based on current produc-
tion schedules, the 737 rate will be reduced from 10 to 8~~~
per month in the fourth quarter of 1994, the 757 rate will
be reduced from 5 to 4 per month in the first quarter of
1995, the 767 rate will be increased from 3 to 4 per month
in the first quarter of 1995, and the 747 rate will be re-
duced from 3 to 2 per month in January 1995. Planned
production rates will continue to be adjusted as necessary
to match customer orders. Production of the new 777
model is on schedule to support the flight test program
starting in mid-1994, and production activity will continue
to build until initial deliveries begin in mid-1995. Com-
mercial jet transport deliveries for 1994 are currently
projected to be in the 260 range. Commercial transporta-
tion sales trends are discussed further in the Commercial
Aircraft Market Environment section on pages 29-32.


  The Company continues to be subject to ongoing U.S.
Government investigations of business practices and cost
classifications. These proceedings could involve claims by
the Government for damages, and under certain circum-
stances a contractor can be suspended or debarred from
Government contracts.  The Company believes, based upon
all available information, that the outcome of the Govern-
ment investigations will not have a materially adverse
effect on its financial position or results of operations.

  The Company is subject to federal and state require-
ments for protection of the environment, including those
for discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of
contaminated sites.  Due in part to their complexity and
pervasiveness, such requirements have resulted in the
Company being involved with related legal proceedings,
claims and remediation obligations over the past 10 years.
The costs incurred and expected to be incurred in connec-
tion with such activities have not had, and are not expected
to have, a material impact to the Company's financial
position.  With respect to results of operations, related
charges have averaged less than 2% of annual net earnings,
and have not exceeded 3~~~% in any given year.

  The Company routinely assesses, based on in-depth
studies, expert analyses and legal reviews, its contingencies,
obligations and commitments to clean up sites, including
assessments of the probability of recoveries from other
responsible parties who have and have not agreed to a 
settlement and recoveries from insurance carriers.  The
Company's policy is to immediately recognize identified
exposures related to environmental cleanup sites based on
conservative estimates of investigation, cleanup, and
monitoring costs to be incurred.

  Based on all known facts and expert analyses, the Com-
pany believes it is not reasonably likely that identified
environmental contingencies will result in a materially
adverse impact to the Company's financial position or
operating results and cash flow trends.


  In January 1991, the Company received from the U.S.
Government a notice of partial termination for default
which terminated most of the work required under con-
tracts to develop and install a new air defense system for
Saudi Arabia, known as the Peace Shield program.  The
Government has filed with the Company a demand for
repayment of $605 of Peace Shield unliquidated progress
payments plus interest commencing January 25, 1991. In
February 1991, the Company submitted a request for a
deferred payment agreement which, if granted, would
formally defer the Company's potential obligation to repay
the $605 of unliquidated progress payments until the
conclusion of the appeal process.  In June 1991, the Gov-
ernment selected another contractor to perform the work
which is the subject of the contracts that have been termi-
nated for default, and the Government will likely assert
claims related to the reprocurement.  The Company does
not expect the Government to assert such claims prior to
completion of the reprocurement contract, which was
originally scheduled for late 1995.
  Management's position, supported by outside legal
counsel which specializes in government procurement law,
is that the grounds for default asserted by the Government
in the Peace Shield termination are not legally support-
able.  Accordingly, management and counsel are of the
opinion that on appeal the termination for default has a
substantial probability of being converted to termination
for the convenience of the Government, which would
eliminate any Government claim for cost of reprocurement
or other damages.  Additionally, the Company has a legal
basis for a claim for equitable adjustment to the prices and
schedules of the contracts (the "Contract Claim").  Many
of the same facts underlie both the Contract Claim and
the Company's appeal of the Government's termination
action.  The Company has filed its complaint in the United
States Claims Court to overturn the default termination in
order to obtain payment of the Contract Claim.  The parties


are currently litigating jurisdictional issues related to the
complaint, and are engaged in discovery.  Trial is currently
scheduled for March 1997.  The Company expects that its
position will ultimately be upheld with respect to the
termination action and that it will prevail on the Contract
Claim.

  The Company's financial statements have been pre-
pared on the basis of a conservative estimate of the revised
values of the Peace Shield contracts including the Contract
Claim and the Company's position that the termination
was for the convenience of the Government.  At this time,
the Company cannot reasonably estimate the length of 
time that will be required to resolve the termination appeal
and the Contract Claim.  In the event that the Company's
appeal of the termination for default is not successful, the
Company could realize a pre-tax loss on the program
approximating the value of the unliquidated progress
payments plus related interest and potential damages
assessed by the Government.

  The Company is subject to several U.S. Government
investigations of business and cost classification practices.
One investigation involves a grand jury proceeding as to
whether or not certain costs were charged to the proper
overhead accounts.  No charges have been filed in this
matter, and based on the facts known to it, the Company
believes it would have defenses if any were filed.  The
investigations could result in civil, criminal or administra-
tive proceedings.  Such proceedings, if any, could involve
claims by the Government for fines, penalties, compensa-
tory and treble damages, restitution and/or forfeitures.
Based upon Government procurement regulations, a
contractor, or one or more of its operating divisions or
subdivisions, can also be suspended or debarred from
Government contracts if proceedings result from the
investigations.  The Company believes, based upon all
available information, that the outcome of Government
investigations will not have a materially adverse effect on
its financial position or results of operations.

Financial Statements  The following financial statements and notes have been condensed
to make them more readable.  More detailed financial information is provided in the appendix to the proxy state-
ment. Where applicable, financial information has been grouped as follows:

Consolidated  The consolidated data of Caterpillar Inc. and all its subsidiaries.

Machinery and Engines Company operations, excluding the Financial Products subsidiaries;
consists primarily of the company's manufacturing, marketing, and parts distribution operations.

Financial Products  The company's finance and insurance subsidiaries, primarily Caterpillar
Financial Services Corporation and Caterpillar Insurance Co. Ltd.


Report of Management  The management of Caterpillar Inc. has prepared the accom-
panying condensed consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992, and is
responsible for their integrity and objectivity.  Management maintains a system of internal accounting controls
which is designed to provide reasonable assurance that, among other things, transactions are properly executed and
financial records and reports are reliable.  Through its Audit Committee, the board of directors reviews the
company's financial and accounting policies, practices, and reports.  The complete Report of Management appears
in the appendix to the proxy statement for the 1994 annual meeting of the stockholders of Caterpillar Inc.


the West, Southwest and South.  At year-
end, Chevron had 2,415 company-owned
or -leased service stations, down from ap-
proximately 3,400 in 1988.  Branded outlets
that sell Chevron gasoline have declined by
about 2,600 to 5,925.  In the same 1988 to
1993 period, the sales volume of Chevron
gasoline increased 5 percent.

Stations cut costs, speed service.

Computer technology is cutting credit
card operating costs, increasing employee
productivity and reducing overhead.  For
example, about 1,300 Chevron stations -~
up from 900 in 1992 -~ now offer Fast Pay.
This is part of an automated, satellite-
linked system that approves transactions
in approximately five seconds and allows
customers to pay at the pump, without the
need for an attendant.  The system reduces
potential losses from fraud, speeds payment
to Chevron and helps station operators
better manage their businesses.

Consumers give Chevron high rating.

An independent survey of gasoline buyers
asked if they were "very satisfied" with
their last purchase, would definitely buy
that brand again and would recommend it
to others.  Chevron's rating was 25 percent
higher than the industry average.   The sur-
vey showed that customers appreciate
Chevron's consistency of service, product
performance, station cleanliness, personal
attention and competitive prices.

Research supports refining and prod-
uct advances.  Chevron Research and
Technology Company (CRTC) provides
services to other Chevron operating com-
panies throughout the world.  CRTC has
improved refining processes and devel-


International products business now
markets technology.  Chevron Interna-
tional Oil Company (CIOC) is primarily
involved in international crude and prod-
ucts sales and trading.  It also now manages
a growth market for Chevron's proprietary
technologies for fuels, lubricants and cata-
lysts.  In 1993, a number of these technol-
ogies were licensed for projects in Japan,
Taiwan, Malaysia, Korea and Canada, as
well as in the United States.  In early 1994,
CIOC agreed to license technology and
provide engineering services for a major
refinery-modification project near St.
Petersburg, Russia.


MBPD=Thousands of barrels per day


	Chevron has significant oil and gas exploration and production operations in Nigeria and in the
Angolan exclave of Cabinda, where its share of net production is about 100,000 barrels of crude oil
per day from each of these countries.  Angola has experienced civil unrest following its 1992 elections;
separately, elements seeking independence of Cabinda from Angola have periodically created civil
unrest in the area of the company's operations.  Also, the nullification of the Nigerian elections in
1993 has been followed by a period of political uncertainty.  To date, none of these events has had a
significant impact on the company's operations, but the company is closely monitoring developments.

Environmental matters.  Virtually all aspects of the businesses in which the company engages
are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.
These regulatory requirements continue to increase in both number and complexity and govern not
only the manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells.  Most of
the costs of complying with myriad laws and regulations pertaining to its operations and products are
embedded in the normal costs of conducting its business.  Using definitions and guidelines estab-
lished by the American Petroleum Institute, Chevron estimates its worldwide environmental spend-
ing in 1993 was nearly $1.5 billion, of which $675 million were capital expenditures.  These amounts
do not include non-cash provisions recorded for environmental remediation programs, but include
spending charged against such reserves.
	In addition to the various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing
its ongoing operations and products, the company (as well as other companies engaged in the petro-
leum or chemicals industries) is required to incur expenses for corrective actions at various facilities
and waste disposal sites.  An obligation to take remedial action may be incurred as a result of the enact-
ment  of laws, such as the federal Superfund law, or the issuance of new regulations or as the result of
accidental leaks and spills in the ordinary course of business.  In addition, an obligation may arise when
a facility is closed or sold.  Most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to facilities and
sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable under
regulations existing at the time performed, but now will require investigatory and/or remedial work
to ensure adequate protection to the environment.
	During 1993, the company recorded $215 million of before-tax provisions to provide for envi-
ronmental remediation efforts, including Superfund sites.  Actual expenditures charged against these
provisions and other previously established reserves amounted to $183 million in 1993.  At year-end
1993, the company's environmental remediation reserve was $746 million, including $56 million
related to Superfund sites.  Receivables of $18 million have been recorded for expected reimburse-
ments of expenditures for environmental cleanup.
	Under provisions of the Superfund law, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as well as
certain state agencies, have designated Chevron a potentially responsible party (PRP) for remediation
of a portion of 223 hazardous waste sites.  At year-end 1993, the company's cumulative share of costs
and settlements for approximately 145 of these sites, for which payments or provisions have been
made in 1993 and prior years, was about $89 million, including a provision of $6 million during 1993.
For the remaining sites, investigations are not yet at a stage where the company is able to quantify a
probable liability or determine a range of possible exposure.  The Superfund law provides for joint
and several liability.  Any future actions by the EPA and other regulatory agencies to require Chevron
to assume other responsible parties' costs at designated hazardous waste sites are not expected to have
a material effect on the company's consolidated financial position or liquidity.
	Provisions are recorded for work at identified sites where an assessment or remediation plan has
been developed and for which costs can reasonably be estimated.  It is likely the company will con-
tinue to incur additional charges for environmental programs relating to past operations.  These
future costs are indeterminable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contam-
ination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the deter-
mination of the company's liability in proportion to other responsible parties and the extent to which
such costs are recoverable from insurance or other sources.  While the amounts of future costs may be
material to the company's results of operations in the period in which they are recognized, the com-
pany does not expect these costs to have a material effect on Chevron's consolidated financial position
or liquidity.  Also, the company does not believe its obligations to make such expenditures have had or
will have any significant impact on the company's competitive position relative to other domestic or


responsibility includes maintaining the integrity and objectivity of financial data and the presentation of
Chrysler's results of operations and financial position in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.  The financial statements include amounts that are based on management's best estimates
and judgments.
	Chrysler's financial statements have been audited by Deloitte & Touche, independent auditors.
Their audits were conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and included
consideration of the internal control system and tests of transactions as part of planning and per-
forming their audits.
	Chrysler maintains a system of internal controls that provides reasonable assurance that its
records reflect its transactions in all material respects and that significant misuse or loss of assets will
be prevented.  Management believes the system of internal controls is adequate to accomplish these
objectives on a continuous basis.  Chrysler maintains a strong internal auditing program that indepen-
dently assesses the effectiveness of the internal controls and recommends possible improvements.
Management considers the General Auditor's and Deloitte & Touche's recommendations concerning
the system of internal controls and takes appropriate actions to respond to these recommendations.
	The Board of Directors, acting through its Audit Committee composed solely of nonemployee
directors, is responsible for determining that management fulfills its responsibilities in the preparation
of financial statements and the maintenance of internal controls.  In fulfilling its responsibility, the Audit
Committee recommends independent auditors to the Board of Directors for appointment by the
shareholders.  The Committee also reviews the consolidated financial statements and adequacy of
internal controls.  The Audit Committee meets regularly with management, the General Auditor and
the independent auditors.  Both the independent auditors and the General Auditor have full and free
access to the Audit Committee, without management representatives present, to discuss the scope
and results of their audits and their views on the adequacy of internal controls and the quality of
financial reporting.
	It is the business philosophy of Chrysler Corporation and its subsidiaries to obey the law and to
require that its employees conduct their activities according to the highest standards of business
ethics.  Management reinforces this philosophy by numerous actions, including issuing a Code of
Ethical Behavior and maintaining a Business Practices Committee and a Business Practices Office to
support compliance with the Corporation's policies.


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Chrysler Corporation and consolidated
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related consolidated statements of earnings and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
	We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.  Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial state-
ments are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting prin-
ciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial state-
ment presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
	In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Chrysler Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993, in confor-
mity with generally accepted accounting principles.
	As discussed in the notes to the financial statements, the Company has adopted recently issued
Statements of Financial Accounting Standards and, accordingly, changed its methods of accounting for postre-
tirement benefits other than pensions and postemployment benefits in 1993, and its method of accounting
for income taxes in 1992.  In addition, the Company changed its method of accounting for the cost of special
sales incentive programs in 1991.


See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	In 1988, the Company entered into Incentive Unit Agree-
ments, whereby, subject to certain conditions, certain officers
were given the right to receive cash awards based on the market
value of 1.2 million shares of the Company's common stock at
the measurement dates.  Under the Incentive Unit Agreements,
the employee is reimbursed by the Company for income taxes
imposed when the value of the units is paid, but not for taxes
generated by the reimbursement payment.  As of December 31,
1993, 400,000 units have been paid and 800,000 units were
outstanding.

	In 1985, the Company entered into Performance Unit
Agreements, whereby certain officers were given the right to
receive cash awards based on the difference in the market
value of approximately 2.2 million shares of the Company's
common stock at the measurement dates and the base price
of $5.16, the market value as of January 2, 1985.  As of 
December 31, 1993, 780,000 units have been paid and
approximately 1.4 million units were outstanding.

13.  Pension Benefits
The Company sponsors and/or contributes to pension plans
covering substantially all U.S. employees and certain em-
ployees in international locations.  The benefits are primarily
based on years of service and the employees' compensation
for certain periods during the last years of employment.
Pension costs are generally funded currently, subject to
regulatory funding limitations.  The Company also sponsors
nonqualified, unfunded defined benefit plans for certain
officers and other employees.  In addition, the Company and
its subsidiaries have various pension plans and other forms
of postretirement arrangements outside the United States.


The funded status for the Company's defined benefit plans is as follows (in millions):


The assumptions used in computing the preceding information are as follows:


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	As the result of changes in U.S. tax law, the Company
was required to record charges for additional taxes and
tax-related expenses that reduced net income by approxi-
mately $51 million in 1993.  The Company's effective tax
rate reflects the favorable U.S. tax treatment from manu-
facturing facilities in Puerto Rico that operate under a
negotiated exemption grant that expires December 31,
2009, as well as the tax benefit derived from significant
operations outside the United States, which are taxed at
rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent.
Changes to U.S. tax law enacted in 1993 will limit the
utilization of the favorable tax treatment from operations
in Puerto Rico beginning in 1994, and will exert upward
pressure on the Company's effective tax rate.
	Appropriate U.S. and international taxes have been
provided for earnings of subsidiary companies that are
expected to be remitted to the parent company.  The cumu-
lative amount of unremitted earnings of international
subsidiaries that are expected to be indefinitely reinvested,
exclusive of amounts that, if remitted, would result in little
or no tax, is approximately $426 million at December 31,
1993.  The taxes that would be paid upon remittance of
these earnings are approximately $149 million.

16.  Net Change in Operating Assets and Liabilities
The changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of effects
of acquisitions and divestitures of businesses and unreal-
ized exchange gains/losses, are as follows (in millions):

responsibilities


independent auditors' report


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ConAgra, Inc. and subsidiaries as of May 29, 1994 and
May 30, 1993, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, common stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the
three years (fifty-two/fifty-three weeks) in the period ended May 29, 1994.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
ConAgra, Inc.  and subsidiaries as of May 29, 1994 and May 30, 1993, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years (fifty-two/fifty-three weeks) in the period ended May 29, 1994 in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

  As discussed in Note 17, the consolidated financial statements give effect to the Company's adoption, effective June 1, 1992, of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions."


Principal Officers
The principal officers of the company include, among oth-
ers, those listed on pages 28 and 29 of this report.  The principal
officers are responsible for maintaining throughout the com-
pany a system of internal controls which protect the assets of
the company on a reasonable and economic basis.  They also are
responsible for maintaining records which permit the prepara-
tion of financial statements that fairly present the financial 
condition and results of operations of the company in accor-
dance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Audit Committee of the Board
The Audit Committee of ConAgra's Board of Directors is
composed entirely of outside directors and recommends the
appointment of the company's independent public accoun-
tants.  The Audit Committee meets regularly, and when 
appropriate separately, with the independent public accoun-
tants, the internal auditors and financial management.  Both
the independent public accountants and the internal auditors
have unrestricted access to the Audit Committee.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments
	The Company believes that the book value of short-term
financial instruments approximates their fair value.  For
these purposes, short-term is defined as any item that
matures, reprices, or represents a cash transaction between
willing parties within six months or less of the measurement
date.  All financial instruments are considered to have a fair
value which approximates book value at May 29, 1994,
unless otherwise specified.

2.  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

1994
	At May 30, 1993, the Company had a 50% equity inter-
est in Australia Meat Holdings Pty. Ltd. (AMH), an
Australian beef processor.  Effective the beginning of fiscal
1994, the Company increased its equity interest in AMH to
approximately 91%.  The purchase price of this additional
interest was approximately $61 million.  The accounts of
AMH have been included in the consolidated financial state-
ments since the beginning of fiscal 1994.

1993
	During fiscal 1993, the Company acquired certain busi-
nesses, two of which have been recorded as poolings of
interests, the revenues and net earnings of which did not
significantly affect consolidated results.

1992
	On July 11, 1991, Golden Valley Microwave Foods, Inc.
(Golden Valley) merged with ConAgra through an
exchange of .8514 of a share of ConAgra common stock for
each share of Golden Valley common stock.  Golden Valley
is a leader in the development and marketing of foods
specifically for preparation in microwave ovens.  Products
include popcorn, french fries, breakfast foods and sand-
wiches distributed through vending industry, mass
merchandising outlets and grocery stores.  ConAgra issued
15.0 million shares of common stock for Golden Valley's
18.8 million shares of common stock and assumed out-
standing options for approximately 1.0 million shares of
ConAgra common stock.  In addition, outstanding warrants
for 0.6 million shares of Golden Valley stock were con-
verted to warrants to purchase 0.5 million shares of
ConAgra common stock at $40.32 per share.  The transac-
tion has been accounted for as a pooling of interests.  The
exchange ratio and share amounts above have been revised
to reflect ConAgra's 3-for-2 stock split on December 2,
1991.  The historical financial statements of the Company
have been restated to give effect to the acquisition as though
the companies had operated together from the beginning of
the earliest period presented.
	On January 2, 1992, all of the outstanding capital stock
of Arrow Industries, Inc. was exchanged for 5,250,000


shares of ConAgra common stock in a transaction
accounted for as a pooling of interests.  Financial informa-
tion for periods prior to this transaction has not been
restated because of immateriality and, accordingly, results of
operations have been included since the date of acquisition.

3. RECEIVABLES

	During September 1990, the Company entered into
agreements to sell, for a period of up to five years, undivided
participation interests in designated pools of receivables,
with limited recourse, in an amount not to exceed $400 mil-
lion at any one time.  During each April of 1994 and 1993,
the agreement was temporarily increased to $500 million for
a period of up to six months, at which time it automatically
reduces to the original $400 million. Participation interests
in new receivables may be sold as collections reduce previ-
ously sold participation interests.  The participation interests
are sold at a discount which is included in Selling,
Administrative and General Expenses in the consolidated
statements of earnings.  In connection with this transaction,
the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements
with two money center bank counterparties which effec-
tively fix the discount rate on $400 million of such
participation interests at 9.4% for five years.  The estimated
fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was an obliga-
tion of $21.3 million as of May 29, 1994.  Gross proceeds
from the sales were approximately $500 million as of May
29, 1994 and May 30, 1993.
	Receivables of Monfort Finance Company include notes
receivable of approximately $254 million and $273 million at
May 29, 1994 and May 30, 1993, respectively.

4.  INVENTORIES

	The major classes of inventories are as follows:

	Under the long-term credit facility indicated in Note 7, at
May 29, 1994, the Company may borrow up to $500 million
through October 14, 1998.
	The subordinated notes of Geldermann, Inc., a wholly
owned subsidiary, are placed with banks and are subordi-
nated to the claims of present and future general creditors.
The loans mature on July 31, 1995, and bear interest on a
floating rate basis (7.313% at May 29, 1994).  This is at a
premium over the one-month LIBOR rate.  The loan agree-
ments stipulate that these loans cannot be repaid if such
repayment would cause Geldermann, Inc. not to meet its
regulatory capital requirements.  The Company does not
guarantee Geldermann, Inc. borrowings.
	The most restrictive note agreements (the revolving
credit facilities and certain privately placed long-term debt)
provide that the lenders may require the Company to repay
the debt if (based on terms as defined in the agreements)
Consolidated Funded Debt exceeds 60% of Consolidated
Capital Base or if Fixed Charges coverage is less than 1.75
to 1.0.
	Net interest expense consists of:


	Included above is short-term interest expense of financial
businesses of $13.7 million, $10.2 million and $13.0 million
in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
	Short-term debt interest expense of $12.7 million, $14.6
million and $17.1 million in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively, incurred to finance hedged inventories, has been
charged to cost of goods sold.
	Net interest paid was $242.1 million, $239.3 million and
$269.7 million in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
	The carrying amount of long-term debt (including current
installments) was $2,327.5 million as of May 29, 1994.
Based on current market rates primarily provided by outside
investment bankers, the fair value of this debt was estimated
at $2,431.3 million.  The Company's long-term debt is gener-
ally not callable until maturity.

9.  OTHER NONCURRENT LIABILITIES

	Other noncurrent liabilities consist of estimated liabilities
of Beatrice Company (acquired in fiscal 1991), estimated
postretirement health care and pension benefits, and deferred
income tax credits, as follows:


	In fiscal 1992 and 1993, the Company made cash pay-
ments to the Internal Revenue Service relating to certain
of the disputed income tax liabilities of the Beatrice
Companies.  These cash payments, which aggregated
$139 million in fiscal 1993 and $150 million in fiscal
1992, are recoverable to the extent that the Company is
successful in resolving the disputed issues for an amount
less than paid (see Note 16).  The payments were made to
mitigate future interest expense associated with the dis-
puted income taxes, and have been netted against the
related noncurrent liabilities.

10.  PREFERRED SECURITIES OF SUBSIDIARY COMPANY

	In April 1994, ConAgra Capital, L.C., an indirectly
wholly owned finance subsidiary of ConAgra, Inc., issued
4.0 million 9% Series A Cumulative Preferred Securities
(Class A Securities) at a price of $25 per security.
Subsequent to year end, during June 1994, ConAgra
Capital, L.C., issued 7.0 million Series B Adjustable Rate
Cumulative Preferred Securities (Class B Securities) at a
price of $25 per security.  ConAgra Capital, L.C. loaned the
net proceeds to ConAgra, Inc. to be used for general corpo-
rate purposes.
	Dividends on the Class A Securities at the rate of 9% per
annum are payable monthly commencing May 31, 1994.
Dividends on the Class B Securities are payable monthly
commencing on June 30, 1994 at a rate per annum which
is adjusted quarterly to 95% of the highest of three U.S.
Treasury security indices.  The dividend rate on the Class B
Securities has a floor of 5.0% and a ceiling of 10.5% per
annum and was established pursuant to the formula at
7.06% for the quarterly period ending August 31, 1994.
	The Class A Securities and Class B Securities are guaran-
teed on a limited basis by ConAgra, Inc. and, in certain
limited circumstances, are exchangeable for debt securities
of ConAgra, Inc.  The Class A and Class B Securities are
redeemable at the option of ConAgra Capital, L.C. (with
ConAgra, Inc.'s consent) in whole or in part, on or after
May 31, 1999 with respect to Class A Securities and June
30, 1999 with respect to Class B Securities, at $25 per secu-
rity plus accumulated and unpaid dividends to the date
fixed for redemption.


	Deferred tax assets have been reduced by a valuation
allowance as realization of some portion of these future tax
benefits is subject to significant uncertainties.  Favorable reso-
lution of these uncertainties would result in a reduction in the
valuation allowance which would principally reduce goodwill.
	Income taxes paid were $203.9 million, $194.3 million and
$151.6 million in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

15.  COMMITMENTS

	Certain facilities and transportation equipment are leased
under agreements expiring at various dates during the next
fourteen years.  Management expects that in the normal course
of business, leases that expire will be renewed or replaced by
other leases.  Substantially all leases require payment of prop-
erty taxes, insurance and maintenance costs in addition to
rental payments.
	A summary of rent expense charged to operations follows:


	In connection with its trading activities, the Company
had letters of credit and performance bonds outstanding at
May 29, 1994, aggregating approximately $581.9 million.

16.  CONTINGENCIES

	With respect to operations of the Company excluding
the transaction discussed below, there was no litigation at
May 29, 1994 which, in the opinion of management,
would have a material adverse effect on the financial posi-
tion of the Company.
	On August 14, 1990, ConAgra acquired Beatrice
Company.  The Beatrice businesses and its former subsidiaries
(Subsidiaries) are engaged in various litigation proceedings
incident to their respective businesses and in various environ-
mental and other matters.  Beatrice and various of its
Subsidiaries have agreed to indemnify divested businesses or
the purchasers thereof for various legal proceedings and tax
matters.  The federal income tax returns of Beatrice and its
predecessors for the fiscal years ended 1985 through 1987
have been audited by the Internal Revenue Service and a
report has been issued.  The findings contained in the examin-
ing agent's report have been timely protested and negotiations
with the Appellate Division of the Internal Revenue Service
are under way in an attempt to resolve disputed items.
Disputed items being negotiated with the Appellate Division
of the Internal Revenue Service include proposed deficiencies
relating to previously filed carryback claims to fiscal years
ended prior to 1985 (principally fiscal years ended 1982
through 1984).  Additionally, the federal income tax returns
of Beatrice and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the fiscal years
ended 1988 and 1989, have been audited by the Internal
Revenue Service and a report has been issued.  Management
intends to protest the unagreed findings of the examining
agent's report and to negotiate disputed items with the
Appellate Division of the Internal Revenue Service.  Various
state tax authorities are also examining tax returns of Beatrice
and its predecessors for prior taxable years, including, in the
case of one state, years back to fiscal 1978.  It is expected that
additional claims will be asserted for additional taxes.  It is not
possible at this time to determine the ultimate liabilities that
may arise from these matters which at any given point in time
will be at various stages of administrative and legal proceed-
ings and will aggregate hundreds of millions of dollars.
Substantial reserves for these matters have been established
and are reflected as liabilities on the Subsidiaries' balance
sheets.  The liabilities include accrued interest on the tax
claims.  After taking into account liabilities that have been
recorded and payments made, management is of the opinion
that the disposition of the above matters will not have a mate-
rial adverse effect on ConAgra's financial condition, results of
operations or liquidity.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

A	Special Charge and Accounting Change

The second quarter of 1993 included a special pretax charge of
$180 by Marion Merrell Dow Inc.  This special charge reflected
Marion Merrell Dow's plans to reduce its work force in line with
current business conditions and redesign its U.S. business organiza-
tion.  The Company holds an interest in Marion Merrell Dow Inc.
of approximately 72 percent.
	During the fourth quarter of 1992, opportunities were identi-
fied to streamline the Company and a special pretax charge of $433
was taken.  This charge reflected asset write-offs and write-downs,
plant shutdowns, divestitures and the consolidation of a variety of
business activities globally.  Included were costs related to work
force reductions associated with these activities.
	The fourth quarter of 1991 included a special pretax charge of
$370 for shutdown and divestiture of a variety of facilities and busi-
ness activities primarily in basic chemicals and plastics.  The deci-
sion to take this special charge was consistent with Dow's strategy
to divert into specialties.  Actions contemplated by the 1992 and
1991 special charges are substantially complete, with no significant
adjustments required to the estimates.
	Effective December 31, 1993, the Company adopted FASB
Statement No. 115 ("Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities").  This statement requires certain invest-
ments in debt and equity securities to be classified as either
Trading, Available-for-Sale, or Held-to-Maturity.  Investments clas-
sified as Trading are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and
losses included in income.  Investments classified as Available-for-
Sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses
recorded in a separate component of stockholders' equity.
Investments classified as Held-to-Maturity are recorded at amor-


tized cost.  The impact on net income for the year was not material.
The effect of the change was an increase to stockholders' equity of
$107.  Prior year amounts were not restated.
	The Company will adopt FASB Statement No. 112
("Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits") in 1994,
and anticipates that the financial impact will not be material.
	Effective January 1, 1992, Dow adopted FASB Statement
No. 106 ("Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions"), FASB Statement No. 107 ("Disclosures
about Fair Value of Financial Instruments") and FASB Statement
No. 109 ("Accounting for Income Taxes").  Financial statements
prior to 1992 were not restated.
	FASB Statement No. 106 requires employers to recognize the
cost of certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to
retirees and their dependents as a liability during the employees'
active years of service.  In making the transition to adopt this
required accounting standard, a charge of $994 or $3.66 per share
was made against 1992 net income.  This change also had the effect
of increasing 1992 pretax operating expenses from $58 (under the
previous accounting method) to $165.
	FASB Statement No. 109 changes the method of accounting
for income taxes.  The favorable cumulative effect of implementation
was $229 or 84 cents per share.  The credit for deferred income taxes
for 1992 would have been $191 if prepared in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 11 instead of the
$295 recorded under FASB Statement No. 109.
	The $229 favorable impact, together with the $994 charge
mentioned above, are shown as a net cumulative charge of $765
against 1992 net income.

M  Pension Plans and Other Postemployment Benefits
The Company has defined benefit pension plans which cover
employees in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries.  The
Company's funding policy is to contribute annually, at a rate that is
intended to approximate a level percentage of compensation for the
covered employees, to those plans where pension laws and eco-
nomics either require or encourage funding.

The U.S. funded plan is the largest plan.  Its benefits are based
on length of service and the employee's three-highest consecutive
years of compensation.  The weighted average discount rate and rate
of increase in future compensation levels used in determining the
actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligations were
7.25 and 5.5 percent, respectively, for 1993 and 8.25 and 6 per-
cent, respectively, for 1992.  The assumed long-term rate of return
on assets was 9 percent for 1993 and 9 percent for 1992.

All other pension plans used assumptions in determining the
actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligations that are
consistent with (but not identical to) those of the U.S. plan.

The funded status of fully funded, significant defined benefit
plans for the Company was as follows:


Defined contribution plans cover employees in Australia, New
Zealand, Spain, the United Kingdom and some U.S. subsidiaries.
In addition, employees in the U.S. are eligible to participate in
defined contribution plans (Employee Savings Plans) by contribut-
ing a portion of their compensation.  The Company matches com-
pensation, depending on Company profit levels.  Contributions
charged to income for defined contribution plans were $92 in
1993, $98 in 1992 and $89 in 1991.

In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company pro-
vides certain health care and life insurance benefits to retired
employees.  As discussed in Note A, the Company adopted FASB
Statement No. 106 effective January 1, 1992.  Previously, the
Company recognized the cost of providing these benefits as the
benefits were paid.  These pretax costs amounted to $53 in 1991.
The Company continues to fund most of the cost of these medical
and life insurance benefits in the year incurred.

The U.S. plan covering the parent company is the largest plan.
It provides medical and life insurance benefits including hospital,
physicians' services and major medical expense benefits and life
insurance benefits.  The plan provides benefits supplemental to 
Medicare after retirees are eligible for these benefits.  The cost of
these benefits are shared by the Company and the retiree, with the
Company portion increasing as the retiree has increased years of 
credited service.  The Company has the ability to change these 
benefits at any time.

Effective October 1993, the Company amended its health
benefits plan in the U.S. to cap the cost absorbed by the Company
at approximately twice the 1993 cost per person for employees who
retire after December 31, 1993.  The effect of this amendment was
to reduce the December 31, 1993 accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation by $327.  It also reduced the net periodic postre-
tirement cost by $21 for 1993 and is estimated to reduce this cost
for 1994 by approximately $83.

P	Combined Financial Statements of Principal
	50 Percent Owned Companies
The summarized financial statements below include the combined
accounts of the principal companies in which Dow owns a 50 per-
cent interest.  Amounts presented include the assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses of the following major international compa-
nies:  Dow Corning Corporation, a manufacturer of silicone and 
silicone products; Dow-United Technologies Composite
Products, Inc., a manufacturer of composite products; and Gurit-
Essex A.G., a Swiss company, which supplies European automobile
manufacturers with proprietary specialty products.  The 1992 and
1991 amounts also include the Dowell Schlumberger companies,
sold in January 1993.

	The Company's equity investment in these companies was
$491 and $959 in 1993 and 1992, respectively, and its equity por-
tion of earnings (loss) was $(138), $7 and $117 in 1993, 1992 and
1991, respectively.  The Company's equity investment was reduced
significantly in 1993 due to the sale of its holding in Dowell
Schlumberger (see Note C) and the charge taken by Dow Corning
Corporation related to breast implant litigation (see Note O).


Q	Industry Segments and Geographic Areas
The Company conducts its worldwide operations through separate
geographic area organizations which represent major markets or
combinations of related markets.  Transfers between areas are
generally valued at cost plus a markup.

	Aggregation of products is generally made on the basis of pro-
cess technology, end-use markets and channels of distribution.

	Chemicals and Performance Products contains a wide range of 
products that are used primarily as raw materials in the manufac-
ture of customer products, or which aid in the processing of cus-
tomer products and services.

	Plastic Products consists of a broad range of thermoplastics,
thermosets and plastic fabricated products used in a wide variety of 
applications in markets which include packaging, automotive, elec-
tronics, and building among many others.

	Hydrocarbons and Energy encompasses procurement of fuels
and petroleum-based raw materials as well as the production of 


olefins, aromatics, styrene and cogenerated power and steam for use
in manufacturing the Company's plastics, chemicals and metals.
Income from the construction of power plants by Destec Energy,
Inc. is also recorded in this segment.

	Consumer Specialties includes agricultural chemicals, phar-
maceuticals, and food care, home care, and personal care products.

	Unallocated includes activities of the insurance companies,
the finance operations, unallocated overhead cost variances and 
certain research expenses on developmental products that are not
related to current business (1992 and 1993).

	Transfers between industry segments are generally valued at
standard cost.


polymers


off Singapore, is needed to meet growing customer demand for DuPont
"Zytel" nylon resin throughout the Asia Pacific region.  Start-up is sched-
uled for 1995.  "Zytel" is used in a wide range of applications, including
automotive and electrical components.  We also purchased Ciba-Geigy's 
PBT (polybutylene terephthalate) polyester business in Germany, which
strengthens our global position in polyester resins and electrical mar-
kets.  Except for "Corian" solid surface material, used in applications
such as sinks and countertops, we sold our acrylics business to ICI as
part of our strategy of focusing resources on those businesses in which
we have unique strengths and the opportunity for global growth.

	A combination of cost-reduction programs and improving market
conditions, primarily in the United States, brought gains late in the year.

1993 VERSUS 1992
Sales were up less than 1 percent as increased sales in the United
States were essentially offset by lower sales in other regions.  A world-
wide 5 percent volume increase was offset by lower prices resulting
principally from the currency exchange effects of a stronger dollar.


Events of Note

~ In the first quarter the company sold its worldwide connector
systems business to Hicks, Muse and Company, as part of its strategy
for divestiture of non-core businesses.  Proceeds were about $270
million, with negligible impact on earnings.

~ At mid-year, DuPont and Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd. (ICI)
completed transactions in which DuPont acquired for about $475 mil-
lion ICI's worldwide fibers business and ICI acquired for $280 million
DuPont's acrylics business, excluding "Corian".  The purchase
strengthens the company's nylon market position, particularly in
Europe, where most of ICI's business was based.  The acrylics sale
had minimal earnings impact.

~ In the third quarter, the company announced additional restructur-
ings and recorded after-tax charges of $1.3 billion, principally for
asset write-offs, the most significant of which were for goodwill,
technology and rationalization of excess capacity in the printing and
publishing businesses.

~ In the fourth quarter, the company completed sales of the
Remington Arms Company and DuPont Canada's "Sclair" polyethyl-
ene business.  A net after-tax gain of $52 million was recorded.
Proceeds of $300 million from the Remington sale were used primari-
ly to retire debt.

~ Also in the fourth quarter, the company took an additional $126
million after-tax charge in connection with the "Benlate" DF 50 fungi-
cide recall.  This additional accrual for "Benlate" DF 50 updates the
estimate of costs based on recent experience of court
trials, review of case histories and rate of spending on litigation.
Adverse changes in estimates for these costs could result in addition-
al future charges.


Restructuring
During 1993, the company announced a number of steps for strategic
restructuring, primarily for improving competitiveness in global mar-
kets, but also to streamline internal organizations and eliminate large
business sectors in favor of smaller, strategic business units.
Restructuring charges of $1,295 million, after taxes, were taken in the 
third quarter.  These include $375 million for employee separation
costs related to the elimination of about 9,000 positions worldwide.
Other charges were for write-offs, principally of goodwill and technol-
ogy arising from printing and publishing acquisitions in the late
1980's, various facilities shutdowns and asset write-downs.  The
latter included write-downs for certain North American petroleum-
producing properties sold in the fourth quarter, polymer production
lines in LaPorte, Texas, nylon textile production lines in Martinsville,
Virginia, and polyester filament production lines in Cooper River,
South Carolina.  It is estimated that 1994 earnings will reflect
more than $300 million of after-tax cost savings related to this
restructuring.

Sales
Sales in 1993 were $37.1 billion, down 2 percent from 1992.  Sales in
the Petroleum segment and the combination of all other segments
were both about 2 percent below 1992.  Lower sales were principally
due to lower prices, partly offset by higher volumes.  The sales decline
for the combined Chemicals, Fibers, Polymers, and Diversified
Businesses segments reflects 4 percent lower sales outside of the 
United States, largely due to adverse exchange effects from a
stronger dollar, partly offset by higher volume.  After adjusting for the 
divestiture of the connector systems business, U.S. sales were up
1 percent, reflecting slightly higher volume and prices.  Fibers had
increased sales resulting from the acquisition of ICI's nylon business,
and Polymers had increased sales to the U.S. automotive industry.

Sales in 1992 were $37.8 billion, 2 percent below 1991, principally
reflecting the absence of sales from the coal business; which has
been accounted for under the equity method since the beginning of
1992.  After adjusting for the coal business, sales were up 2 percent,
principally reflecting higher volumes worldwide.  Currency exchange
rates had no significant effect on the change in sales.


Over the last three years, the company's EITR exceeded the U.S.
statutory rate of 35% in 1993, and 34% in 1992 and 1991, principally
because of the higher tax rates associated with petroleum production
operations outside the United States.  The 1993 EITR decreased about
5 percentage points from the prior year, principally reflecting a lower
effective tax rate in Petroleum operations and the $265 million tax
benefit described above, partly offset by an increased proportion of
higher-taxed Petroleum earnings.  The decrease in the 1992 EITR,
versus 1991, reflected a lower proportion of higher-taxed Petroleum
earnings due to a reduced level of earnings in that segment, partly
offset by an increase in the EITR from adoption of SFAS No. 109.

surrendered, retired, sold or otherwise disposed of, the assets
involved determine if gain or loss is recognized, or the gross
carrying value is charged to accumulated depreciation, depletion
and amortization and any salvage or other recovery therefrom is
credited to accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization.

Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations; replacements
and betterments are capitalized.

Oil and Gas Properties
The company's exploration and production activities are accounted
for under the successful-efforts method.  Costs of acquiring unproved
properties are capitalized, and impairment of those properties, which
are individually insignificant, is provided for by amortizing the cost
thereof based on past experience and the estimated holding period.
Geological, geophysical and delay rental costs are expensed as
incurred.  Costs of exploratory dry holes are expensed as the wells are
determined to be dry.  Costs of productive properties, production and
support equipment, and development costs are capitalized and 
amortized on a unit-of-production basis.

Intangible Assets
Identifiable intangible assets such as purchased patents and
trademarks are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated
useful lives.  Goodwill is amortized over periods up to 40 years on the
straight-line method.

Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures
Accruals for environmental matters are recorded in operating
expenses when it is probable that a liability has been incurred
and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated.  Accrued
liabilities are exclusive of claims against third parties and are not
discounted.

In general, costs related to environmental remediation are 
charged to expense.  Environmental costs are capitalized if the
costs increase the value of the property and/or mitigate or prevent
contamination from future operations.

Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes for 1993 and 1992 has been
determined under SFAS No. 109, which requires use of the asset and
liability approach to accounting for income taxes.  Under that
approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences 
expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
are recovered or paid.  The provision for income taxes represents
income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in
deferred taxes during the year.  Deferred taxes result from differences
between the financial and tax bases of the company's assets and
liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws

had approximately $90 million of contractually committed
support facilities available outside the U.S., of which about 75%
were in use at December 31, 1993.

New Accounting Standards
In November 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 112 ("SFAS 112"), "Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits," which requires companies to account
for employee benefits on an accrual basis for periods when
employees are no longer actively employed but have not yet
reached retirement.  The effect on the company's financial state-
ments was not material.

In May 1993, the FASB issued SFAS 114, "Accounting by
Creditors for Impairment of a Loan."  The standard requires that
impaired loans be measured based on the present value of expected
future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate.
The company does not plan to adopt this standard until
January 1, 1995, and the effect is not expected to be material.

In May 1993, the FASB issued SFAS 115, "Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities."  The standard
establishes financial accounting and reporting requirements for
investments in equity securities (excluding those accounted for
under the equity method and investments in consolidated
subsidiaries) that have readily determinable fair values and for all
investments in debt securities.  The company has adopted this
standard effective January 1, 1994, and the effect is not expected 
to be material.


MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY


Management is responsible for the preparation of the company's
financial statements and the other financial information in this
report.  This responsibility includes maintaining the integrity and
objectivity of the financial records and the presentation of the
company's financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

The company maintains an internal control structure intended
to provide, among other things, reasonable assurance that its
records include the transactions of its operations in all material
respects and to provide protection against significant misuse or
loss of company assets.  The internal control structure is supported
by a staff of internal auditors who employ thorough auditing
programs, by careful selection and training of financial manage-
ment personnel, and by written procedures that communicate the
details of the internal control structure to the company's world-
wide activities.

The company's financial statements have been audited by
Coopers & Lybrand, independent certified public accountants.
Their audit was conducted in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards which included consideration of the company's


internal control structure.  The Report of Independent Accoun-
tants appears on page 43.

The Board of Directors, acting through its Audit Committee
composed solely of directors who are not employees of the
company, is responsible for determining that management fulfills
its responsibilities in the preparation of financial statements and
the financial control of operations.  The Audit Committee
appoints the independent accountants, subject to ratification by
the stockholders.  It meets regularly with management, internal
auditors, and independent accountants.  The independent
accountants have full and free access to the Audit Committee and
meet with it to discuss their audit work, the company's internal
controls, and financial reporting matters.


Some have argued that single-product busi-
nesses have a focus that gives them an advantage
over multibusiness companies like our own -~
and perhaps they would have, but only if we ne-
glect our own overriding advantage:  the ability
to share the ideas that are the result of wide and
rich input from a multitude of global sources.

GE businesses share technology, design,
compensation and personnel evaluation systems,
manufacturing practices, and customer and
country knowledge.  Gas Turbines shares manu-
facturing technology with Aircraft Engines;
Motors and Transportation Systems work
together on new locomotive propulsion systems;
Lighting and Medical Systems collaborate to
improve x-ray tube processes; and GE Capital 
provides innovative financing packages that help
all our businesses around the globe.  These are
just a few of the thousands of examples of how
our businesses work together.  Supporting all this
is a management system that fosters and rewards
this sharing and teamwork, and, increasingly, a


culture that makes it reflexive and natural at
every level and corner of our Company.

When we began our pursuit of boundaryless-
ness, we believed that the boundaries just de-
scribed -~ the walls, if you will -~ would be the 
most difficult to eliminate, while the hierarchical
management layers would be the easiest because 
they could simply be taken out by directive.  The
big, visible layers at the top of the Company -~
Sectors, Groups and the like -~ were easy to get
rid of, but deeper within the businesses, the
layers -~ formal and informal -~ are not only
hard to remove, they are often hard to find.  The
compulsion to manage, to control, to direct, is a
powerful one, reinforced by a century-old tradi-
tion at GE of measuring one's self-worth by how
many people "work for you" and whether or not
the word "manager" appears in your title.  The
highest compliment you could give GE managers
a few years ago was to say they were "on top of
things" or had gotten "their arms around them."
These techniques, more useful in tackling people
than coaching them, are difficult to get rid of.

What we are looking for today at GE are lead-
ers at every level who can energize, excite and
coach rather than enervate, depress and control.
And never has this atmosphere been more criti-
cal.  Today, everyone must be engaged if we are to 
win.  The kind of people we need in this Company
are those unwilling to "put in their time" in the
bowels of the bureaucracy, or grunt along under
the heel of some autocrat for years, before they get
a chance to make decisions, try something and
be rewarded in their souls as well as their wallets.

In some difficult cases this means parting
company with some impressive people -~ Heis-
man Trophy candidates, to use an American
football expression -~ who won't block for others
or play as part of a team.  Their debilitating effect
on the team can outweigh the benefits of their
individual talent.  Leaders at GE are now sub-
ject to what we call a 360~ evaluation, meaning
they are rated not just by those above them, but
by their peers and their subordinates as well.
This has become a powerful tool for detecting
and changing those who "smile up and kick
down."  To be blunt, the two quickest ways to
part company with GE are, one, to commit an
integrity violation, or, two, to be a controlling,


1993 was one of the most dynamic years in GE
Lighting's history.  We had close to double-digit
earnings growth, before restructuring costs, on
stable revenues as we continued global expansion
and development of high-technology products
for increased energy efficiency and light quality.
We again made major gains in productivity, with
increased employee involvement in cycle-time
reductions and quality enhancements.  Over the
past two years, we have cut our product develop-
ment-to-market cycle by half, and we aim to re-
duce this cycle by an additional 50%.
  Our technology efforts continue to be focused
on the fastest-growing energy-saving lighting
products, including the popular compact fluores-
cents.  Our investment in technology produced a
significant number of new products -~ up 75%
in 1993.  During the past five years, we added
more than 300 types of energy-saving lamps, and
our sales of these rose nearly 200% each year.
  Key to this achievement is the involvement of
global program teams located in our major mar-
kets.  To accelerate top-line growth in consumer,
commercial and industrial markets, we formed a
New Product Ventures organization to develop
and sell specialty lighting products.  The team's
goal is to be fast, flexible and quick to market.
  Equally significant to our 1993 success was
continued strategic globalization.  We agreed to
form a joint venture in China, GE Jiabao Light-
ing Company, Ltd., to manufacture, distribute
and sell a full line of lighting products in Chi-
na's fast-growing, $550 million lighting market.
   We also strengthened our position in Japan
with the start-up of Hitachi GE Lighting, Ltd.
This joint venture has introduced 75 different
lamp types to the Japanese market, providing
major export opportunities for GE plants in
North America and Europe.  The JV now serves
the $2 billion Japanese lighting market through
some 100 distributors, who have more than 400
offices and supply about 10,000 Hitachi retail
outlets.  In India, our GE Apar Lighting venture
continued to expand with investments in new fa-
cilities and in the only "ribbon" glassmaking
equipment in India or Southeast Asia.  Additional
ventures in Thailand and Indonesia position us
as a clear leader in this fast-growing region.

GECS allowance for losses on financing receivables repre-
sented 2.63% of total financing receivables at year-end
1993 and 1992.  The allowance for small-balance receiv-
ables is determined principally on the basis of actual ex-
perience during the preceding three years.  Further allow-
ances are provided to reflect management's judgment of
additional loss potential.  For other receivables, principally
the larger loans and leases, the allowance for losses is de-
termined primarily on the basis of management's judg-
ment of net loss potential, including specific allowances
for known troubled accounts.  The table below shows the ac-
tivity in the allowance for losses on financing receivables
during each of the past three years.


  All accounts or portions thereof deemed to be uncollec-
tible or to require an excessive collection cost are written
off to the allowance for losses.  Small-balance accounts are
progressively written down (from 10% when more than
three months delinquent to 100% when 9-12 months
delinquent) to record the balances at estimated realizable
value.  If at any time during that period an account is
judged to be uncollectible, such as in the case of a bank-
ruptcy, the uncollectible balance is written off.  Large-
balance accounts are reviewed at least quarterly, and those
accounts that are more than three months delinquent are
written down, if necessary, to record the balances at esti-
mated realizable value.  Amounts written off in 1993 were
approximately 1.46% of average financing receivables
outstanding during the year, compared with 1.58% and
1.87% of average financing receivables outstanding dur-
ing 1992 and 1991, respectively.

CADILLAC


International Automotive Operations

GM's International Automotive Operations (IO)
were profitable in 1993 and 1992, although
results trailed the high profit levels achieved
in 1991.  Income of IO before accounting changes
was $1,224.9 million in 1993 versus $1,514.5
million in 1992 and $1,468.7 million in 1991.
Results in 1993 reflected record sales and prof-
its in GM's Latin American Operations (LAO).
Europe remained profitable despite an extremely
difficult economic climate, but profits were below
1992 levels.  The decline in 1993 earnings was
primarily attributable to a European car market
decline of 16.5%.
   During 1993, Europe's vehicle unit deliveries
declined by 10.5%, although GM increased its
car and truck market share to 12.6% in 1993
from 11.8% in 1992 and 11.3% in 1991.  By
increasing its overall passenger car market share
to 13.4% in 1993, up from 12.7% in 1992, and
12.2% in 1991, GM maintained second place 
among all manufacturers of passenger cars in
Western Europe.  This was the fifth straight year
of increased market share for Opel/Vauxhall in
Western Europe.  The technically identical Opel/
Vauxhall model range maintained its number
one position in the Western European car market
in 1993.  Opel's market share increased in 13
different countries.  The successful launch of
the new Corsa attributed significantly to this
favorable market share development, while the
Astra was again GM's largest selling model line


in Europe, maintaining its position as the second-
best-selling car in Europe.
   Progress was made in restructuring Saab's
operations during 1993.  Improvements in cost
efficiency and productivity ensured a successful
launch in 1993 of the new Saab 900, Saab
Automobile AB's first all-new product since the
joint venture company was established in 1990.
   LAO's performance exceeded all previous
records on sales and financial fronts.  By capital-
izing on market openings throughout the region,
with all-time record deliveries of over 402,000
units (up 28% vs. 1992), GM was able to
maintain its market share at 18%.  Led by GM
do Brasil's sales increase (45%), LAO was able
to post all-time record net income and operating
profits and records were also established in GM
operations in both Venezuela and Colombia.
GM Chile also achieved its second best year in
history.  LAO is poised for the future as it re-
established its manufacturing presence in Argentina
to take advantage of market growth.  All this
was accomplished amidst substantial political
uncertainty and increased competitive pressures
from Eastern European and Asian entries.
   While attaining an 18% increase in unit
deliveries in 1992 (versus 1991) to 314,000
units, GM continued to strengthen its financial
position in Latin America by posting record
operating profit as well.  The region also benefited
from a relatively low effective tax rate in 1993.
   Improved sales in Brazil, as well as record
sales in Chile and Ecuador, combined with


significant year-to-year increases in Venezuela,
Colombia, and Argentina, all contributed to GM's
18.0% regional market share -~ its highest over-
seas.  Sustained levels of sales and profitability
in Latin America are highly dependent upon
economic and political conditions in the region.
   In the Asia-Pacific region, financial perfor-
mance was favorable despite substantial new
business development costs incurred in expand-
ing GM's operations in the rapid-growth econo-
mies of China, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia.  In
Japan, the re-launch of Opel products in
partnership with Yanase & Company resulted in
record sales.  In Taiwan, local assembly of the
very popular Opel Astra commenced in May 1993
and, in September, a joint venture was formed
in Indonesia, where assembly of Opel models
is planned for 1994.  The VR Commodore
launched in mid-1993 by GM Holden's was
named Car of the Year in Australia.

GMAC

GMAC, in its role as a partner with General
Motors and GM dealers, serves the financing
and insurance needs of GM customers.
   Reference should be made to the condensed
GMAC financial statements included in Note 12
to the Financial Statements.
   Consolidated net income of GMAC for 1993
totaled $981.1 million, an increase of $45.0
million over 1992.
   Earnings for 1992 reflect an unfavorable
cumulative effect of an accounting change related
to implementation of SFAS No. 106 which reduced
1992 net income by $282.6 million. Excluding the
nonrecurring impact of SFAS No. 106, GMAC's 1993
earnings declined by $237.6 million year to year.
   Net income of $1,369.7 million in 1991
included a $331.5 million favorable cumulative
effect of an accounting change relative to imple-
mentation of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes, and a $170.9 million after-tax special
wholesale loss provision.  Excluding special items,
1992 income was $1,218.7 million compared to
$1,209.1 million in 1991.
   Net income from financing operations totaled
$790.6 million in 1993, compared with $1,011.6
million in 1992, excluding the cumulative impact 
of SFAS No. 106.  The decrease in earnings in
1993 is primarily attributable to lower asset
levels and tighter net interest rate margins in
North America (net of depreciation expense on
operating lease vehicles), partially offset by
higher earnings outside North America.
   Net income from financing operations in 1992
compared favorably with 1991 levels of $865.9
million (excluding the cumulative impact of
SFAS No. 109) due to a special wholesale loss
provision reported in 1991.
   Total financing revenue was $8,752.0 million
for 1993, $1,650.1 million below 1992 amounts.
Revenue from retail and lease financing was
$3,673.4 million, down 33.3%, while revenue
from leasing operations increased 9.7% to
$3,870.9 million.  Financing revenue from


wholesale and term loans declined $159.5
million from 1992 levels.
  Total financing revenue amounted to $10,402.1
million in 1992, a 6.7% decrease from 1991.
Revenue from retail and lease financing was
$5,507.0 million, down 20.5%, while revenue
from leasing operations increased 29.2% to
$3,527.9 million.  Financing revenue from whole-
sale and term loans remained relatively stable
at $1,367.2 million.
  Insurance premiums earned by Motors Insur-
ance Corporation totaling $1,107.2 million
decreased $52.5 million and $80.5 million
from 1992 and 1991 levels, respectively.
  Interest and discount expense declined 19.0%
to $4,721.2 million in 1993 and 14.8% to $5,828.6
million in 1992 as a result of the continued down-
ward trend in U.S. interest rates and the lower
level of borrowings.  Net interest margin (including
depreciation expense) declined $815.1 million
to $1,328.8 million in 1993 and $262.5 million
to $2,143.9 million in 1992, reflecting lower
earning asset levels attributable to GMAC's asset
securitization strategy and narrowing spreads
in the U.S.  This was partially offset by wider
spreads in GMAC's international operations.
  Total earning assets of GMAC were $74,783.8
million at December 31, 1993, down 14.2% from
year-end 1992.  The reduced level of earning assets
reflects lower financing levels of new GM cars
and trucks in the U.S. in 1993, as well as the
sales of receivables.  During 1993 and 1992, 
GMAC sold and securitized finance receivables
with principal amounting to $13.6 billion and
$12.0 billion, respectively.


  In the U.S., GMAC financed 28% of new GM
vehicles delivered by GM dealers during 1993,
down 5 percentage points from 1992 and 
7 percentage points from 1991.
  GMAC's total borrowings were $62,773.2
million at December 31, 1993, a 15.8% decrease
from the prior year-end.  Approximately 80.0%
of 1993 borrowings supported United States 
operations.
  The provision for financing losses amounted
to $300.8 million in 1993, a decrease of
$70.2 million and $747.1 million from 1992
and 1991, respectively, reflecting a lower level
of finance receivables outstanding, a $275 mil-
lion pre-tax nonrecurring special wholesale loss
provision in 1991, and better loss performance
trends in all segments of GMAC's businesses.

EDS

EDS achieved record earnings for the eighth con-
secutive year, reflecting continued strong perfor-
mance in its existing businesses as well as growth
in new markets.  Separate consolidated net income
increased 13.9% to $724.0 million in 1993 and
16.1% to $635.5 million in 1992 over $547.5
million in 1991.  Earnings per share attributable
to Class E common stock were $1.51 in 1993
and $1.33 in 1992, up from $1.17 before the
cumulative effect of an accounting change in 
1991, and are based on the Available Separate
Consolidated Net Income of EDS (described in
Note 9 to the Financial Statements).
  EDS is a world leader in systems integra-
tion and communications services.  Revenues from
sources outside GM and its affiliates rose 7.5%
in 1993 to $5,238.1 million and 30.3% in 1992


to $4,870.4 million and comprised 61.2% and
59.3%, respectively, of all EDS revenues.  In addi-
tion, EDS continued to assist GM in a variety of
re-engineering processes being implemented in
the Corporation's factories and offices.
  EDS financial statements do not include the
amortization of the $2,179.5 million initial cost
to GM of EDS customer contracts, computer soft-
ware programs, and other intangible assets,
including goodwill, arising from the acquisition
of EDS by GM in 1984.  This cost, plus the
$343.2 million cost of contingent notes purchased
in 1986, less certain income tax benefits, was
assigned principally to intangible assets, includ-
ing goodwill, and is being amortized by GM over
the estimated useful lives of the assets acquired.
Such amortization, charged against Other Sector
income, was $34.9 million in 1993 and 1992,
and $169.4 million in 1991.

GMHE

GMHE reported earnings of $921.6 million in
1993.  This compares with a loss of $921.6
million in 1992 which included the restructur-
ing charge and accounting changes for post-
retirement benefits and revenue recognition
described previously, and earnings of $559.4
million in 1991 which included the accounting
changes for general purpose spare parts and
income taxes described previously.  Excluding
these special items, GMHE earnings in 1992
and 1991 would have been $699.9 million and
$505.0 million, respectively.
  Revenues increased 9.9% to $13,517.5 million
in 1993 and 6.6% to $12,297.1 million in 1992.
Revenue increases in 1993 were primarily due
to a full year of operations of the missile
business acquired in August 1992 and to the
increased production volumes and electronic
content per vehicle in the automotive electronics
segment.  The improvement in operating results
was due to the aforementioned revenue increase,
cost reductions, and improved margins in both
the automotive electronics and defense segments.
  GMHE participates in four major business
segments: automotive electronics, telecommuni-
cations and space, defense electronics, and com-
mercial technologies.  Revenues for the automo-
tive electronics sector were $4,491.6 million,
up 12.7% from $3,985.8 million in 1992 and
$3,660.4 million in 1991.  Telecommunications
and space revenues were $2,178.0 million, a
13.0% increase over the 1992 total of $1,927.9
million and a 17.9% increase over 1991.  Defense
electronics revenues for 1993 were $6,112.1
million compared with $5,547.0 million in 1992
and $5,325.1 million in 1991.  Commercial
technologies 1993 revenues were $735.8
million, a 12.0% decrease from 1992 but a
4.0% increase over 1991.


Diverse mix indicates GMHE growth potential.

  GMHE also provides direct support to GM
by supplying components and technologies for
GM vehicles.
  In July 1993, GMHE sold its 30% ownership
interest in the Japan Communications Satellite
Company which resulted in a $89.7 million pre-
tax gain.  In December 1993, GMHE sold Hughes
Rediffusion Simulation Limited and related
entities which resulted in a pre-tax loss of
$55.0 million.
  Amounts for 1992 include a $28.0 million
pre-tax gain on the sale of assets to Hughes-JVC
Technology Corporation and $35.0 million of
pre-tax income from a patent infringement set-
tlement.  In August 1992, GMHE acquired the


missile business of General Dynamics Corpora-
tion (GD) for 21.5 million shares of Class H
common stock valued at $450.0 million and cash
of $62.8 million.  Subsequently, GD sold those
shares as part of a 29.1 million share public
offering of Class H common stock.  The principal
purpose of the offering was to broaden the pub-
lic trading market for Class H shares and thereby
increase their liquidity.  The remaining 7.6 mil-
lion shares were issued by GM, and the proceeds
were used for general corporate purposes.
  Earnings (Loss) per share attributable to
Class H common stock were $2.30 in 1993,
($2.29) in 1992, and $1.39 in 1991, and are
based on the Available Separate Consolidated
Net Income (Loss) of GMHE (described in Note
9 to the Financial Statements).

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The return to overall profitability in 1993 resulted
in much stronger cash flow from operations
this year compared with the previous two years.
The Corporation's net losses in 1992 and 1991
had adverse effects on cash flow and balance
sheet strength during those periods.  Despite
negative business conditions during this period,


GM was able to meet its funding needs through
outside borrowings, sale of finance receivables,
equity issuances, sale of assets, sale and
leasebacks, and other means.
  In 1992 and 1991, GM's earnings were
inadequate to cover its fixed charges (principally
interest and related charges on debt), primarily
as a result of losses incurred by NAO.  The
Corporation is implementing fundamental changes
which it believes will restore the profitability of
those operations and enable the Corporation to
have earnings sufficient to cover its fixed charges,
as was the case in 1993.

Cash Flows

GM had its strongest cash position ever at
year-end.  Cash and cash equivalents, including
GMAC, were $13,790.5 million at December 31,
1993, up from $11,078.6 million a year earlier
due to net cash provided by operating and
investing activities exceeding net cash used in
financing activities.
  Cash and cash equivalents at December 31,
1993 with GMAC on an equity basis were
$9,762.5 million, up from $7,207.6 million a
year earlier.  The increase was due to an excess
of net cash provided by operating and investing
activities over net cash used in financing activities.
  Net cash provided by operating activities,
including GMAC, was $14,655.8 million in 1993.
$9,990.9 million in 1992, and $6,498.5 million
in 1991.  Net cash provided by operating activities
with GMAC on an equity basis was $11,406.3
million in 1993, $6,699.6 million in 1992, and
$4,674.9 million in 1991.
  The provisions for plant closings and other
restructurings represented $950.0 million, $1,237.0
million, and $2,820.8 million of noncash
charges to income in 1993, 1992, and 1991,
respectively.  The Corporation's plant closing and
restructuring reserve (excluding environmental)
at December 31, 1993 was $4,120.6 million.
Approximately $3,788.0 million of this total
represents employee job security and facility
holding costs which will require future cash
outflows, generally spread evenly over the next
six years.  Such cash flows will be influenced by
the Corporation's ability to manage its work force
efficiently and effectively within and across geo-
graphic areas during this period.  As a result of
the improved alignment of plant capacity and
market demand, the Corporation expects to
achieve improved operating results and cash flows.
  Net cash provided by (used in) investing
activities, including GMAC, was $457.4 mil-
lion in 1993, $1,542.8 million in 1992, and
($2,798.9) million in 1991.  GMAC received
$13,072.2 million in 1993, $11,201.8 million in
1992, and $2,926.9 million in 1991 from pro-
ceeds from sales of finance receivables.  Such
sales, which are an integral element in GMAC's
strategy to minimize liquidity concerns, acceler-
ate the conversion of receivables to cash.  With
GMAC on an equity basis, net cash provided by
investing activities amounted to $2,465.0 million

delivered to Perry would be diverted to the
Company's other Iowa plants. Among the
Company's alternatives is to take the
equipment in the Perry plant and use it in
the renovation of the recently purchased
pork plant at Logansport.
  Although the plant's closure would affect
the Company's capacity long-term, there
should be no near-term impact on total
Pork Division production levels. The
potential adverse impact on 1994 operating
earnings is not expected to be significant.
Whatever the outcome, stockholders can be
assured the financial performance of the
plant will either be significantly improved or
the plant closed.

International Sales

  The dramatic export growth that IBP has
experienced since the early 1980s contin-
ued in 1993.  Export sales increased by
8.2% over last year and represented 11.9%
of the Company's net sales.
  Despite weakness in the Japanese
economy, the Far East remained a major
contributor to IBP's success in the interna-
tional marketplace.  Export sales to that part
of the world were up 12% over 1992.
  Thanks to improved packaging technol-


ogy, we have been able to ship more
chilled instead of frozen beef and pork to
Japan.  Japan now accounts for more than
half of all U.S. beef, veal and variety meat
exports.  It is also the largest export market
for U.S. pork, accounting for two-thirds of
total export sales.
  Mexico continues to be a growing
market for U.S. meat products and
promises to get even better, thanks in part


resources have been expended for
employee training and medical manage-
ment programs, as well as improvements
in equipment design and workplace layout.
As a result, employees at IBP have a safer
work environment and IBP's cost of 
manufacturing is less.

New Board Members

 Dr. Wendy Lee Gramm and JoAnn
Doke Smith joined IBP's Board of Direc-
tors in 1993.

 Gramm has chaired the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, served as
Administrator for Information and 
Regulatory Affairs at the White House Office
of Management and Budget and directed
the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of
Economics.

 Smith is a former Assistant Secretary for
Marketing and Inspection Services for the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture and has 
served in numerous capacities in the
livestock industry, including President of
the National Cattlemen's Association.

 We suffered the loss of a great friend
and associate in January, 1994. Perry V.
Haines, IBP Executive Vice President and
Board member, died from cancer. We will

three months or less to be cash equivalents. Temporary
investments, which are carried at cost which approximates
market, were comprised primarily of variable-rate municipal
bonds and time deposits.

 Reclassifications
 
  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior financial
statements to conform to the current year presentation.

B. Inventories:
 Inventories are comprised of the following:


C. Credit Arrangements:

 IBP has a $250,000,000 senior revolving/term facility (the
Revolving/Term Facility) and a $125,000,000 short-term
revolving facility (the Short-Term Revolver). Both committed
facilities bear interest, at the Company's option, at varying rates
based upon the banks' base rates or an uncommitted bid
option. From time to time, IBP also uses uncommitted lines of
credit for some or all of its short-term borrowing needs.

 The Revolving/Term Facility is a revolving facility which may
be extended for one-year increments annually during the
revolving period with consent of the banks involved. The
revolving period has been extended through November 15, 
1994. At the end of the revolving period, any outstanding
borrowings are converted to a two-year credit facility with equal
quarterly payments. Commitment fees are .275 to .375 of 1%
on the bid option and the unused portion of the committed 
facility.

 The Short-Term Revolver may be extended semi-annually for
additional six-month periods with consent of the banks involved.
It has been extended through November 10, 1994. Commit-
ment fees are .125 to .25 of 1% on the unused portion of the
facility.

 Borrowings under the Revolving/Term Facility are treated as
current liabilities with the exception of $100,000,000 which IBP


does not intend to repay within one year. This amount is
classified as long-term in the consolidated balance sheet for
1993; the interest rate at December 25, 1993 on such borrow-
ings was 3.6%.

 During 1993, the maximum amount of short-term borrow-
ings under all of IBP's credit arrangements was $137,000,000.
Average short-term borrowings and the weighted average
interest rate during 1993 were $55,687,000 and 3.4%. At
December 25, 1993, total borrowings outstanding under 
committed facilities, including the $100,000,000 classified as
long-term, were $100,000,000 and the unused portion totaled
$275,000,000.

D. Accounts Payable and
Accrued Expenses:

 Accounts payable and accrued expenses are comprised of 
the following:


E. Income Taxes:

 Effective December 27, 1992, IBP adopted SFAS No. 109 on
a prospective basis. The cumulative effect of adopting this
statement was to increase net earnings by $12.6 million in fiscal
1993. SFAS No. 109 requires that prior accounting for business
combinations, such as IBP's application of "pushdown account-
ing" to its acquisition by Occidental in 1981, be adjusted to
reflect remaining assets at fair value rather than net-of-tax value
as under APB No. 11. Any difference between the adjusted 
remaining balance and the tax bases are accounted for as 
temporary differences. The cumulative effect of the accounting
change was an increase in property, plant and equipment of
$23.4 million, net of accumulated depreciation of $80.2


I. Financial Instruments:

 The following methods and assumptions are used in
estimating the fair value of each class of the Company's financial
instruments at December 25, 1993:
 
 For cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments,
accounts receivable and accounts payable, the carrying amount
is a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the short-term
nature of these instruments.

 For securities included in other assets, fair value is based
upon quoted market prices for these or similar securities. The
carrying amount approximates fair value for these securities.

The fair value of the Company's long-term debt is estimated
by discounting the future cash outlays associated with each debt
instrument using interest rates currently available to the 
Company for debt issues with similar terms and remaining
maturities.

 The estimated fair values of IBP's financial instruments as of
December 25, 1993, are as follows:


J. Commitments and Contingencies:

 IBP is involved in numerous disputes incident to the
ordinary course of its business. In the opinion of management,
any liability for which provision has not been made relative to 
the various lawsuits, claims and administrative proceedings
pending against IBP, including that described below, will not
have a material adverse effect on its financial position.

 A complaint filed against IBP in April 1988 by the Depart-
ment of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, in the United States
District Court in Kansas seeks injunctive relief and back wages,
plus interest, for certain hourly employees of the Company. The
case relates to compensation allegedly due for incidental 
activities of hourly employees before and after regular working
hours. In the liability phase of the case, the district judge has
ruled that IBP is required to pay back wages for a portion of the 
incidental activities. An appeal by the Company is in progress.
The Company's management believes it has made adequate 
provision for any liability, the amount of which, if any, will be 
determined at a later time.


The notes on pages 36 through 62 are an integral part of this statement.

K Research, Development and Engineering

Research, development and engineering expenses amounted to $ 5,558 million in 1993, $6,522 million in 
1992, and $6,644 million in 1991.

Included in these amounts were expenditures of $4,431 million in 1993, $5,083 million in 1992, and
$5,001 million in 1991 for a broad program of research and development activities covering basic scientific
research in a variety of fields and the application of scientific advances to the development of new and improved
products and their uses. Of these amounts, software-related activities were $1,097 million, $1,161 million,
and $994 million in 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively. In addition, expenditures for product-related engi-
neering amounted to $1,127 million, $1,439 million, and $1,643 million for the same three years.

L Restructuring Actions

The company has taken a series of actions since 1985 to streamline and reduce resources utilized in the
business. During 1993 and 1992, the company recorded restructuring charges of $8.9 billion before taxes
($8.0 billion after taxes or $14.02 per common share) and $11.6 billion before taxes ($8.3 billion after taxes or
$14.51 per common share), respectively. These charges are summarized in the table below:


During 1991, the company also recorded a restructuring charge of $3.7 billion before taxes ($2.9 billion after
taxes or $5.03 per common share). The actions contemplated in the 1991 charge were associated with work force
reductions and relocations, facility consolidations, and other related items, which have been essentially completed.

The company records restructuring charges against operations and provides a reserve based upon the best
information available at the time the decision is made to undertake the restructuring action. The reserves 
are subsequently utilized when specific restructuring criteria are met, indicating the planned restructuring
action has occurred. Work-force-related reserves are considered utilized at payment for either termination or
acceptance of other contractual arrangements. Manufacturing capacity reserves are considered utilized based
on execution of planned actions at each affected location. The reserve for excess space is utilized when the 
remaining lease obligations are settled, or the space has been vacated and subleased.

Why?

Cash Flow From Operations
International Paper continued to generate substantial cash
flow in 1993 despite lower operating earnings. However,
cash provided by operations of $929 million in 1993 was
below the $1.1 billion in 1992 and $1.2 billion in 1991.
During 1993, working capital increased $290 million, most
of which was from lower accounts payable and accrued lia-
bilities. An increase in depreciation and amortization
charges in 1993 to $898 million from $850 million in 1992
and $725 million in 1991 mitigated the effect of lower net 
earnings on cash flow.

Capital Expenditures by Industry Segment


Investment Activities
Capital spending of $954 million in 1993 was well below the
$1.4 billion and $1.2 billion spent in 1992 and 1991. This
reduced spending reflects completion of several major proj-
ects in late 1992 including Zanders' new paper machine for
the production of high-quality base papers and expansion of
Aussedat Rey's Saillat pulp mill.
 As in recent years, 1993 capital spending largely focused
on further reduction of production costs, plant upgrades
and incremental capacity expansions, quality and produc-
tivity improvements, and environmental and safety pro-

grams. During 1993, the project at Lock Haven, Pa.,to 
produce 100% recycled-paper grades from postconsumer
newspapers and magazines was completed and started
production late in the year. Also, one paper machine at
Kwidzyn, in Poland, was upgraded to improve productivity.
 Capital spending for 1994 is expected to exceed
$1.1 billion. Major projects will focus on printing papers
and packaging facilities. In the United States, the design
for a new, low-cost uncoated paper machine at the Riverdale
mill near Selma, Ala., was completed and the majority of 
spending for this project will occur during 1994. In Europe,
the $175 million capital investment program for Kwidzyn
will continue.
 Spending for acquisitions decreased substantially in
1993. In 1993, $35 million was spent and $22 million of
debt  was assumed to acquire certain assets of Los Angeles-
based Ingram Paper Company, a distributor of industrial
and fine writing papers, and the assets of Monsanto Com-
pany's Fome-Cor division, a manufacturer of polystyrene
foam boards. The Company also acquired the assets of JB
Papers, Inc., a paper distribution company located in Union,
N.J., by issuing 117,000 shares of Company common stock.
 In 1992, $153 million was spent and $30 million ac-
crued, principally for the acquisitions of Kwidzyn in Poland
and Western Pacific in Oregon. The Company also spent
$209 million to acquire an equity interest in Scitex, a world
leader in color electronic prepress systems.
 In 1991, $457 million was spent and $50 million of debt
assumed to acquire the Rhone Valley Packaging business,
Evergreen Packaging Equipment, Dillard Paper Company
and Scaldia Papier BV. A merger with Leslie Paper Company
and the formation of a joint venture to control 32% of Carter
Holt Harvey Limited were also completed in 1991.


Cash Flow From Operations


Return on Equity

Financing Activities
In 1993, the Company issued $600 million of long-term
debt as follows: in March, $200 million of debentures due in
2023; in October, $200 million of debentures due in 2023;
and in November, $200 million of debentures due in 2003.
The proceeds of all debentures were used mainly to reduce
short-term borrowings and secure favorable long-term inter-
est rates. Interest rate swaps were utilized to obtain the
equivalent of short-term rates during the first year of the
October and November financings.
 In 1992, taking advantage of low interest rates, the
Company increased short-term borrowings by $657 million
to, in part, retire $255 million of high-rate long-term debt.
Also, in January, 9.2 million shares of common stock were 
sold in a public offering yielding $650 million, and $200
million of 7~~~% notes due in 2007 were issued. These
proceeds were principally used to retire higher rate debt
outstanding at that time.
 Net borrowings were $994 million in 1991, principally
used to finance acquisitions and large capital projects.
 Common stock dividends per share were $.42 per quar-
ter ($1.68 on an annual basis) in 1993, 1992 and 1991.
Payments were $208 million in 1993, $206 million in 1992
and $186 million in 1991.

Capital Resource Outlook for 1994
Cash flow from operations is expected to be adequate to
meet internal capital expenditures, working capital and
dividend requirements. A strong balance sheet (debt to
capital ratio of 39% in 1993, up from 38% in 1992 and com-
parable with 39% in 1991) supporting an investment-grade
debt rating allows ready access to financial markets to take
advantage of external investment and favorable financing 
opportunities.


Other Financial Statement Items
Net interest expense increased to $310 million in 1993 from
$247 million in 1992 and down from $315 million in 1991.
1992's net interest benefited from tax-related interest in-
come and higher capitalized interest related to two major
European capital projects that are now completed.
 The effective tax rate for 1993 increased to 42% (37%
before the revaluation of deferred tax balances) of pre-tax
income compared with 31% in 1992 and 37% in 1991. The
adoption of SFAS No. 109 and the tax benefit at statutory
rates of the productivity improvement and other charges in 
1992 contributed to 1992's lower rate. The increase in the 
rate for 1993 results from the increase in the U. S. statutory
federal income tax rate of 1%, which also increased deferred
taxes by $25 million.
 During 1993, the Company recognized tax benefits
amounting to $55 million related to losses at certain of its
non-U.S. operations, increasing noncurrent deferred tax
assets to $115 million at December 31, 1993. The Company
believes that it is more likely than not that these assets will
be realized.

Environmental Issues
Given the nature of its businesses, International Paper is
closely linked to the environment. Increasingly demanding
environmental laws and regulations have resulted in signifi-
cant capital spending to meet or exceed air, water and solid
waste disposal standards. Environmental capital expendi-
tures totaled  $100 million in 1993, $126 million in 1992 and
$107 million in 1991. Capital spending to increase recycling
capacity totaled $102 million, $35 million and $5 million
in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

KEY PRODUCTS IN CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT

which reduced Net income by $29.6 million on an after-tax
basis.  The effect of this change on 1992 Income before
cumulative effect of accounting changes was not material.
  In May 1993, Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, was issued which
requires adoption in 1994.  This Statement requires certain
investments in debt and equity securities to be reported at
fair value.  The effects on the Company's results are not
expected to be material.
  The Company believes that it is in compliance in all
material respects with applicable environmental laws and
regulations.  The Company has maintained a leadership
role in supporting environmental initiatives and fostering
pollution prevention by actions including the elimination of,
or the application of best available technology to, air
emissions of known or suspect carcinogens at its facilities
worldwide and a project currently underway to reduce all
environmental releases of toxic chemicals by 90% by 1995.
In 1993, the Company incurred capital expenditures of
approximately $122.4 million for environmental control
facilities.  Capital expenditures for this purpose are forecasted
to exceed $400.0 million for the years 1994 through 1998.
In addition, the Company's operating and maintenance
expenditures for pollution control were approximately $40.0
million in 1993.  Expenditures for this purpose for the years
1994 through 1998 are forecasted to exceed $200.0 million.
The Company is a party to a number of proceedings brought
under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as
Superfund, as well as under other Federal and state statutes.
While it is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of
these proceedings, management does not believe that they
should ultimately result in a materially adverse effect on the
Company's financial position, results of operations, liquidity
or capital resources.  The Company is also remediating
environmental contamination resulting from past industrial
activity at certain of its sites.  Expenditures for environmental
purposes were $26.3 million in 1993, and are estimated at
$170.0 million for the years 1994 through 1998.  The Company
has taken an active role in identifying and providing for these
costs; and, therefore, management does not believe that these
expenditures should ultimately result in a materially adverse
effect on the Company's financial position, results of
operations, liquidity or capital resources.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
In 1993, capital expenditures were $1.0 billion compared to
$1.1 billion in 1992.  Expenditures in the United States were
$759.7 million in 1993 and $784.0 million in 1992.  Expenditures
during 1993 included $260.1 million for research and
development facilities, $218.5 million for production facilities,
$136.5 million for safety and environmental projects and


They're larger than the U.S. economy, and our penetration of these
economies is significantly lower.
  During the year, we continued our strong growth in the Asia Pacific
area and in Latin America.  Sales volume of our 12 companies in Asia
outside Japan grew about 40 percent.  In Latin America, unit volume
grew more than 20 percent.
  In Europe, we completed the transition from country-focused organiza-
tions to business-centered units.  This new way of operating is speeding up
decision-making, increasing efficiency and sharpening our customer focus.
  We also formed an organization to capitalize on growth opportunities
in Eastern Europe, the Mideast and Central Asia -~ an area encompassing
more than 40 countries and 750 million people.

~ Customer Satisfaction
We want customers to prefer 3M by a wide margin over our competitors.
This means being the best not only in product quality and value, but in
everything we do -~ from ease of ordering to accuracy of deliveries.
  During the year, we continued to make major investments in customer-
friendly systems for order entry, distribution and invoicing.

~ Productivity Improvement
To meet our financial goals and stay competitive, we're putting strong
emphasis on productivity improvement.  This means:
  ~ Getting the most out of every R&D dollar we spend.
  ~ Lowering manufacturing costs through reductions in cycle time,
waste and energy usage.
  ~ Maintaining tight control of capital spending.
  ~ Improving marketing efficiency.
  ~ Streamlining organizational structure.
  ~ Eliminating activities that don't add value for customers.
  During the year, our 6 percent volume gain was accomplished with
about 1,125 fewer people.  We have now reduced employment, largely
through attrition, by about 3,650 on a comparable basis over the last
three years.  This has been done while maintaining strong employee
commitment and motivation.

~ Outlook for 1994
Many economists expect a pickup in global economic growth, espe-
cially in the second half of the year.  A stronger economy, combined
with a steady stream of new products and ongoing efforts to improve
productivity, will help our results.  However, the pricing environment
is likely to remain quite competitive and currency fluctuations could
have a significant, negative effect on our results again this year.
  Given all of this, we look for a reasonable increase in 1994 earnings,
along with a continued strong financial position.

  3M continues to build on its impressive base in adhesives with
innovations in technology and even closer relationships with cus-
tomers.  Major growth opportunities include:
  ~ Next-generation structural adhesives, which are used in con-
struction and manufacturing.  As manufacturers use more synthetic
materials, such as plastics and composites, adhesives will play an
even greater role.  Over the coming years, much of the growth in 3M's
adhesives business will come through the replacement of traditional
fastening systems, such as rivets, welds, nuts and bolts.
  ~ Flexible adhesives, used in laminations and veneers.
  ~ Film adhesives, used in auto and aerospace manufacturing.
  ~ Improved hot-melt adhesives, which are safer for the environ-
ment because they contain no solvents.


  3M's success as a supplier of specialty adhesives demands that
the company work closely with customers, understanding their needs
and the materials they use.  Today, we help customers solve problems
with their current products, and we help them design for the future.
For the aerospace industry, the company is working on adhesives for
the next generation of airplanes.  3M is also developing products for
the computer industry, where product offerings change rapidly.
  3M's global presence is a major competitive advantage.  Customers
want a supplier that can meet their needs worldwide.  3M is ready,
virtually anywhere in the world, to provide not only the products they
need, but also technical support and worker training.
  In Europe, 3M has strengthened its position in box-sealing and
masking tapes, large and growing market segments.
  In the Asia Pacific area, markets are opening rapidly.  3M has
recently built or expanded adhesives manufacturing operations in
Japan, Korea, Australia, India and China.
  In Latin America, the company is already the leading tape
manufacturer in such major markets as Brazil and Mexico and is
extending its reach throughout the region.
  In Canada, a new tape plant in Ontario began operation in 1993.
It is expected to be 3M's most efficient plant for producing general-
purpose masking tapes.
  A tradition of customer service, an unmatched technology base
and a global presence help ensure that 3M will continue to be a world
leader in adhesives technology.

focus, the operation produced little manufacturing waste.
  As the pads were being manufactured, 3M marketers continued
their research, which showed that consumers preferred the Never Rust
soap pad by more than two to one compared with steel wool.  At the
same time, marketers refined their plans for packaging, distribution
and sales support.  Four-, eight- and 14-count packages would be
available through grocery stores, mass merchandisers, convenience
stores, hardware stores, drug stores and membership-club stores. In
another environmentally sensitive move, the soap pad's eye-catching
boxes were made from 100 percent recycled paper.
  To support the launch, 3M drew distributors into the effort, soliciting
input on displays and promotions.  Television advertising, newspaper
inserts, coupons, free samples and an extensive public relations effort
were also developed to increase consumer awareness and promote sales.
  3M's strategic objective of increasing market penetration outside
the United States meant that Never Rust soap pads were destined to
travel.  The international marketing plan, developed simultaneously
with the U.S. plan, had a twofold objective: capture share in markets
such as Brazil, where steel wool pads have a large consumer base, and
attract new consumers in places such as Japan, where steel wool is not
commonly used.  Never Rust pads were introduced simultaneously in
the United States, Canada, Colombia and New Zealand, then in other
countries in Latin America and the Far East.  Tracking studies show
that Never Rust pads have successfully attracted new buyers to the


product category, while strong demand for other Scotch-Brite prod-
ucts has been maintained.
  After one of the most successful product launches in 3M history,
the Never Rust team didn't rest on its laurels.  Following a typical 3M
pattern, they continued their work on parallel tracks: streamlining
production to improve efficiency and initiating development of the
product's next generation.
  In January 1994, 3M introduced Scotch-BriteTM Never ScratchTM
Wool Soap Pads.  Addressing another limitation of steel wool, Never
Scratch pads provide effective cleaning power for nonstick cookware,
china and other delicate surfaces.  Additional products based on this
technology are under development.
  Meanwhile, the technology breakthrough in the Never Rust pad
has already found application in other 3M product lines.  For example,
Never Rust commercial floor polisher pads, also made from recycled
plastic, offer a better way to clean marble floors.

operating costs were partially
offset by modestly higher net pric-
ing (principally at domestic KFC)
and increased franchise royalty
revenues.  Domestic profits rose
$87 million or 15%, while inter-
national profits declined $28 mil-
lion or 23% reflecting weakness
in Australia.
  Pizza Hut's worldwide sales
increased $525 million or 15%
to $4.1 billion.  The domestic
operations represent the major
portion of worldwide Pizza Hut.
Additional units contributed $392
million to the worldwide sales
increase.  Volume growth provided
about $140 million, driven by
strong domestic gains resulting
from the national rollout of the
new value-priced Bigfoot Pizza in
the second quarter.
  Comparable sales for domestic
company-owned units (same
store sales) advanced 5%, though
volume growth was slightly
higher.  This performance
reflected growth in all three
distribution channels: delivery,
carryout and dine-in.  Improved
sales in both delivery and carryout
were driven by the success of
Bigfoot.  The growth in dine-in
reflected the impact of the third
quarter 1992 rollout of the
all-you-can-eat pizza and salad
lunch buffet.  Results late in 1993
indicate a softening of same
store sales trends in dine-in due
primarily to lapping last year's
rollout of the lunch buffet.
  Pizza Hut's worldwide profits
advanced $37 million or 11%
to $372 million.  This profit per-
formance reflected about $55 mil-
lion from volume growth, $41
million from additional units,
increased franchise royalty reve-
nues and higher international net
pricing.  These benefits were par-
tially offset by increased store
operating costs as well as admin-
istrative and support expenses,
which included the start-up
costs associated with Bigfoot.
Bigfoot contributed significantly
to U.S. profit growth as incre-
mental volume, net of estimated
cannibalization of other products,


Restaurant Family Tree
PepsiCo company-owned, joint
venture, franchised and licensed restaurants
are in 88 countries and territories.  PFS is our
restaurant supply company.

For PepsiCo's key international operations, located in Australia,
Canada, Japan, Mexico, Spain and the United Kingdom (U.K.),
the translation effects of exchange rate movements on earnings
have historically been largely offsetting.  The effects on com-
parability of sales and operating profits arising from translation
of the income statements of international businesses are identi-
fied, where material, in Management's Analysis of consolidated
and segment operating results.  These translation effects exclude
the impact of businesses in highly inflationary countries, where
the functional currency is the U.S. dollar.
  Changes in currency exchange rates also result in foreign
exchange gains and losses, reported as a component of unallo-
cated expenses, net (see page 28).  For 1993, 1992 and 1991, net
foreign exchange losses totaled $41.2 million, $17.4 million and
$7.8 million, respectively.  These reported amounts include net
translation losses arising from remeasurement into U.S. dollars
of the net monetary assets of businesses in highly inflationary
countries, as well as net transaction losses.  Cash flow transaction
gains and losses arise from current assets such as receivables
and short-term investments as well as payables (including debt)
denominated in currencies other than a business' functional cur-
rency.  In implementing strategies to minimize financing costs,
the effects of expected currency exchange rate movements on
debt and short-term investments are considered along with
related interest rates in measuring effective net financing costs.
  Beginning in 1993, Mexico is no longer categorized as highly
inflationary.  PepsiCo has not calculated the net foreign exchange
loss that would have been reported in 1993 had businesses in
Mexico been accounted for as highly inflationary; however,
translation losses for businesses in Mexico were not a significant
component of the above 1992 and 1991 amounts.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


(tabular dollars in millions except per share amounts)
Note 1 -~ Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Significant accounting policies are discussed below, and where
applicable, in the Notes that follow.
  Principles of Consolidation.  The financial statements
reflect the consolidated accounts of PepsiCo, Inc. and its con-
trolled affiliates.  Intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated.  Investments in affiliates in which PepsiCo exer-
cises significant influence but not control are accounted for by
the equity method, and the equity in net income is included in
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated
Statement of Income.  Certain other reclassifications were made
to prior year amounts to conform with the 1993 presentation.
  Marketing Costs.  Marketing costs are reported in Selling,
general and administrative expenses and include costs of adver-
tising, marketing and promotional programs.  Promotional
discounts are expensed as incurred, and other marketing costs
not deferred are charged to expense ratably in relation to
sales over the year in which incurred.  Marketing costs deferred
consist of media and personal service advertising prepayments,
materials in inventory and production costs of future media
advertising; these assets are expensed in the year used.
  Cash Equivalents.  Cash equivalents represent funds
temporarily invested (with original maturities not exceeding
three months) as part of PepsiCo's management of day-to-day
operating cash receipts and disbursements.  All other investment
portfolios, primarily held outside the U.S., are classified as short-
term investments.
  Net Income Per Share.  Net income per share is computed
by dividing net income by the weighted average number of
shares and share equivalents outstanding during each year.
  Research and Development Expenses.  Research and
development expenses, which are expensed as incurred, were
$113 million, $102 million and $99 million in 1993, 1992 and
1991, respectively.

Note 2 -~ Business Segments
Information regarding industry segments and geographic areas
of operations is provided on pages 27 through 29.

Note 3 -~ Unusual Items
In 1993, PepsiCo recorded a charge of $29.9 million ($0.04 per
share) to increase its net deferred tax liabilities, as required by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 (SFAS 109),
"Accounting for Income Taxes," for the 1% statutory rate
increase under U.S. tax legislation enacted in 1993.  (See Note 13.)
  Unusual charges, principally for restructurings, totaled
$193.5 million in 1992 ($128.5 million after-tax or $0.16 per
share) and $170.0 million in 1991 ($119.8 million after-tax
or $0.15 per share).  In 1992, PepsiCo adopted the Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 (SFAS 106), "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions"
and SFAS 109 effective December 29, 1991.  (See Notes 10 and 13.)
As compared to the previous accounting methods, the adoption
of SFAS 106 and SFAS 109 reduced 1992 operating profit by
$72.8 million ($19.3 million after-tax or $0.02 per share).  Infor-
mation regarding the effect of these actions on comparability
of operating profits is provided on page 27.

  The 1991 amounts above were calculated under the previous
accounting method.  The 1991 deferred provision arose prin-
cipally from accelerated expense recognition for tax purposes
as compared to financial reporting and included amounts related
to depreciation of property, plant and equipment of $56.2 mil-
lion, amortization of intangibles of $49.0 million and increased
prefunding of employee benefits of $23.3 million, partially offset
by $41.7 million related to restructuring charges.
  Tax benefits associated with exercises of stock options totaled
$23.4 million in 1993, $57.5 million in 1992 and $8.5 million in
1991.  These amounts were credited to shareholders' equity.  A
change in the functional currency of operations in Mexico from
the U.S. dollar to local currency in 1993 resulted in a $19.3 mil-
lion decrease in the net deferred foreign tax liability that was
credited to shareholders' equity.
  U.S. and foreign income before income taxes and cumulative
effect of accounting changes:


Detail of the 1993 and 1992 deferred tax liabilities (assets):


  The valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets rose by
$67.7 million in 1993 and $38.5 million in 1992, which offset
higher deferred tax assets arising primarily from increased net
operating loss carryforwards.  The net operating loss carryfor-
wards largely relate to a number of foreign and state jurisdictions
and expire over a range of dates.
  The deferred tax liability for Safe Harbor Leases (the Leases)
is related to transactions, which PepsiCo entered into in 1981
and 1982, that decreased income taxes paid by PepsiCo over the
initial years of the Leases and are now increasing taxes payable.
Additional taxes paid in 1993 related to the Leases totaled
$6.4 million, and taxes payable are estimated to be $40.5 million
over the next five years.  The provision for income taxes is not
impacted by the Leases.
  Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognized for bases
differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries
and joint ventures.  These differences, which consist primarily
of unremitted earnings intended to be indefinitely reinvested,
aggregated approximately $3.2 billion at year-end 1993 and
$2.4 billion at year-end 1992, exclusive of amounts that if
remitted in the future would result in little or no tax under
current tax laws and the Puerto Rico tax incentive grant. Deter-
mination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities
is not practicable.


  Exploration and Production's business strategy is based on several key goals.
  First, E&P is working to increase the value of its assets by adding oil and
  natural gas reserves over the long term at competitive costs. Improving
profitability through stronger cash flow and continuing to improve on E&P's strong
safety and environmental performance are also "fundamental to increasing
shareholder value -~ a commitment we have made at Phillips," says John Whitmire,
E&P executive vice president.
  "Our future depends on how well we manage our business," Whitmire says.  "What
we're after is a value-oriented approach in everything we do.  Our goal is not simply to
find oil and natural gas ... it's to find and develop these resources in a way that
generates significant value over the long term."


Earnings Increase
Net income increased 5 percent, to $386
million, in 1993.  The increase was mainly
due to higher U.S. natural gas sales prices
and gains from asset sales, along with
lower worldwide production costs and
depreciation charges.  Partly offsetting
these positive trends were lower crude oil
sales prices and volumes, and foreign cur-
rency losses, versus gains a year ago.

Capital Expenditures Higher
Capital expenditures were up significantly
in 1993 -~ to $819 million versus $583
million  in 1992 -~ as work began on sev-
eral important developments scheduled to
begin production in the mid-1990s.  These
include development of the Judy/Joanne
fields in the United Kingdom (U.K.)
North Sea and the Xijiang project off-
shore China, among others.  E&P capital
expenditures (representing nearly 70 per-
cent of Phillips' total) included two new
tankers for the company's liquefied natur-
al gas (LNG) operations in Kenai, Alaska.
These tankers were subsequently sold
during the year and leased back to
Phillips.

Emphasis on Value, Reserves Growth
E&P's four operating divisions -~ North
America, Norway, U.K. and International
-~ are pursuing value in project selection
and at each stage of the exploration and
production cycle.  Says Whitmire: "We


are making new discoveries and accelerat-
ing development efforts.  As a result, our
projects are becoming profitable sooner."
  Phillips is also working to achieve
stronger performance from existing
assets, focusing on those that offer strong
profit margins, growth potential or strate-
gic positioning.  "If an asset is not adding
value, we'll sell it or trade it for one that
will -~ increasing the value of Phillips'
holdings," Whitmire says.

Several Assets Sold
Several non-strategic E&P assets were
sold in 1993, including Phillips' interest
in the Harriet field, offshore western
Australia; the Kakap field in Indonesia;
the Waalwijk gas field in the Netherlands;
production operations in western Egypt;
and properties in North America.  For the
year, proceeds from asset sales (excluding
the LNG tankers) totaled $176 million.

Reserves Replacement Strong
Technology continues to play an impor-
tant role in replacing reserves -~ helping
Phillips increase oil and natural gas
recovery from mature fields and identify
reserves in complex geological structures.
Phillips replaced 104 percent of its world-
wide production on a barrel-of-oil-equiva-
lent (BOE) basis in 1993, and 147 percent
of U.S. production.  Over the last five


Earnings Move Higher
Net income rose 83 percent in 1993, to
$75 million.  The increase was mainly
due to the sale of Phillips' fibers opera-
tions and improved ethylene margins.
These items were partly offset by contin-
uing low margins in the polyethylene
line and a writedown associated with the
company's decision to exit the catalyst
business.

Capital Spending Levels Off
After several years of high capital expen-
ditures on new polyethylene facilities at
HCC and a major ethylene unit at the
Sweeny, Texas, facility, spending
declined 35 percent in 1993, to about
$162 million. Expenditures went for a
new catalyst plant (which is being sold),
and several projects at HCC, including a
major upgrade of polypropylene opera-
tions, a new plant water system and con-
struction of an office building.


HDPE Production, Quality Improve
HCC's production of high-density poly-
ethylene (HDPE) was up more than 50
percent in 1993, as sales approached lev-
els that existed before a 1989 accident
destroyed the company's domestic
capacity.
  Polyethylene production at HCC con-
tinued to move toward full capacity (1.8
billion pounds annually) during the first
half of the year. But with low prices and
margins, the decision was made to stabi-
lize production and sales volumes at
about 1.4 billion pounds a year to control
product inventories.  To boost revenues,
Phillips increased its prices for polyeth-
ylene and polypropylene, and the quality
of HDPE was improved.
  In the future, Phillips plans to con-
tinue participating in the fast-growing
Asian market, supplying polyethylene
from HCC and its Singapore facility,
where an expansion will double the

3.2 billion pounds a year.  The plant also
increased capacity for propylene, a feed-
stock for polypropylene plastics.  As
building-block chemicals, olefins are
vital to Phillips' chain of integration -~
the ability to upgrade the value of raw
materials.

Aromatics:  Aromatics and cyclics results
benefited in 1993 from higher sales vol-
umes and reduced feedstock costs.  This
helped offset lower sales prices for
cyclohexane (a feedstock for nylon) and
paraxylene (a feedstock for polyester).
Aromatics are produced at Borger,
Sweeny and Puerto Rico, and are sold to
outside customers.  Phillips is the world's
leading cyclohexane producer, with 70
percent of U.S. capacity and 14 percent
worldwide.

Specialties:  The specialty chemicals
business remained a steady income pro-
ducer in 1993, thanks to higher sales vol-
umes for sulfur chemicals produced at
the Borger, Texas, and Tessenderlo,
Belgium, plants.
  At Tessenderlo, production of poly-
sulfides (used in lubricant additives)
began in 1993, opening the door to new
markets.  In the U.S., sales were higher
for Borger-produced isobutylbenzene, a
feedstock for the pain reliever ibuprofen.
Sales were also up for oil field chemicals
manufactured at Phillips' Conroe, Texas,
plant.  This was mainly due to increased
exploration and production activity in the
Gulf of Mexico.

Polyethylene/Polypropylene:  Although
sales volumes for polyethylene were up
for the year, overcapacity in the market
kept prices and margins low.  Results for
polypropylene were down, compared
with 1992, due to a major renovation of
manufacturing facilities at HCC, which
limited production.

Pipe Operations:  Phillips Driscopipe,
Inc. achieved record sales volumes and
brought in higher earnings for the year.
Driscopipe, based in Richardson, Texas,
is the nation's largest supplier of poly-
ethylene pipe.  Sales of gas distribution
pipe brought in the highest margins, and
sales were up for water and sewer lines.
Driscopipe also introduced a new prod-


uct -~ Opticore -~ during the year.  Used
for water and sewer applications,
Opticore is unique in that it is white on
the inside (rather than black), allowing
customers to check the condition of the
buried pipe with fiber-optic cameras.

K-Resin: Thanks to higher sales in 1993,
K-Resin was the top earnings producer
in the plastics line and set a new produc-
tion record.  This tough, clear plastic is
used to make products such as toys, dis-
posable cups and shower doors.  Recent
product improvements are opening new
markets for K-Resin, such as food and
medical packaging.

Engineering Plastics:  Stronger demand
and new applications for Ryton engineer-
ing plastics pushed sales higher in 1993.
Overcapacity in the market, however,
lowered prices and margins.  Ryton's
1993 results were lower than the year
before, mainly because 1992 earnings
benefited from an asset sale.  Ryton


(polyphenylene sulfide) is the brand
name for Phillips' high-performance,
heat- and chemical-resistant resins and
compounds.  Ryton is used to manufac-
ture electrical or electronic components
and under-the-hood automotive parts.

New Products Expand Plastics Market
Phillips is working to develop new prod-
ucts and processes -~ or upgrade exist-
ing ones -~ to bring in higher margins.
The company completed development of
new high-flow injection molding resins
in 1993, aimed at the thin-walled con-
tainer market.  Because these resins have
very low odor and taste, they work well
for food packaging, such as margarine
tubs, yogurt containers and plastic cups.
The company is also evaluating an
improved HDPE blow molding resin
used to make containers for household
and industrial chemicals, such as bleach
and detergent.


The decrease in operating income for 1993 resulted from lower
crude oil sales prices and volumes, lower natural gas production,
and higher exploration expenses, primarily from dry hole charges
for wells drilled on the Sunfish, Kuvlum and Wild Weasel
prospects in Alaska.  Partially offsetting these negative factors
were 19 percent higher natural gas sales prices.
  U.S. crude oil and natural gas production was lower in 1993,
compared with 1992, primarily due to normal declines in produc-
tion from mature fields.  The decline in crude production was
partly offset by increased production from the Point Arguello
field, offshore California.
  The increase in operating income from 1991 to 1992 was pri-
marily due to higher natural gas sales prices, lower exploration
expenses and lifting costs, and tax credits for producing fuel from
a nonconventional source related to the company's San Juan
Basin natural gas production.  These positive factors were partly
offset by lower sales prices for crude oil and liquefied natural gas.
  Special items in 1993 included a $5 million after-tax refund of
windfall profit taxes.  The $11 million in special items in 1992
included after-tax asset-sale gains of $19 million, which were
more than offset by a natural gas imbalance accrual adjustment


Operating income increased for 1993, compared with 1992,
because of lower lifting costs and exploration expenses, partially
offset by lower crude oil and natural gas sales prices and vol-
umes.  Lifting costs were lower in 1993 partly due to a stronger
dollar against the kroner in the company's Norwegian opera-
tions.  Exploration expenses were lower primarily due to lower
dry hole expenses in Canada, Norway and other foreign coun-
tries.
  Foreign crude oil production was down in 1993, compared
with 1992, primarily because of the sale of producing properties
in Indonesia and Australia, as well as lower production in the
United Kingdom sector of the North Sea.  Partially offsetting the
production decline was the 1993 start-up of Embla field produc-
tion in the Ekofisk area.
  Natural gas production was down in 1993, due mainly to
lower demand.  The lower output was partially offset by higher
production in the United Kingdom, aided by the Ann gas field,
which came on stream in October 1993.
  The decrease in operating income from 1991 to 1992 resulted
from lower sales prices for crude oil and natural gas, along with
a decline in crude oil sales volumes.  Crude oil production was
down in 1992, compared with 1991, due to lower production in
Indonesia and the United Kingdom, coupled with the sale of pro-
ducing properties in Argentina late in the fourth quarter of 1991.
Natural gas production was up in 1992, compared with 1991, pri-
marily from higher production in Norway.
  Special items in 1993 included after-tax asset-sale gains of
$26 million, while special items in 1992 included after-tax for-
eign currency gains of $30 million.  Special items in 1991
included after-tax asset-sale gains of $78 million, partially offset
by after-tax foreign currency losses of $29 million.

Gas and Gas Liquids


acquisition of VP-Schickedanz.  This
is the Company's first move into the
tissue business outside North
America.  VPS has an experienced
organization with modern manufac-
turing facilities and high quality,
profitable brands such as Tempo, the
leading European paper handker-
chief, and Bess bath tissue, the lead-
ing brand in Germany.  Based on
proven technology and successful
brands in the U.S., along with sig-
nificant growth potential in a market
where per capita tissue usage is well
below U.S. levels, we expect to signif-
icantly build this business over time.

~ Eastern Europe continued its
strong growth with volume up 20%
in 1993/94.  Laundry detergents are
the Company's largest business in
this region.  P&G is the market leader
in the Czech and Slovak Republics,
with brands such as Tix, Tide and
Ariel.  In Russia, Tide is the best-sell-
ing western laundry detergent after
only six months on the market.
  Pampers is the number one diaper
in Hungary and Poland and is a
strong second in the Czech and Slovak
Republics.  P&G also strengthened its
dentifrice business in 1993/94.


Blend-a-Med is the number one den-
tifrice brand in Hungary and Poland.

~ Asia/Pacific recorded 25% vol-
ume growth, led by gains in China,
Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, Korea,
Indonesia, Thailand and India.
  Japan remains the largest business
in Asia/Pacific and set new volume
records, despite a tough competitive
climate and weak economic condi-
tions.  The introduction of the new
Vidal Sassoon hair care line was
a major factor in the broad-based
growth in this region.  Feminine
protection products were also an
important contributor.
  China was the fastest-growing
country in the region.  P&G
is China's market leader in hair care
and, with the completion of three
joint ventures during this fiscal year,
is now the largest detergent manufac-
turer in China, as well.  Our other
Chinese businesses -~ Skin Care,
Feminine Protection and Personal
Cleansing -~ are also growing.

~ Latin America continued broad-
based volume growth.  Mexico deliv-
ered the biggest volume gains on
existing businesses, while acquisitions
played an important role in the growth
of other Latin American markets.
  The Company strengthened its
position in the feminine protection
category with the acquisition of the
Higibras/ProHigiene companies in
Brazil.  In addition, we expanded our
core laundry and dishwashing business
through acquisition of the Quimica
and Llauro companies in Argentina.

~ Canada continued to build its
Laundry and Cleaning business
with the introduction of Tide with
Advanced Color Guard.  Paper led
Canada in unit volume growth as
P&G's technologies were applied to
the Royale bath tissue, kitchen towel
and facial tissue products.


See accompanying Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements.


  The estimated unrealized losses shown above represent the incremental charge to earnings to
immediately settle all interest rate swaps.  However, it is the Company's current intention to
leave these instruments outstanding until maturity over various periods extending to the year
2004, in which case no incremental charge to earnings will be realized.

Currency Instruments
The Company is subject to market rate risk from exposure to changes in currency exchange rates
primarily in three areas:  commercial transactions, intercompany financings and net investments
in foreign subsidiaries.
  The primary purpose of the Company's foreign currency hedging activities is to protect
against the risk that local currency cash flows associated with purchase transactions will be
adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.  Although this foreign currency exposure is
managed locally, corporate policy prescribes the range of hedging activity into which the
subsidiary operations may enter.  To execute this policy, the Company utilizes forward exchange
contracts and options with durations of generally less than twelve months.  The impact of
changes in the value of these instruments typically offsets changes in the value of the underlying
transactions.  For accounting purposes, gains and losses on option contracts that hedge
identifiable anticipated transactions and on forward contracts that hedge firm commitments are
included in the measurement of the related transaction.  Gains and losses on instruments used
for other purposes are recognized currently.
  The Company manages its foreign exchange exposure associated with intercompany
financing transactions primarily using foreign currency swaps.  Gains and losses on such
instruments mitigate the impact on earnings of currency exchange rate changes on the
underlying transactions.
  The impact of net asset exposures related to investments in foreign subsidiaries are managed
primarily through local currency financing, and by foreign currency denominated debt issued
by the parent company.  As discussed in the interest rate instruments section, the Company has
also entered into currency interest rate swaps, which effectively convert the principal and
interest cash flows of certain existing debt to foreign currency obligations.  The currency
translation associated with these obligations is designated as a hedge of the net investment in
the foreign subsidiaries and reflected in the currency translation adjustment in shareholders'
equity.
  Currency instruments outstanding at June 30, 1994 were as follows:


  The company's businesses apart from
domestic tobacco posted strong sales and
earnings growth.  Our international tobacco
and worldwide continuing food businesses,
combined, posted net sales up 9 percent
and operating income up 14 percent.
  Our worldwide food businesses had
robust performance in 1993.  Amid a slug-
gish environment for food businesses, we
managed to have another record year for
new products.  We expanded our success-
ful SnackWell's line of reduced-fat and non-
fat cookies and crackers, completed a
national roll-out of Gummi Savers candy,
introduced new nut products that moved
Planters into the broader snack arena,
developed a convenient, refrigerated ver-
sion of our category-leading Egg Beaters,
and strengthened our cookie leadership
with new Chunky Chips Ahoy! and fruit
Newtons varieties.  Our international food
business grew sales by 25 percent, with
strong growth in Latin America and entry
into Spain and Portugal.  Those are only the
highlights.  There are many, many others.
  Worldwide, our tobacco volume was
up 9 percent from a year ago as a result of
continued growth in international markets.
Although sales and earnings declined over-
all as a result of U.S. pricing, we saw real
indications by year's end of returning
stability in the domestic market that should
enable us to improve profits significantly
from last year's performance.  Over the
past five years, our international tobacco
business has grown volume faster than
any other company in the industry.  We will
build on that record with additional invest-
ments and expansion in recently entered
markets in Eastern Europe as well as in
other markets.  And domestic tobacco still
delivered more cash flow than virtually any
other type of consumer product in the
marketplace, with operating profit margins
still among the most attractive in the pack-
aged-goods business.


  We unified our domestic and interna-
tional tobacco and food businesses into two
worldwide organizations last year.  We
believe the new organizations will be better
able to compete effectively on a global
basis, bringing greater marketing clout and
technology to new markets and realizing
greater efficiency and shareholder returns.

Significant Investable Funds

  Our food and tobacco businesses form
the base for our growth plans, which
depend on running our existing businesses
as competitively and profitably as possible
and investing in new businesses that meet
our return objective.  That investment
requires cash, which, fortunately, we can
generate in large quantities over time.
  For example, in 1993, despite the pres-
sures in the domestic tobacco business,
RJR Nabisco delivered $1.03 billion of free
cash flow, which was well in excess of
most of our consumer-products peer
companies.  In addition, we spent
$615 million on capital investments last
year.  So, in total, we generated $1.65 billion
of investable funds last year.  We used
some of those funds to pay down debt,
which we'll continue to do until we reach
our capitalization target.  The rest of the
funds we invested in new projects to grow
future earnings.  Those projects -~ expan-
sions of manufacturing capacity for high-
demand products and acquisitions of inter-
ests in new companies such as Royal Brands
of Spain -~ promise returns on investment
that will enhance shareholder value.

Managing Short-Term Issues

  We confronted a number of headline-
grabbing issues last year -~ tobacco prices
and potential excise taxes among them -~
that will continue to be important to the
company.  But, nonetheless, in the broader
context of building shareholder wealth,
they are short-term issues.  Successful


(*before net charges in 1992 and 1993)


rebound in the third and fourth quarters.
  The third-quarter introduction of Select
Lights helped the Winston brand increase one
full share point and generate considerable
incremental volume in the fourth quarter.
  Select and the Winston brand family con-
ducted highly successful "relationship market-
ing" programs in 1993. Special offers carefully
aligned to Winston smokers' interests -~ the
Winston Winners Club and Winston Week-
ends promotions -~ let Reynolds efficiently
add value to the brand, without the "scatter-
shot" approach some traditional cigarette
marketing programs have used.
  Camel Special Lights' introduction in the
second quarter also helped retain full-price
smokers for R.J. Reynolds, with its specific
formulation designed to appeal to the taste
preferences of smokers of competing brands.
Camel benefited from strong advertising and
promotions, particularly Camel Cash, a
branded-merchandise program which draws
more than 30 percent of its participants from
competitive brands -~ smokers who switched
to Camel to participate in the program.  The
program increases the equity of the brand's
image and drives volume more efficiently than
many other forms of promotion.
  In October, the Camel brand began its first
sponsorship of motorsports racing teams.
The "Smokin' Joe's Racing" teams will extend
the brand's equity among racing fans, who


demonstrate extraordinary brand loyalty to race
sponsors.  Via its highly successful Winston
Cup sponsorship, Winston has long benefited
from this brand loyalty among racing fans.
  The Winston Select, Camel Cash and
motorsports racing teams programs are
examples of the highly efficient, cost-
effective, focused marketing approaches that
Reynolds will emphasize in the future for its
full-price brands.
  In 1993, R.J. Reynolds remained a leader in
the savings segment of the market.  Reynolds's
share of the savings segment declined in the
second half of the year as the company strove
to increase margins in the category.
  Several other efforts already underway in
1993 will pay off for the company long-term.
One was the installation of MARLIN, a market-
based research tool that provides accurate,
store-by-store scanner data linked to sales and
promotions.  By identifying which retail offers
and promotional vehicles work best, MARLIN
will maximize the cost-effectiveness of every
marketing and sales dollar.
  R.J. Reynolds has long had an outstanding
sales force.  In 1993, mindful of the need to
rationalize costs, the company streamlined
the sales force -~ revamping reporting, sys-
tems, offices, and administrative functions.
The effort reduced costs without sacrificing
customer service.


International Tobacco: Growth Business, Growth Industry

  R.J. Reynolds Tobacco International's full-year net sales rose 9 percent and operating company
contribution increased 12 percent compared to 1992.  Volume for the year increased 21 percent
with gains in most markets.  Operating profit margin increased 3 percent and returns on invest-
ment also rose substantially.
  R.J. Reynolds Tobacco International markets three of the top-10 international brands: Camel,
Winston and Salem.  Three factors drove performance in 1993: solid performance by the com-
pany's international brands; incremental growth in important development markets; and returns
from investments in emerging and newly accessed markets, particularly Eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union.


The principal plans used the following actuarial assumptions for accounting purposes:


ing of Sara Lee's Personal Products
business announced in June 1994, sheer
hosiery capacity in all major markets is
being adjusted to match market demand.
Concurrently, capacity for more casual
products, such as tights, opaques and
trouser socks, is being increased.  These
changes will enable Sara Lee to better
capitalize on demand in all legwear
categories, while maintaining leading
market shares.
  Sara Lee will continue to build brand
equity through increased advertising
support and strategic package and dis-
play redesigns.  In addition, an extensive
public awareness campaign designed to
convey messages about the quality,
comfort and functionality of sheer
hosiery products is under way.  In adver-
tising, quality improvements and fea-
tures that enhance appearance are being
emphasized at all price points.
  L'eggs has begun reengineering prod-
uct displays, simplifying the purchase
decision with quicker access to informa-
tion regarding fit, appearance, comfort
and specific product features.
  In Europe, the Dim brand has
undergone an entire packaging and
advertising redesign aimed at reestab-
lishing the dominance of this strong
megabrand and more clearly communi-
cating product attributes.


Major New Products

Product development in both the United
States and Europe is focusing on value-
added products to drive sales in the
sheer hosiery business and capitalize
on emerging trends in casual legwear.
  In the United States, 15 products
were either launched during the latter
half of fiscal 1994 or will be introduced
in early fiscal 1995.
  Hanes introductions included two
products offering waist-to-toe figure
control: Smooth Illusions hosiery, which
combines body contouring with a sheer
appearance, and the more moderately
priced Profiles brand.  Other successful
introductions were Silk Reflections Soft
Touch microfiber hosiery and the Silk
Reflections Plus product for full-figured
women.  During fiscal 1995, Hanes will
feature a new line of casual legwear for
younger women through its E.G. Smith
designer label.
  In fiscal 1994, L'eggs New Sheer
Energy hosiery, with enhanced comfort
and fit, was introduced nationally.
L'eggs also introduced sheer and casual
legwear under the Hanes Her Way
brand, Color Me Natural hosiery for
African-American women, and a new
toning and shaping product, Sheer
Energy Shapers.
  Control-top, microfiber and ultra-


sheer features are the focus of new or
improved hosiery in Europe as well.
The Filodoro Group, a leading Italian
hosiery manufacturer acquired in fiscal
1993, will expand product offerings
in the children's category and begin
distribution of its Philippe Matignon
brand in France.

Global Opportunities

Long-term profitability for Sara Lee's
hosiery business will be fueled by pro-
gressive new product development, as
well as initiatives and acquisitions that
open new markets.
  Fiscal 1994 acquisitions included The
South African Hosiery Company (Pty.)
Ltd., which markets products under
several brand names in South Africa,
and Peri Shoji Co., Ltd., which further
established Sara Lee hosiery in Japan.
Sara Lee acquired a majority ownership
position in Shanghai Vocal Enterprise
Ltd., a Chinese hosiery company, early
in fiscal 1995.
  Geographic expansion continued in
the Americas, with the Hanes and L'eggs
brands going into full distribution in
Canada during fiscal 1994.  In addition,
the L'eggs brand and designer collection
of Donna Karan hosiery were introduced
in Mexico and Japan.


This Financial Review discusses the
corporation's results of operations and
financial position.  The discussion should
be read in conjunction with the Review
of Operations and the Consolidated
Financial Statements and related notes.

Results of Operations

Net sales increased 6.6% to $15.5 billion
in 1994, from $14.6 billion in 1993 and
$13.2 billion in 1992.  The increase in
1994 was principally attributable to
business acquisitions and unit volume
growth, offset in part by the weakening
of foreign currencies relative to the U.S.
dollar.  The increase in 1993 resulted
principally from business acquisitions,
net of dispositions, unit volume growth
and the strengthening of foreign cur-
rencies relative to the U.S. dollar.  Exclud-
ing the effects of foreign currencies and
acquisitions and dispositions, sales dollars
increased 3% in 1994 and 5% in 1993.
  The gross profit margin was 37.6%
in 1994, compared with 38.0% in 1993
and 37.3% in 1992.  The decrease in
1994 was attributable to margin declines
in European hosiery and knit products
businesses, offset in part by improved
margins in the Household and Personal
Care and Packaged Meats and Bakery
operations.  The improvement in 1993
was attributable to increased operating
efficiencies resulting from business
restructuring, tighter cost controls
and benefits resulting from capital
expenditures.
  Operating income, which is pretax
earnings before interest and corporate
expenses, decreased 51.6% to $632
million, from $1,307 million in 1993,
while the 1993 operating income
reflected an 8.2% increase over the
$1,207 million in 1992.
  On June 6, 1994, the corporation
announced a restructuring of its world-
wide operations which will result in the
closure of 94 manufacturing and distri-
bution facilities and the severance of
9,900 employees.  This restructuring


reduced 1994 operating income, net
income and primary earnings per share
by $732 million, $495 million and
$1.03, respectively.  The 1994 operating
income includes charges for restructur-
ing as follows:  Personal Products-~
$630 million; Household and Personal
Care-~$55 million; Coffee and
Grocery-~$25 million; and Packaged
Meats and Bakery-~$22 million.
  Of the total pretax charge for
restructuring, $289 million relates to
anticipated losses associated with the
disposal of land, buildings and improve-
ments, and machinery and equipment;
$112 million relates to anticipated expen-
ditures to close and dispose of the idle
facilities; $239 million relates to antici-
pated payments to severed employees;
$33 million relates to the recognition
of pension benefits associated with the
severed employee group; and $59 mil-
lion primarily relates to losses associated
with the disposal of certain businesses.
As of July 2, 1994, no material actions
contemplated in the restructuring plan
have taken place.
  Restructuring actions are expected
to be substantially completed by 1996,
and the corporation expects to fund the
costs of the plan from internal sources
and available borrowing capacity.
  The corporation expects the restruc-
turing plan to begin lowering operating
costs in 1995 and to generate increasing
savings in subsequent years, growing
to an annual savings of approximately
$250 million in 1998.  Savings from
the planned actions will be used for
both business-building initiatives and
profit improvement.
  Excluding the effects of the restruc-
turing charge, acquisitions and fluctua-
tions in foreign exchange rates, operating
income in 1994 was virtually unchanged
from 1993 and increased by approxi-
mately 2% in 1993. In 1994, operating
income in the Packaged Foods segment
increased 2.3% and Packaged Consumer
Products segment decreased 94.5%.


  Excluding the restructuring charge,
operating income in the Packaged Foods
segment increased 10.5% while the
Packaged Consumer Products segment
was virtually unchanged from 1993
results.  The increase in the Packaged
Foods segment is primarily attributable
to higher unit volumes, operating effi-
ciencies, cost controls and business
acquisitions, offset in part by the weak-
ening of foreign currencies relative to
the U.S. dollar. The flat results in the
Packaged Consumer Products segment
were primarily attributable to weak
performances in the European hosiery
and knit products operations and the
weakening of foreign currencies relative
to the U.S. dollar, offset by the impact
of business acquisitions and strong
U.S. knit products and worldwide
intimates results.
  Net interest expense was $145 million
in 1994, compared with $82 million in
1993 and $94 million in 1992. The
increase in 1994 was a result of increased
financing needs for acquisitions and
capital expenditures.  The reduction in
1993 was primarily a result of lower
short-term interest rates and the tempo-
rary refinancing of maturing long-term
debt with short-term notes payable.
  Unallocated corporate expenses are
costs not directly attributable to specific
segment operations.  Unallocated cor-
porate expenses were $98 million in
1994 and $143 million in 1993.  The
reduction in 1994 was primarily attribut-
able to lower administrative expenses
and costs related to hedging foreign
currency movements.  Unallocated cor-
porate expenses, excluding the impact
of unusual items, were $161 million in
1992.  The unusual items recognized in
1992 consisted of a $412 million gain
from the sale of the corporation's over-
the-counter pharmaceutical business,
offset in part by a $190 million provision
primarily related to restructuring
the Packaged Foods segment.  The
restructuring consisted primarily of

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON FINANCIAL INFORMATION


Management of Sara Lee Corporation is
responsible for the preparation and
integrity of the financial information
included in this annual report.  The
financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and, where
required, reflect our best estimates
and judgments.
  It is the corporation's policy to main-
tain a control-conscious environment
through an effective system of internal
accounting controls supported by formal
policies and procedures communicated
throughout the corporation.  These con-
trols are adequate to provide reasonable
assurance that assets are safeguarded
against loss or unauthorized use and to
produce the records necessary for the
preparation of financial information.
There are limits inherent in all systems
of internal control based on the recogni-
tion that the costs of such systems
should be related to the benefits to be
derived.  We believe the corporation's
systems provide this appropriate balance.
  The control environment is comple-


mented by the corporation's internal 
auditors, who perform extensive audits
and evaluate the adequacy of and the
adherence to these controls, policies
and procedures.  In addition, the corpo-
ration's independent public accountants
have developed an understanding of our
accounting and financial controls, and
have conducted such tests as they
consider necessary to support their
report below.
  The board of directors pursues its
oversight role for the financial state-
ments through the Audit Committee,
which is composed solely of outside
directors.  The Audit Committee
meets regularly with management, the
corporate internal auditors and Arthur
Andersen LLP, jointly and separately,
to receive reports on management's
process of implementation and adminis-
tration of internal accounting controls,
as well as auditing and financial
reporting matters.  Both Arthur
Andersen LLP and the internal
auditors have unrestricted access to
the Audit Committee.


  The corporation maintains high
standards in selecting, training and
developing personnel to help ensure
that management's objectives of
maintaining strong, effective internal
controls and unbiased, uniform reporting
standards are attained.  We believe it is
essential for the corporation to conduct
its business affairs in accordance with
the highest ethical standards as
expressed in Sara Lee Corporation's
Code of Conduct.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


To the Board of Directors
and Stockholders,
Sara Lee Corporation:
  We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of
SARA LEE CORPORATION (a
Maryland corporation) AND SUBSID-
IARIES as of July 2, 1994, July 3, 1993
and June 27, 1992, and the related 
consolidated statements of income,
common stockholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the
period ended July 2, 1994.  These
consolidated financial statements are
the responsibility of the Corporation's
management.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.
  We conducted our audits in accord-
ance with generally accepted auditing


standards.  Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the
consolidated financial statements are
free of material misstatement.  An audit
includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the
overall consolidated financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.
  In our opinion, the consolidated finan-
cial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Sara Lee Corporation


and Subsidiaries as of July 2, 1994,
July 3, 1993 and June 27, 1992, and
the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended July 2, 1994 in
conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.
  As explained in the Notes to
Financial Statements, the Corporation
adopted the requirements of Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes," effective July 4, 1993.

  During the year, we began
producing gas from the Antrim, a
shale formation across much of
northern Michigan.  By employing
best practices of other producers
in the area, we were able to devel-
op this field more quickly and less
expensively than in the past with-
out compromising our high safety
and environmental standards.  We
are exploring for additional gas in
the region.
  "Enhanced" techniques are
used to produce oil that is difficult
to extract from reservoirs by pri-
mary means.  We inject steam, pri-
marily in California, to dislodge
heavy crudes.  Carbon dioxide is
injected, primarily in West Texas,
to improve the recovery of lighter
crudes.  Enhanced operations
accounted for 35 percent of net
domestic crude oil and condensate
production in 1993.
  Natural Gas - We continue to
seek opportunities to produce


and market natural gas, and are
continuing our strategy of selling
our gas to longer-term customers
who place a high value on a reli-
able and secure supply.  In sup-
port of this strategy, we obtained
storage capacity and became a
more aggressive purchaser of
third-party gas for resale.

International Operations

  In 1993, we explored and/or
produced in 12 countries outside
the United States.  International
operations accounted for about
10 percent of our net production
on a crude oil equivalent basis.
  International production of
crude oil and condensate was
61,000 barrels per day, essentially
unchanged from 1992.  Principal
production was in Syria and
Cameroon, with Syria contribut-
ing over 50 percent of our net
international crude oil and con-

densate production.  Late in
1993, we combined our Syrian
exploration and production


operations with selected explo-
ration and production holdings
of a subsidiary of Shell Petroleum
N.V. We own a 25 percent equi-
ty interest in the new company.
  A major portion of future
crude oil production outside the
United States will come from
Yemen and China.  In the Yemen-
Masila Block, where we have a 20
percent ownership interest, pro-
duction began in July 1993 at a
gross rate of 50,000 barrels per
day following completion of field
production facilities and a
pipeline and offshore loading ter-
minal.  By the end of 1993, pro-
duction had reached more than
125,000 barrels of oil per day as
additional wells were brought on
stream.  Offshore China, Shell Oil
and other working interest owners
began fabrication of platforms to
develop two oil fields in the Pearl
River Mouth Basin.  Production
from one field should begin by
late 1994, with production from
the other commencing in 1995.
  Net natural gas production
increased 39 percent to 39 mil-
lion cubic feet per day, due pri-
marily to initial production from
a platform in the Merluza Field,
offshore Brazil.  Principal produc-
tion was in New Zealand and
Syria, as well as Brazil.
  During 1993, with others, we
conducted seismic operations in
Syria, Yemen, Angola, China and
Cameroon, and drilled exploration
wells in Syria, Yemen, Angola and
Indonesia.  At year-end, explo-
ration drilling had commenced in
Bolivia.  In the coming year, we
expect to continue our exploration
efforts in these countries and to
add selected new ventures.

and Malaysian operations, were transferred to affiliates of the
Royal Dutch/Shell Group of Companies.

Liquidity - Internally generated cash, access to outside
financing based on strong credit ratings, and prudent man-
agement of working capital are the essential components of
Shell Oil's liquidity position.  Cash and cash equivalents
amounted to $1,296 million at year-end 1993, an increase of
$562 million over 1992 and $744 million over 1991.
  Shell Oil's strategy continues to rely mainly on internally
generated cash to finance routine operating requirements
and capital spending.  Short-term borrowings will generally
be used to fund interim working capital needs and unusual
requirements.  As of December 31, 1993, unused backup
credit facilities of $500 million were available for general
corporate purposes, including support of commercial notes.
The Company plans to manage the level of backup facilities
consistent with its cash and cash equivalents balances.  Dur-
ing 1993, Shell Oil redeemed all of the existing $250 million
of 8 3/8 percent Notes Due 1996 and retired $250 million
of 7 5/8 percent Notes Due 1993.  As of the end of 1993,
$500 million of a $1.0 billion  shelf registration remained,
allowing future flexibility in the markets.
  The Company utilizes financial derivatives from time to
time to manage its financial risk exposure to interest rates and
certain commodity prices.  During 1993 Shell Oil entered
into interest rate swaps related to existing long term debt.  At
December 31, 1993, the notional amount of such swaps was
$250 million with maturities extending into 1996.  In the
future, the Company may increase the level of financial deriv-
atives activities as business conditions warrant.
  Working capital at the end of 1993 increased $185 mil-
lion over a year earlier due primarily to higher cash and cash
equivalents, offset in part by lower receivables and invento-
ries.  Shell Oil's liquidity position is considerably stronger
than indicated by these working capital levels because of rel-
atively lower historical costs assigned to inventories under
LIFO accounting procedures.  The year-end inventory values


included in working capital were below their current costs by
$648 million at the end of 1993, $1,049 million in 1992
and $1,104 million in 1991.  Current assets exceeded cur-
rent liabilities by $273 million at the end of 1993, $88 mil-
lion at the end of 1992, while current liabilities exceeded
current assets by $1,262 million at the end of 1991.

Environmental Matters

  Shell Oil continues to make substantial capital and oper-
ating expenditures relating to the environment, including
expenditures associated with compliance with federal, state
and local environmental regulations.  Included within such
expenditures are costs of compliance with the various laws,
regulations and permit requirements concerning reduction
of releases into air and water and disposal and handling of
wastes at ongoing operating locations.  Also included within
such overall environmental expenditures are the costs of
remedial orders, corrective action requirements and other
cleanup obligations under federal, state and local law and by
contract both at operating locations and at previously owned
or operated properties, as well as remediation costs at off-
premises sites.
  Discussions are ongoing with governmental agencies as to
the scope and magnitude of Shell Oil's present closure and
post-closure Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA) and similar state or local remediation obligations at
operating locations.  Such discussions are part of the normal
RCRA regulatory process.  Shell Oil anticipates that those
discussions will result in corrective action being required cur-
rently at its manufacturing locations.  The complexity of the
fact issues and the evolving legal requirements, coupled with
the many choices made available by diverse technologies that
may be used in such corrective action, make it difficult to
estimate with great reliability the total costs of such action.
However, Shell Oil currently estimates the costs of imple-
menting corrective action at its Martinez, California  Manu-
facturing Complex to be about $20 million, of which
approximately $16 million has been expended and the
remainder has been provided for in the accounts.  This esti-
mate is down approximately $10 million from previous esti-
mates because investigations to date have uncovered less con-
tamination than expected and more cost-effective remedia-
tion methods have been utilized.  Expenditures at Martinez
have taken place over five years with the maximum expendi-
ture in any year being about $7 million.  Corrective action at
Shell Oil's Carson Plant (part of the former Wilmington
Refinery) is expected to cost about $13 million, which
amount is also provided for in the accounts.  We are not

18. Operating Segments Information (continued)

  Among the issues confirmed by the Stipulation and Agreement is the ability of Tennessee to collect from customers,
on an accrual basis, the costs of providing benefits other than pensions to retirees.  These costs were previously collected
from customers on a "pay-as-you-go" basis.  The Stipulation and Agreement allowed Tennessee to collect over a 20-year
period the transition obligation related to postretirement benefit costs.  Tennessee had previously expensed these amounts
when FAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," was adopted in 1992.
As a result of this Stipulation and Agreement, Tennessee has established a regulatory asset of $34 million and has
included the income effect of this favorable regulatory development in the income statement caption, "Other income, net."
  On June 25, 1992, the FERC approved a settlement allowing Tennessee to recover from its customers up to
$650 million of excess gas supply costs incurred through July 1, 1992, in resolving take-or-pay costs and payments to
producers to suspend or terminate contracts or to reduce contract prices to market levels.  The settlement also allowed
Tennessee to place into effect, as of July 1, 1992, a Gas Inventory Charge providing a mechanism for the recovery of
these excess gas supply costs until September 1, 1993, the effective date of Tennessee's implementation of Order No. 636.
Tennessee charged to operating expenses that portion of excess gas supply costs incurred prior to the implementation of
Order No. 636 that it cannot recover from customers.
  On April 8, 1992, the FERC issued Order No. 636 which, together with subsequently issued clarifying Order
Nos. 636-A and 636-B (the "FERC Restructuring Orders"), directed a further sweeping restructuring of the interstate
gas pipeline industry.  The FERC Restructuring Orders required pipelines to: 1) "unbundle" their transportation and
storage services from their sales services, 2) increase pipeline customers' flexibility to change receipt and delivery points
under transportation contracts and to allow release of capacity under those contracts for use by others and 3) separate
interstate pipeline gas sales organizations from interstate pipeline transportation and storage business units.  Under the
FERC Restructuring Orders, rates for pipeline transportation and storage generally remain subject to traditional cost-
of-service regulation but under a rate design which is relatively insensitive to throughput and hence less sensitive to
seasonal variation.  Sales of natural gas by interstate pipelines occur pursuant to a blanket sales certificate under which
price and other terms of sale are set by market forces.  After a series of FERC orders and compliance filings, Tennessee
implemented its Order No. 636 tariff commencing on September 1, 1993, restructuring its transportation, storage
and sales services.
  The FERC Restructuring Orders recognized that transition costs, including gas supply realignment costs, may result
from this restructuring and provided mechanisms for the full recovery of such qualified costs.  Pipelines were encouraged
to propose various mechanisms in the restructuring proceedings to reduce transition costs, including assignment of gas
supply contracts and phasing in of the conversions of the pipeline sales service.  The FERC Restructuring Orders specified
that pipelines would be allowed to make special filings to recover many types of transition costs.
  Tennessee has made multiple filings to begin recovery of certain transition costs already paid or obligated to be
paid in connection with the FERC Restructuring Orders.  Tennessee's filings request authority to: 1) recover, through a
monthly surcharge, one-time gas supply realignment costs and certain related costs incurred to date over a twelve-month
period, 2) direct-bill customers for unrecovered gas costs over a twelve-month period and 3) track and recover, through
an annual surcharge, upstream transportation costs from customers.  The filings were accepted effective September 1,
1993, and made subject to refund pending review.  Hearings have been instituted to review the recovery of the gas supply
realignment costs and the direct billing of unrecovered gas costs.  Tennessee's filings to recover production costs related
to its Bastian Bay facilities have been rejected by the FERC based on the continued use of the gas production from the
field, however, the FERC recognized the ability of Tennessee to file for the recovery of losses upon disposition of these
assets.  Tennessee will seek appellate review of the FERC actions.  Tennessee is confident that the Bastian Bay costs will
ultimately be recovered as transition costs directly related to Order No. 636, and no FERC order has questioned the
ultimate recoverability of these costs.
  The total amount of transition costs that will be incurred by Tennessee will depend upon: 1) developments in
restructuring proceedings involving Tennessee, its customers and other affected parties, 2) the resolution of pending
litigation and 3) the terms of multiple negotiations with individual suppliers.  Until these issues are resolved, Tennessee
cannot finally determine the ultimate amount of one-time realignment costs or other related annual costs it will incur,
nor the amounts which will be recovered from customers.  Tennessee believes that one-time realignment costs will not
exceed $700 million.  At December 31, 1993, Tennessee recorded and deferred approximately $120 million of such one-
time costs which are recoverable from its customers. Tennessee believes that other related annual costs will not exceed
$100 million in 1994, decreasing thereafter over the length of the contracts involved.
  The FERC Restructuring Orders will undergo judicial review, clarifications and formulation of cost recovery details
as the restructuring process proceeds.  However, Tennessee believes that it is entitled to full recovery of all transition costs
it will incur.  Given the fact that the FERC Restructuring Orders contemplate complete recovery by pipelines of qualified
transition costs, Tenneco believes that Tennessee's Order No. 636 restructuring (together with the Order No. 636
restructuring of Tenneco's other interstate pipelines) will not have a material effect on Tenneco's consolidated financial
position or results of operations.


The preceding notes are an integral part of the foregoing financial statements.


Management's Report


The accompanying consolidated financial statements of USX Corporation and Subsidiary Companies
(USX) are the responsibility of and have been prepared by USX in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.  They necessarily include some amounts that are based on best judgments and
estimates.  The consolidated financial information displayed in other sections of this report is con-
sistent with that in these consolidated financial statements.
  USX seeks to assure the objectivity and integrity of its financial records by careful selection of its
managers, by organizational arrangements that provide an appropriate division of responsibility and
by communications programs aimed at assuring that its policies and methods are understood
throughout the organization.
  USX has a comprehensive formalized system of internal accounting controls designed to provide
reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that financial records are reliable.  Appropriate
management monitors the system for compliance, and the internal auditors independently measure its
effectiveness and recommend possible improvements thereto.  In addition, as part of their audit of the
consolidated financial statements, USX's independent accountants, who are elected by the stockholders,
review and test the internal accounting controls selectively to establish a basis of reliance thereon in
determining the nature, extent and timing of audit tests to be applied.
  The Board of Directors pursues its oversight role in the area of financial reporting and internal
accounting control through its Audit Committee.  This Committee, composed solely of nonmanagement
directors, regularly meets (jointly and separately) with the independent accountants, management and
internal auditors to monitor the proper discharge by each of its responsibilities relative to internal
accounting controls and the consolidated financial statements.


Report of Independent Accountants


In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing on pages 34 through 56
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of USX Corporation and Subsidiary Companies
at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
These financial statements are the responsibility of USX's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for the opinion expressed above.
  As discussed in Note 1, page 40, in 1993 USX adopted new accounting standards for
postemployment benefits and for retrospectively rated insurance contracts.  As discussed in Note 8,
page 45, and Note 9, page 46, in 1992 USX adopted new accounting standards for postretirement
benefits other than pensions and for income taxes, respectively.


Five-Year Financial Summary

TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS


The Westinghouse Electric Corporation has experienced
a tumultuous four years.  In that time we have had four
chairmen.  We have liquidated one major business and
divested two others (representing about 23 percent of our
1993 revenue), and incurred writeoffs of over $5 billion.
We have seen our core earnings decline by nearly 20 percent,
and reduced employment by 15 percent.  Consequently,
there is a high degree of uncertainty among shareholders,
customers, employees, suppliers and financial institutions.
  I came to Westinghouse as an outsider.  Frankly, after all
I had read about the company, I expected to find a hopeless
mess.  But after rigorously analyzing every Westinghouse
business, issue and opportunity, I was very pleasantly


Second, we are simply going to run these businesses
better and more intensely than at any time in the past.
I'm not saying we've run them badly; in fact, we've been
largely successful.  But going forward, all of our people will
be searching intensely for improvement opportunities in
cost, product features and competitive position.  To meet
our goals, these good businesses have to become out-
standing ones, with leadership in financial performance.  All
Westinghouse employees-~85,000 people-~are committed
to that end.
  Finally, we are going to run the total corporation in
a hands-on, informal fashion, blending initiative and
corporate perspective with speed of response and decision-
making.  We're going to have a significantly smaller corpo-
rate center that's actively involved in supporting our
businesses.  We're going to identify problems early, resolve
them fast, and marshal our people and investment resources


Changes in Accounting Principles
In December 1993, the Corporation adopted, retroactive to
January 1, 1993, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 112 "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits." This statement requires employers to adopt accrual
accounting for workers' compensation, salary continuation,
medical and life insurance continuation, severance benefits and
disability benefits provided to former or inactive employees
after employment but before retirement.  See note 4 to the
financial statements.
  Effective January 1, 1992, the Corporation adopted SFAS
No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions," on the immediate recognition basis.
This statement requires that the expected costs of providing
postretirement health care and life insurance benefits be
accrued during the employees' service with the Corporation.
The Corporation's previous practice was to expense these costs
as incurred.  See note 4 to the financial statements.
  In the first quarter of 1992, the Corporation adopted the
provisions of SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."
This statement replaced SFAS No. 96, which the Corporation
previously used to account for income taxes.  SFAS No. 109
permitted the Corporation to recognize certain deferred tax
benefits not recognized under SFAS No. 96.  See note 5 to the
financial statements.
  In December 1992, the Corporation adopted SFAS No. 107,
"Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments."  This
statement is an extension of SFAS No. 105, "Disclosure of
Information about Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-
Sheet Risk and Financial Instruments with Concentrations of
Credit Risk," adopted in a prior year, and requires the disclosure
of the fair value of certain financial instruments.  See note 22 to
the financial statements.

NOTE 2:  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In November 1992, the Corporation announced the Plan that
included exiting the financial services business through the
disposition of its asset portfolios and the sale of other non-
strategic businesses.  The Plan provided for the sale of real estate
and corporate finance portfolios over a three-year period and
the run-off of the leasing portfolio over a longer period of time
in accordance with contractual terms.  Also, as part of the Plan,
the Corporation was to divest the following other non-strategic
operations:  DCBU and WESCO; Knoll; and WCI.  Financial
Services and Other Operations have been accounted for as
discontinued operations in accordance with APB 30.
  In January 1994, the Corporation announced that the
planned sale of WCI will be accelerated from 1995 into 1994
and Knoll is no longer for sale.  With respect to Knoll, the Cor-
poration's strategy will now be directed to create shareholder
value by continuing to operate this business.


  As a result of the adoption of the Plan, the Corporation
recorded in Discontinued Operations, during the fourth quarter
of 1992, a pre-tax charge of $2,201 million.  This pre-tax charge
consisted of $2,350 million for an addition to the valuation
allowance for Financial Services portfolios, $300 million for esti-
mated losses from operations for Financial Services during the
phase-out period and $144 million for restructuring charges
related to the change in corporate strategy.  These charges were
partially offset by an estimated $449 million gain from the dis-
position of Other Operations and an estimated $144 million of
earnings from those operations during the phase-out period.
Income tax benefits totalling $818 million were recorded in
connection with the Plan.  The after-tax estimated loss on the
disposal of Discontinued Operations was $1,383 million.  A
$36 million charge for corporate restructuring was recorded in
Continuing Operations in connection with the Plan.
  In November 1992, in determining the valuation provision
for Financial Services real estate portfolio, management used
the Derived Investment Value (DIV) method.  DIV is the
process developed by the Resolution Trust Corporation for use
in measuring the values of real estate owned and loans secured
by income-producing assets and land.  In developing the provi-
sion for Financial Services corporate and leasing portfolios,
management used various techniques which considered a num-
ber of factors, including trading desk values with respect to the
corporate portfolio, and information provided by independent
consultants.  Trading desk values arise from actual or proposed
current trades of identical or similar assets.  These valuation
processes provided portfolio valuations that reflect the strategy
of exiting the financial services business.  Under the Corpora-
tion's previous strategy of downsizing Financial Services over a
period of up to five years and holding certain assets for the long
term, the methods used to value assets resulted in higher asset
values net of valuation allowances.
  The estimated gain from the disposition of Other Operations
was determined by management using various techniques and
assumptions which considered, among other factors, index
multiples derived for comparable businesses as appropriately
adjusted to reflect the characteristics of the businesses within
Other Operations.
  Variances from estimates which may occur will be considered
in determining if an adjustment of the estimated loss on disposal
of Discontinued Operations is necessary.
  Since adoption of the Plan, the Corporation has made
significant progress in disposing of Financial Services assets.
  On August 11, 1993, the Corporation announced an agree-
ment to sell the majority of DCBU to Eaton Corporation for a
purchase price of $1.1 billion and the assumption by the buyer
of certain liabilities.  The Corporation completed this sale on
January 31, 1994.
  On February 16, 1994, the Corporation announced an agree-
ment to sell WESCO to an affiliate of Clayton, Dubilier &
Rice, Inc., a private investment firm, for a purchase price of
approximately $340 million.  The Corporation completed this
sale on February 28, 1994.


  The reserve for the estimated loss on the disposal of
Discontinued Operations established in November 1992 con-
sisted of an addition to the valuation allowance for Financial
Services portfolios, estimated future results of operations and
sales proceeds to be obtained from Discontinued Operations,
as well as estimates as to the timing of the divestitures and
assumptions regarding other relevant factors.
  During 1993, the Corporation reviewed its estimates of
proceeds from the disposal of Discontinued Operations and the
operating income or loss that would be generated by these busi-
nesses during their disposal periods.  Through the third quarter
of 1993, the Corporation had favorable experience with the sale
of Financial Services assets, selling them at prices in excess of
original estimates and on a more accelerated schedule than was
anticipated at the time the Plan was developed.  The more rapid
liquidation of the assets had the effect of reducing the earned
income from the Financial Services assets during the disposal
period, which, to a large degree, offset the favorable price expe-
rience from the asset sales.  In addition, the marketing process
for Other Operations indicated that expected proceeds would
be less than the initial forecast.  Through the third quarter of
1993, all of these factors were reviewed and considered to be
largely offsetting.
  In the fourth quarter of 1993, the Corporation recorded
an additional provision for loss on disposal of Discontinued
Operations of $148 million, pre-tax or $95 million, after-tax.
This change in the estimated loss resulted from additional
information, obtained through negotiation activity, regarding
the expected selling prices of WESCO and the Australian sub-
sidiary of DCBU.  Also contributing to this provision was a
decision to bulk sell a Financial Services residential develop-
ment that the Corporation, upon adoption of the Plan, had
intended to transfer to WCI for development.  These matters
and a revision to the estimated interest costs expected to be
incurred by the Discontinued Operations during the disposal
period resulted in the additional fourth quarter provision.
  The reserve for the estimated loss on the disposal of Discon-
tinued Operations may require adjustment in future periods to
reflect changes in any of the above constituent elements, which
may be affected by adverse economic, market or other factors
beyond what was anticipated at December 31, 1993.
  Management has considered all of the above factors and
believes that the reserve for the estimated loss on disposal of
Discontinued Operations should be adequate.  The adequacy of
this reserve is evaluated each quarter, and the actual experience
and any changes in expectations will be considered in determin-
ing whether adjustment to the reserve is required.
  In accordance with APB 30, the consolidated financial state-
ments reflect the operating results of Discontinued Operations
separately from Continuing Operations.  Prior periods have
been restated.  Summarized operating results of Discontinued
Operations follow:

Highlights

The deferred tax (liabilities) assets are comprised of the following:


  Key medical nutritional products also
include Jevity, a tube-feeding product;
Glucerna, for patients with abnormal
glucose tolerance; Nepro for hemodialysis
patients; and Perative and AlitraQ with
glutamine, two products for critically
ill patients.
  To expand the U.S. retail market for
Ensure products, Abbott launched a
national radio, television and print advertis-
ing campaign emphasizing the benefits of
good nutrition and nutrition's cost-effective
role in overall health care, particularly for
older adults.
  In international markets, Ensure, Jevity,
Glucerna and an array of other specialized
products increasingly are being used by
patients recovering from surgery or those
with other medical problems.  Over the
last five years, sales of medical nutritional
products have grown steadily in Europe,
while experiencing strong growth in Japan,
Canada and several countries in Latin
America and Asia.
  Abbott continues to seek growth oppor-
tunities with the introduction of new, more
effective feeding devices to support its
medical nutritional products.  Introduced
in 1993, the Flexiflo Lap G Laparoscopic
Gastrostomy Kit uses laparoscopy, a mini-
mally invasive technique, for gastrostomy
tube placement.  A second procedural kit
using laparoscopic technology for feeding
tube placement is expected to be intro-
duced in 1994.
  The Quantum pump, introduced in
1992, has gained excellent market acceptance
as an innovative, effective device for enteral
feeding.  The automated system has a self-
flushing capability, which decreases the
incidence of tube-clogging.  This feature
improves feeding efficiency and reduces
labor costs.

Pediatric Nutritionals
With its well-established Similac and
Isomil brands, and a broad line of products
for the special nutritional needs of infants
and children, Abbott is the leading infant
formula manufacturer in the U.S. The
company maintained its leadership posi-
tion in 1993 despite highly competitive
market conditions.


  Abbott has responded to changing
market conditions with new products and
marketing approaches.  A line extension
was introduced for Abbott's Isomil brand,
the leading soy formula in the U.S. Isomil
DF (Diarrhea Formulation), a patented
product, was launched as the first infant
formula clinically shown to shorten the
duration of loose, watery stools during
diarrhea in infants.
  For the special nutritional needs of
children ages 1 to 10, Abbott introduced
PediaSure With Fiber.  The product helps
normalize bowel function.  Both PediaSure
and PediaSure With Fiber provide complete
liquid nutrition for children with chronic
conditions that prevent normal eating or
require long-term tube feeding.  The
products also may be used for children
recovering from trauma or illness, in
preparation for or recovery from surgery,
or as an everyday nutritional supplement
with or between meals.
  A new system of 17 highly specialized
nutritionals designed for the nutritional
management of infants, children and adults
with metabolic disorders was launched in
1993.  The Ross Metabolic Formula System
provides nutritional products necessary
from birth through adulthood for patients
who must observe lifetime dietary restric-
tions to avoid serious developmental
problems.  These products are sold on the
recommendation of physicians.
  Also introduced was Pedialyte Bubble
Gum Flavor, a pleasant-tasting oral elec-
trolyte solution for maintenance of fluids
and minerals lost in diarrhea, a potentially
dangerous condition for infants and children.
  Pedialyte Bubble Gum Flavor helps
to improve compliance, especially among
toddlers and older children for whom
flavor may be an issue.  The Pedialyte line of
products is being promoted nationwide in
television and print advertisements.
  In international markets, the company
continues to expand its infant nutritional
business with new products and further
penetration of emerging markets in
Latin America and the Pacific Rim.  Gain,
Abbott's follow-on formula for older babies,
is achieving excellent growth in several
international markets, including Taiwan,
the Philippines and Hong Kong.


Supporting Education
For over 25 years, Abbott has supported a variety of
education programs, with a special emphasis on attracting
students to the technical and scientific fields that serve as
the backbone of Abbott Laboratories.
  "Girls and Science: Linkages for the Future" encourages
young women to enter science and engineering.  In conjunc-
tion with the American Association for the Advancement
of Science (AAAS) and with volunteer support from
Abbott employees, the company sponsored training work-
shops for Girl Scout councils in Illinois and Wisconsin at
the corporate headquarters.  AAAS instructors taught troop
leaders how to conduct hands-on science and math experi-
ments.  The program will potentially reach more than
20,000 Girl Scouts.  More than 30 Abbott scientists and
engineers volunteered to act as role models for the troops.
  In Barceloneta, Puerto Rico, Abbott is underwriting a
similar AAAS program focusing on science and math skills
for Hispanic students.  Fifty elementary school teachers
learned a variety of scientific experiments appropriate for
their classrooms and will share their training with other
teachers.  Abbott also donated materials and is providing
technical support from Abbott employee volunteers.
  "Advancing Minorities' Interest in Engineering (AMIE):
A Coalition of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and
Fortune Companies," a newly created alliance, is the outcome
of an Abbott-sponsored initiative.  Together, member cor-
porations and the nine historically black schools in the
U.S. are working to increase the opportunities available for
minorities to pursue and succeed in engineering careers.
  "CHOICES" is a program presented to ninth-graders by
trained Abbott employee volunteers who visit students in
their classrooms.  Through exercises and discussions, these
volunteers help children understand that staying in school
gives them more choices in life.  CHOICES is an excellent
example of how the educational and business communities
can work together to prepare students for adult life.

Caring for the Environment
Abbott's corporate philosophy is that business leaders also
must be environmental leaders, and that the company's
actions today will have an impact on future generations.
The company focuses on the three "Rs" of environmental


protection: reduce, reuse and recycle.  Abbott continually
assesses thousands of manufacturing processes, products
and packages to determine how they can be made more
environmentally friendly.
  Reducing the volume of material put into a product helps
to lower manufacturing and disposal costs.  For example,
decreasing the width of a plastic wall by only a fraction of
an inch in a disposable cartridge used in an Abbott Vision
blood analyzer takes on new significance when that piece is
reproduced several hundred thousand times each year.
  One of the best alternatives to disposing of waste
is selling it to another company that can use it in a
manufacturing process.  For example, some Abbott manu-
facturing byproducts are used to clean printing presses and
in windshield washer solvent.
  In the U.S., Abbott recycles approximately 30 million
pounds of material each year.  Approximately one-third of
this amount is paper and cardboard boxes.  The remainder
includes plastic, glass, aluminum and steel.

Abbott Donations
Abbott donations include both products given to worldwide
relief efforts and cash contributions made to educational,
health, human service, civic and cultural organizations.
Employee gifts to hospitals, schools and public broadcasting
stations are matched dollar-for-dollar by the company.
  Generous employee and corporate gifts to United Way
fund-raising campaigns at Abbott facilities totaled
$4.5 million in 1993.
  In 1993, The Clara Abbott Foundation, which is incor-
porated as an independent entity, awarded more than
$5 million in educational grants to the children of Abbott
employees and retirees in 1993.  The foundation also pro-
vided Abbott employees and retirees with funds to meet
unexpected financial difficulties such as medical expenses
and loans to replace homes damaged by natural disasters.

Equal Employment Opportunity
It is the policy of Abbott Laboratories to provide equal
opportunity in all areas of its employment practices without
regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age,
ancestry, citizenship, disability, veteran status, marital status,
sexual orientation or any other reason prohibited by law.


Of the investment securities listed above, $293,888,
$409,105, and $424,218, were held at December 31, 1993,
1992, and 1991, respectively, by subsidiaries operating
in Puerto Rico under tax incentive grants expiring from
2002 through 2007.  In addition, these subsidiaries held
cash equivalents of $197,200, $33,800, and $4,000 at
December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.

Note 5 -~ Taxes on Earnings
(dollars in thousands)
Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." This statement
requires that deferred income taxes reflect the tax conse-
quences on future years of differences between the tax bases
of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts.
Prior to 1993, provisions were made for the estimated amount
of income taxes on reported earnings which were payable
currently and in the future.  The effect of this change on
income before taxes and net income was not significant, and
prior years' financial statements have not been restated.
  U.S. income taxes are provided on those earnings of for-
eign subsidiaries and subsidiaries operating in Puerto Rico
under tax incentive grants, which are intended to be
remitted to the parent company.  Undistributed earnings
reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries as working
capital and plant and equipment aggregated $702,000 at
December 31, 1993.  Deferred income taxes not provided
on these earnings are not significant.


As of December 31, 1993, total deferred tax assets were
$632,112 and total deferred tax liabilities were $211,839.
Valuation allowances for tax assets are not significant.  The
major temporary differences that give rise to deferred tax
assets are compensation and employee benefits ($146,505),
valuation and exposure reserves for inventory and accounts
receivable ($86,003 and $91,329, respectively), deferred
intercompany profit ($72,129), and state income taxes
($30,715).  The use of accelerated depreciation for U.S.
income tax purposes ($165,482) and employee benefits
($32,578) are the primary temporary differences that give
rise to deferred tax liabilities.


WHISKY PRODUCER WITH ITS ACQUISITION OF INVERGORDON DISTILLERS GROUP PLC.


  Our distilled spirits business
had another strong year, with
operating company contribu-
tion up 13% despite intensified
price competition and a decline
in revenues of 6%.
  Market share improved for
key products in Jim Beam's core
portfolio, although adverse eco-
nomic conditions in many
world markets continued to
depress demand and U.S. con-
sumption continued its long-
term decline.
  The company's flagship
Jim Beam bourbon, #1 in the
world, further strengthened its
leadership position with world-
wide sales of nearly 5 million
cases.  In the U.S., Booker's and
other small batch bourbons
achieved further growth.


  Kessler again increased its
share of the American blended
whiskey market, while
DeKuyper retained its position
as the nation's #1 selling line of
cordials.
  Jim Beam Brands is the sec-
ond largest seller of U.S. bot-
tled Canadian whisky with
Windsor Canadian and Lord
Calvert.  Beam has a 28% share
of this category which contin-
ued to outperform spirits in
general.
  Kamora increased unit vol-
ume, strengthening its position
as the #2 imported coffee
liqueur.  Wolfschmidt vodka
increased volume by over 10%.
  Beam's international sales
increased 10%, with volume
increases in all key markets


including Australia, where
Jim Beam is the largest selling
distilled spirit of any type and
has over half the bourbon
market.
  In November, U.K.-based
Whyte & Mackay completed
the acquisition of Invergordon,
propelling the group to the #3
position in the world scotch
whisky business.  Even exclud-
ing any benefits from the acqui-
sition, Whyte & Mackay
achieved a 28% increase in con-
tribution and its share of the
U.K. scotch whisky market
increased to around 15%.
  Vladivar strengthened its
position as the #2 vodka in the
U.K. with a 12.6% increase in
unit volume.

comparisons will improve as the year progresses and that
full year results for 1994 will approximate 1993's result.
  In addition to the previously discussed increases in U.S.
and U.K. tobacco excise taxes, the Clinton administra-
tion has proposed increasing the tax on cigarettes from 24
cents to 99 cents per pack.  Legislation has also been intro-
duced in the U.S. Congress that would increase excise
taxes on cigarettes.  The effects of any of the foregoing
cannot be determined but will likely add to the overall
industry declines and the shift to lower priced brands.  In
addition, further restrictions on advertising and use of
tobacco products in the U.S., the U.K. and elsewhere are
possible.  A change in timing of the U.K. budget resulted
in a second budget announcement on November 30,
1993, and thereafter will be at about the same time each
year.  This change had the effect of drawing significant
sales into the fourth quarter of 1993 from the first quarter
of 1994.  As a result, the first quarter 1994 comparison
will be especially difficult as 1993's first quarter benefited
from trade buying in anticipation of the March U.K.
budget increase.
  Recent legislation restricts the use of imported tobacco
in U.S. manufactured cigarettes.  Based on the prelimi-
nary rules issued, the impact of this legislation may
increase American Tobacco's 1994 manufacturing cost by
an estimated $10 million.

1992 compared to 1991

  Revenues increased 1% and operating income increased
2%.  Worldwide cigarette unit sales decreased 3.8%.
  International tobacco revenues in sterling increased
slightly as price increases, which principally resulted
from higher U.K. tobacco taxes, line extensions and new
products were largely offset by a 10.9% decline in U.K.
cigarette unit sales.  The U.K. industry declined 6.7%.
Export sales increased principally on shipments of ciga-
rettes to markets in the C.I.S.  The U.K. budgets,
announced in March 1992 and March 1991, each provided
for an increase in taxes on tobacco products with the
result that the tax on a pack of cigarettes increased 13
pence and 22 pence, respectively.  The decline in unit sales
reflected the continuing impact of price increases, includ-
ing the effect of substantial excise tax increases, which,
combined with the prolonged recession, reduced industry
volumes and led to greater price competition and
increased trading down by consumers to lower priced
brands.  These changes particularly affected Gallaher, the
majority of whose sales are in the premium sector.
Despite the decline in unit sales, Gallaher maintained its


position as the #1 tobacco company in the U.K. with an
estimated 41.5% cigarette market share for 1992, com-
pared to 43.5% in 1991.  Operating income in sterling was
up 6% on higher gross margin, favorable comparison to
the 1991 provision for workforce reductions and lower
expenses.  Dollar revenues and operating income percent-
age changes approximated the sterling results.
  Record domestic tobacco revenues increased 3% on
price increases and unit gains in price-value brands,
resulting from product introductions and exports, partly
offset by substantial unit declines in premium brands.
American Tobacco's U.S. unit sales were down 4.3%,
while industry unit sales declined slightly, and market
share for the year was 6.76% compared to 7.03% for
1991.  Price-value brands accounted for 45% of American
Tobacco's U.S. unit sales, compared with 38% in 1991.
Operating income declined 1% on substantially higher
promotional expenses to meet competitive activity and
less favorable product mix, almost offset by price increase
benefits and reductions in coupon redemption accruals.

     DISTILLED SPIRITS

1993 compared to 1992

  Revenues decreased 6% while record operating income
in 1993 rose 10%.
  Beam's revenues were down 5% on lower domestic
volume principally reflecting competitive pricing pres-
sures, the effect of lower foreign exchange rates and a
domestic bulk sale last year.  U.S. distilled spirits con-
sumption continued its long-term decline.  Worldwide
branded case sales were down 1.7% and domestic
branded cases declined 4.6%.  Record operating income
was up slightly on the timing of operating expenses and
higher margins, partly offset by higher international sell-
ing costs.  With recent heavy price competition and con-
sumer rebates, margins may well be under pressure as the
intensifying competitive situation may limit future price
increases.
  Whyte & Mackay revenues in sterling were up 6% on
inclusion of Invergordon for one month and higher vol-
ume, mainly in export markets, partly offset by 1992's
significant level of bulk sales.  Excluding Invergordon,
worldwide case sales were up 10.4% and U.K. case sales
were up 6.5%.  Translated at substantially lower average
foreign exchange rates, revenues were down 9% in dol-
lars.  Operating income in sterling and dollars was up

  During the year, the Company issued $150 million of
7~~~% Debentures, Due 2023.  The net proceeds from this
issuance was used for general corporate purposes, includ-
ing the repayment of outstanding debt.  During 1993,
~75 million of 9~~~% Notes and $20 million in Medium
Term Notes matured.
  At December 31, 1993, the Company had $850 million
of debt securities (including Medium Term Notes) avail-
able for sale under its shelf registration with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
  At year end, the Company had $4 billion of long-term
credit facilities, of which $3.8 billion remained unused.
These facilities are available for general corporate pur-
poses, including acquisitions and support of the Com-
pany's short-term borrowings in the commercial paper
market.  In addition, Gallaher has committed short-term
revolving  credit agreements of ~300 million (approxi-
mately $444 million) which are available for general cor-
porate purposes, including acquisitions.
  The Company believes that its internally generated
funds, together with its access to global credit markets,
are more than adequate to meet its capital needs.
  Working capital decreased from $664.4 million in 1992
to $575.4 million in 1993.  Management believes this is an
adequate level to support continued growth.
  Life insurance net assets were $1.3 billion, up $69.8
million.  Although life insurance net assets and cash flow
are consolidated in the financial statements, generally
Franklin is restricted by the insurance laws of the State of
Illinois as to amounts that can be transferred to the Com-
pany in the form of dividends, loans or advances without
approval of the Director of Insurance.  This restriction has
not had and is not expected to have a material effect on
the ability of the Company to meet its cash obligations.
  Life insurance investments in 1993 increased by $487.6 
million primarily reflecting increases in fixed maturities
and mortgage loans.
  At December 31, 1993, the unrealized gain on
Franklin's held-to-maturity portfolio was $467.1 million.
  In 1993, independent insurance analysts continued to
rate Franklin highly in terms of financial strength.
Franklin has consistently followed a conservative invest-
ment program and has maintained a high-quality port-
folio.  At year-end, only 4.5% of Franklin's held-to-
maturity portfolio was in non-investment grade
securities.  Its mortgage loans represented 9.2% of its
investment portfolio, and its non-performing assets com-
prised less than 1%.


earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested in
these companies.
  Under insurance tax laws in effect for years prior to
1984, a portion of Franklin's accumulated statutory
income has not been subject to tax.  Should the aggre-
gated untaxed income exceed certain prescribed maxi-
mums or cash dividends to the Company exceed the
accumulated taxed portion, the excess would be subject
to federal income tax.  Taxes of $70 million calculated
using the current federal statutory income tax rate have
not been provided on the untaxed income, which aggre-
gated $201 million at December 31, 1993, since Franklin
does not contemplate distributing such income in the
foreseeable future.

Earnings Per Share

  Earnings per Common share are based on the weighted
average number of Common shares outstanding in each
year and after preferred stock dividend requirements.
  Fully diluted earnings per Common share assume that
any convertible debentures and convertible preferred
shares outstanding at the beginning of each year or at
their date of issuance, if later, were converted at those
dates, with related interest, preferred stock dividend
requirements and outstanding Common shares adjusted
accordingly.  It also assumes that outstanding Common
shares were increased by shares issuable upon exercise of
those stock options for which market price exceeds exer-
cise price, less shares which could have been purchased by
the Company with related proceeds.

  ACQUISITIONS

  During the fourth quarter of 1993, Whyte & Mackay
completed its acquisition of Invergordon Distillers
Group PLC ("Invergordon") by purchasing the remain-
ing 58.7% of the outstanding shares of Invergordon for a
cost, including fees and expenses, of $343.6 million.  In
1991, Whyte & Mackay acquired 41.3% of the outstand-
ing shares of Invergordon for a cost, including fees and
expenses, of $255.5 million.  Due to absence of control,
this was recorded in "Other assets" as an investment in
marketable equity securities at a carrying value of $222.2
million at December 31, 1992.  The aggregate cost of
Invergordon of $599.1 million, exceeded the fair value of
net assets acquired by $492.9 million.  The financial state-
ments for prior periods were not restated because the
effect was not material.  Operations, including the effect

  Our excellent, growing core franchises in the United States

these trends by extending our core franchises internationally
and by building a pipeline of prescription products that are can-

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation:  The accompanying consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of American Home
Products Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company).

Cash and Cash Equivalents, for purposes of reporting cash flows,
consists primarily of certificates of deposit, time deposits and
other short-term, highly liquid securities and is stated at cost,
which approximates fair value.

Marketable Securities consists of U.S. government or agency
issues and corporate bonds and are stated at cost, which
approximates fair value.  The fair values are estimated based on
quoted market prices.  In May 1993, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 115 -~ Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities.  This Statement will be adopted
in the first quarter of 1994, and the effect will be immaterial to
the Company.

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.  Inventories
valued under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method amounted to
$148,700,000 at December 31, 1993 and $265,816,000 at
December 31, 1992.  Current value exceeded LIFO value by
$65,607,000 and $52,894,000 at December 31, 1993 and
1992, respectively.  The remaining inventories are valued under
the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or the average cost method.

Inventories at December 31 consisted of:


Goodwill is being amortized on the straight-line method over
periods not exceeding 40 years.  Accumulated amortization was
$636,385,000 and $604,484,000 at December 31, 1993 and
1992, respectively.

Long-Term Debt is stated at face value, which approximates
fair value (see Note 3).  The fair value of the Company's long-
term debt is estimated based on quoted market prices.

2 Acquisitions

On March 19, 1993, the Company acquired M. Polaner, Inc.
(Polaner), a manufacturer of jams, for $67,500,000 in a
purchase transaction.  The excess of the purchase price over the
net assets acquired was approximately $65,600,000.
  In January 1992, the Company acquired a majority interest
in Genetics Institute, Inc. (G.I.), a biopharmaceutical company.
The Company acquired approximately 40% of G.I.'s outstand-
ing common stock for $50 per share in cash and purchased
approximately 9,500,000 newly issued shares of G.I. common
stock for $300,000,000.  The total consideration paid by the
Company for the approximate 60% interest in G.I. was
$666,000,000.  The purchase price exceeded the net tangible
assets acquired by approximately $365,000,000 of which
$220,000,000 was attributable to acquired research and was
expensed as a special charge in 1992.  The unamortized goodwill
at December 31, 1993 was $164,000,000 inclusive of addi-
tional share purchases of 40,000 and 907,000 shares in 1993
and 1992, respectively, bringing the Company's total ownership
at December 31, 1993 to approximately 64%.  The Company
holds an option to acquire the remaining shares of G.I. from
the public shareholders over a five-year period ending Decem-
ber 31, 1996 at prices escalating by approximately $1.84 per
quarter, to $85 per share through December 31, 1996.  At
January 1, 1994, the option price per share was $64.74.  The
Company has the right to acquire additional shares through
open market or privately negotiated purchases, provided that its
aggregate holdings do not exceed 75% of G.I.'s outstanding
equity.  G.I. continues as a publicly traded company.
  On September 24, 1992, pursuant to a Stock Purchase
Agreement, the Company acquired Symbiosis Corp.
(Symbiosis), a manufacturer of disposable surgical instruments.
Under the terms of the agreement, the Company paid

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


(1) These segments include the special charge of $220,000,000
in 1992 (see Note 2).
(2) Capital expenditures for 1992 include additions from busi-
nesses acquired.
   Transactions between industry and geographic segments
are not material.  Foreign exchange adjustments, which were
included in operating income before taxes in this note and
in other expense (income), net in the Consolidated Statements
of Income on page 29, resulted in net charges to income of
$55,475,000 in 1993, $23,662,000 in 1992 and $66,610,000
in 1991, principally in the Canada and Latin America segment
(see Note 8).

Selected Quarterly Financial Information (Unaudited)


The Company's financial position with respect to cash, cash
equivalents, and short-term investments, net of short-term
borrowings, increased to $966 million at September 30, 1994,
from $69 million at September 24, 1993.  This increase reflects a
$300 million issuance of ten-year unsecured notes, the proceeds
of which replaced a portion of the Company's short-term financ-
ing.  The improvement in the Company's financial condition was
also attributable to the Company's continued efforts to increase
profit levels and to manage working capital, particularly in the
area of inventory management.
  More cash was generated by operations in 1994 compared
with 1993, primarily because of a significant decrease in inventory


levels, as well as increased sales levels.  The significant decrease in
inventory levels during 1994 resulted from improved inventory
management, higher 1994 sales levels attributable to various
pricing and promotional actions, and strong sales of new product
inventory that had been built up in preparation for the intro-
duction of Power Macintosh.  Profit levels improved as operating
expenses decreased due to the Company's implementation of
restructuring actions initiated in the third quarter of 1993.
  Cash generated by operations in 1994 was partially offset
by cash used for restructuring and an increase in accounts
receivable.  The increase in accounts receivable reflected an
increase in sales levels achieved during 1994.  The balance of

Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows


Restricted Stock Plan

On April 1, 1993, the Company's Board of Directors approved
a Restricted Stock Plan for officers of the Company (the RSP),
which became effective July 1, 1993.  The RSP was subsequently
ratified by the shareholders on January 26, 1994.  The RSP is
designed to provide an incentive for officers to continue to own
shares of the Company's common stock acquired upon exercise
of options under any of the Company's Stock Option Plans, thus
more closely aligning officers' financial interests with those of the
shareholders.  The RSP provides that officers who exercise stock
options and continue to hold the exercised shares for at least
three years will receive up to three Awards of shares of restricted
stock.  Each such Award is for one-third the number of shares
held for the requisite retention period.  Each restricted stock
Award granted pursuant to the plan becomes fully vested three
years after the grant date, provided that the officer maintains
continuous employment with the Company and that other
vesting requirements are met.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company has an employee stock purchase plan (the
Purchase Plan) under which substantially all employees may
purchase common stock through payroll deductions at a price
equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of the
beginning or end of the offering period.  Stock purchases under
the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of an employee's compen-
sation, up to a maximum of $25,000 in any calendar year.  As of
September 30, 1994, approximately 1 million shares were
reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.


Stock Repurchase Programs

In November 1992, the Board of Directors authorized the
purchase of up to 10 million shares of the Company's common
stock in the open market.  No shares were repurchased under this
authorization in 1994, while approximately 3.4 million shares
were repurchased under this authorization in 1993.  In September
1990, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to
10 million shares of the Company's common stock in the open
market.  During 1993 and 1992, the Company repurchased the
remaining shares under this authorization, which approximated
to 1.6 million and 4.0 million shares, respectively.

Savings Plan

The Company has an employee savings plan (the Savings Plan)
that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section
401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.  Under the Savings Plan,
participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pretax
earnings, up to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution
limit ($9,240 for calendar year 1994).  Effective July 1, 1994, the
Company matches 30% to 70% of each employee's contributions,
depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the
employee's earnings.  Prior to July 1, 1994, the Company matched
30% to 50% of each employee's contributions, depending on
length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employee's earn-
ings.  The Company's matching contributions to the Savings Plan
were approximately $10.7 million in 1994 and $11.1 million in
each of 1993 and 1992.

emphasis there are renal therapy and
cardiovascular medicine.  Baxter has a
strong position in the Japanese market
for peritoneal dialysis (PD).  The
company also plans to increase its
presence in the Japanese market for
basic hospital supplies.
  In terms of current markets, Japan
and the European Union comprise by
far the largest share of Baxter's
international business today.  But the
long-term opportunities are equally
attractive in the developing nations of
Asia, Latin America and the former
Soviet bloc, where Baxter is establishing
a major presence.

  I n developing nations, economic and
medical development are closely
related.  As countries create more
wealth and more income, one of the first
things they spend it on is health care.
Even relatively small increases in
spending on health care create
significant opportunities for Baxter.
  "We're not talking about levels of
medical spending that approach those in
the United States...," Baez says, "we're
talking about countries taking the
next step up.  For example, if Chile's
medical spending as a share of its gross
domestic product were raised to the level
of Spain's, it would increase roughly
50 percent."
  In the developing countries
overall, medical spending per capita is
projected to double in the 1990s.  One of
the most promising areas is East Asia
and the Pacific Rim, which will by itself
account for half the gain in gross world
product and half the growth in worldwide
trade during this decade.
  Baxter's presence in that area also
is growing rapidly.  The company is
building a $30-million plant in
Singapore to manufacture intravenous
and dialysis solutions for the Asian
market.  The company has offices in
Taiwan, Korea and Hong Kong.  It is
opening an office in Thailand and adding
staff in Indonesia.  In Korea, Taiwan and
the Philippines, it's involved in
technology transfers where Baxter sells
manufacturing equipment for intravenous


solutions to local companies, trains
their workers, then licenses them to
make products with their trade name.
The company also is working with
distributors in these areas to sell other
lines of products.
  In Australia and New Zealand,
Baxter today is one of the largest
health-care companies.  The company has
consolidated its manufacturing facilities
there and has extremely strong positions
in peritoneal dialysis and intravenous
solutions.  It plans to broaden its product
base in 1994.
  Also in 1994, Baxter hopes to
conclude joint-venture agreements in
India, Indonesia and Thailand for plants
to manufacture dialysis and IV solutions.
"These are significant opportunities,"
Baez says.  "There are almost 900 million
people in India, nearly 190 million in
Indonesia.  Thailand has about the same
population as England or France.  In all
these areas, we're using entry-level
technology and various kinds of business
arrangements to get established quickly.
From there, we'll branch out."
  Nowhere in Asia, however, is the
population -~ and the opportunity -~
larger than in China.  That country is
poised for an era of rapid growth.  Some
experts believe China's economy will
surpass Japan's by the end of the
decade, and become the largest in the
world by 2012.
  Baxter is building a plant in
Guangdong province and will begin
manufacturing intravenous and dialysis
solutions for the Chinese market in
1995.  Within the next two years, the
company hopes to develop two other
joint-venture manufacturing plants in
China, one for blood-therapy products
and one for additional manufacturing
capacity for intravenous and dialysis
solutions.  In all, the company expects to
invest more than $40 million in China
over the next three years.
  Elsewhere, Baxter is in the process
of acquiring a 50-percent interest in one
of the leading hospital-supply companies
in Turkey.  That company also exports to
neighboring countries, including several
former Soviet republics.


  Baxter's first operation in Russia.
a joint-venture plant to manufacture
surgical instruments, opened in 1993.
Baxter has formed in Russia a hospital-
supply sales and marketing force,
which will market a complete line of
Baxter products.  The company is
considering plans for additional
manufacturing in Russia for intravenous
and dialysis solutions.

  R ussia's economic problems are
formidable, and the political
climate creates additional
uncertainty.  Despite the obstacles, Baez
believes Baxter is correct in establishing
its presence early.  "We're being prudent;
our investment in Russia for 1993
amounted to about $5.5 million," he
says.  "But it's a big market, and the
window of opportunity is open just a
crack right now.  The companies who are
there today will have a big edge over
those who come later."
  The political and economic
situation in Poland, Czechoslovakia and
Hungary is more stable.  "The medical

Williamson says. "The bottom-line
pressure is tremendous. Hospitals have
to get control of their costs. They have to
compete for business. In local markets, 
reform is already happening. Major
alliances among former competitors are 
being formed to gain a competitive edge
in the new environment. As a 'value- 
added' service to hospitals, BCC has no 
strategy to grow except as demand
dictates, and the demand for our services
is growing rapidly."
  Baxter Corporate Consulting
services are offered exclusively to 
customers of Baxter's Corporate Program,
which offers hospitals a variety of 
incentives to increase their business with
Baxter. The program offers financial 
incentives, based on sales volume, as
well as a number of exclusive value-
added services, such as those provided
by Baxter Corporate Consulting. 
  Another value-added service 
available to Corporate Program 
customers is the AccessTM program,
which offers hospitals services that are
beyond Baxter's own expertise through
alliances with leading firms in other 
industries. Access associate Comdisco,

hospitals. Sales in those accounts have
grown 50 percent faster than sales in 
hospitals where the company has not 
used this approach.
  "Simply put, we're making Baxter 
a lot easier to do business with," says Joe
Damico, group vice president, Field 
Sales. "This structure provides one 
'quarterback,' one point person, to 
coordinate all of Baxter's activities for
each customer."
  The teamwork approach extends to 
the multihospital-system arena as well.
"We are lining up our directors and 
vice presidents to work with Baxter's 
hospital teams and meet the needs of
multihospital systems as 'One Baxter,'"
says Terrance J. Mulligan, group vice
president, Multi-Hospital Systems/
Corporate Marketing.
  In the past, as many as 30 Baxter 
sales representatives may have called on
one hospital. Under the new organization, 
an account manager, supported by sales 
representatives from each of Baxter's 
businesses, will represent Baxter as a 
team to that customer.
  The new structure puts customer 
needs ahead of divisional priorities. It
breaks down old divisional conflicts or
inefficiencies. For example, in 1993, 
California Healthcare System (CHS), a
regional alliance of four hospitals in the
San Francisco Bay area, sought to reduce
its supply expenses by seeking a prime-
vendor relationship for all four of its 
hospitals. Baxter won the contract, based 
largely on the teamwork involved in 
presenting the company's capabilities in 
a way that addressed all areas of need
outlined by CHS.
  "I look at CHS as a model for how 
we will be dealing with an increasing 
number of customers," says Mulligan.


focus on improving its cash flows from operations.
Management expects that net debt at the end of 1994 will
be the same as the 1993 year-end level, before the
consideration of net proceeds from divestitures. The company
also intends to utilize the net proceeds from the planned 
divestiture of the diagnostics-products manufacturing and
other non-strategic businesses to reduce net debt, and thus,
anticipates that its net debt to net capital will decline
during 1994, with the goal of reaching the 40% range in the 
years ahead.
  The company's debt ratings of A3 on senior debt by 
Moody's, A- by Standard & Poor's and A by Duff & Phelps
were reaffirmed by each rating agency after the 1993 restruc-
turing announcement. Standard & Poor's and Duff & Phelps 
have indicated that continuation of these ratings in the future
is dependent on Baxter's successful implementation of the
restructuring program announced in November 1993 (dis-
cussed previously) and the reduction of its financial leverage
which is expected to result from the planned divestiture of its
diagnostics-products manufacturing businesses.
  At December 31, 1993, the company could issue up 
to $300 million in aggregate principal amount of additional 
senior unsecured debt securities under an effective 
registration statement filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
  The company intends to fund its long-term obligations 
as they mature by issuing additional debt or through cash
flow from operations. The company believes it has lines of 
credit adequate to support ongoing operational and
restructuring requirements. Beyond that, the company 
believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to attract long-
term capital on acceptable terms as may be needed to support
its growth objectives.
  The company's board of directors authorized the 
purchase of common stock to fund various employee-benefit
plans and for other corporate purposes. The company 
purchased 4.5 million shares of common stock for $124


The consolidated balance sheets of Baxter International Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related
consolidated statements of income, cash flows and stockholders'
equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 1993, have been prepared by management, which 
is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. The statements
have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles and include some amounts that are based
upon management's best estimates and judgments. The financial
information contained elsewhere in this annual report is consis-
tent with that contained in the financial statements.
  Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
a system of internal control designed to provide reasonable 
assurance as to the integrity and reliability of financial reporting.
The concept of reasonable assurance is based on the recognition
that there are inherent limitations in all systems of internal 
control, and that the cost of such systems should not exceed the
benefits to be derived therefrom.
  Management believes that the foundation of an appropriate 
system of internal control is a strong ethical company culture 
and climate. To this end the Corporate Responsibility office was
created in 1993 to recommend to the Public Policy Committee of 
the Board of Directors, revisions to the company's existing ethics
and compliance policies, and to direct the implementation of and
compliance with the company's ethics and compliance policies 
and procedures. The Corporate Responsibility office monitors 
compliance through audit programs and the requirement for 
annual representations by senior managers. Additionally, a pro-
fessional staff of corporate auditors reviews the related internal
control system design, the accounting policies and procedures 
supporting this system and compliance therewith. The results of
these reviews are reported annually to the Public Policy and 
Audit Committees.


President's Letter


To Our Customers, Shareholder, Employees and Friends

  CITGO had a challenging and fantastic year in 1993. It reminded me of one of my favorite CITGO
advertisements, the one that says, "First we learned to walk. Then we learned to run. Now we're ready to fly."
This past year was a mini-version of the CITGO success story told by that advertisement. The first quarter of 1993
was among the poorest earnings periods in our history - you might say we were barely walking. We picked up our 
pace in the second quarter and hit our stride in the third. By the end of 1993, CITGO had experienced its most
successful year ever. Income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was up 35 percent.
Safety performance was outstanding, coming extremely close to 1992's record. Sales of CITGO products were up,
and our refineries were safe, clean, and reliable. We continued our strategic growth trend, acquiring a 28,000 bpd
asphalt refinery in Savannah, Georgia, in April and joining forces with Houston-based Lyondell Petrochemical 
Company to form LYONDELL-CITGO Refining Company, Ltd., in July. In sum, 1993 was a very good 
year for CITGO.
  CITGO's 1993 net income of $162.1 million on revenues of $9.1 billion compared very favorably to 1992's net
income of $33.2 million on revenues of $9.2 billion - a 35 percent increase when the accounting change adopted in 
1992 is excluded. Income from operations for 1993 was $340.1 million, compared with $310.0 million in 1992.
  While our financial performance was impressive, I am equally pleased with CITGO's 1993 safety performance.
CITGO's 1993 total OSHA Recordable Incidence rate of 2.2 very nearly matched 1992's record-breaking 
performance, while the lost workday case rate of 1.2 tied our 1992 record. Both CITGO's incidence and lost
workday rates were among the best in the industry.
  But it's not the numbers I'm proud of as much as it is the people - CITGO employees - who made them possible.
Safety is not a numbers game. It is about taking the right steps, every minute of every day, to ensure that all of us
return safely to our families at the end of the day. CITGO's five-year trend of sustained safety performance is proof
positive that our safety strategy is a long-term and effective one.
  While we invested close to $100 million in 1993 on environmentally related projects, it was once again our people
who helped to "keep it clean." Through recycling, source control, pollution prevention teams, education, and 
awareness, CITGO employees fulfilled our commitment to environmental stewardship. From the manufacturing, to 
the packaging, to the transportation of our products, we are dedicated to protecting the environment.
  The past year was also highlighted by outstanding sales performances from every CITGO business unit.
Gasoline sales to distributors increased 19 percent to five billion gallons in 1993, while rack distillate and jet turbine
sales volumes rose 24 percent and 12 percent, respectively. Lubricants sales volumes to distributors were up 
5 percent over 1992 levels, despite an industry-wide decline in demand, while refined wax sales saw a record-
  The Company's asphalt business enables CITGO to diversify its earnings base
while providing PDVSA an outlet for nearly 15 million barrels annually of its
extra-heavy crude. In 1993, PDVSA-CITGO synergies continued to expand as
CARCO marketed one million barrels of asphalt from PDVSA affiliate 
Lagoven in 1993.
  CARCO's refinery in Paulsboro, New Jersey, ran a record-setting 11.3 million
barrels of crude, a 4.1 percent increase over 1992 levels. An emphasis on safety
earned refinery employees an NPRA Gold Award, while an environmental 
focus led to the recycling of 4.6 million pounds of solid waste into 
highway paving material.
  Employees at CARCO's headquarters in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, worked 
hand-in-hand with employees at the Savannah refinery to ensure the smooth 
incorporation of the refinery into CITGO operations at the start of the asphalt
season. Production at Savannah was excellent, as the refinery, in eight 
months of CITGO operation, ran 3.5 million barrels of crude - 96 percent 
of the total 1992 runs.
  Equally impressive was the fact that CARCO's marketing and terminal
operations realized a savings of 30 cents per barrel in asphalt terminaling and 
transportation costs, as waste elimination efforts increased and six of eleven
terminals were automated. CARCO's "Vision 94" is bright indeed, as plans 
call for automation of at least three more terminals and expansion into 
the Albany, New York, market.


Asphalt

  While a declining market 
forced many asphalt 
companies to reduce 
operations, in 1993 CITGO
Asphalt Refining Company 
(CARCO) had an 
outstanding year. Sales 
volumes jumped 36 percent 
over 1992 levels to 10.3 
million barrels of asphalt,
and CITGO's asphalt 
refineries set production 
records and achieved 
significant safety 
milestones. In May, the 
Company became the
largest asphalt producer on
the East Coast when a 
28,000 bpd asphalt refinery
in Savannah, Georgia, was 
successfully incorporated 
into CITGO operations.

  Productivity and cost control improvements contributed to profitability
and were largely responsible for the Company's ability to buck negative trends
in the petrochemicals market. A new benzene splitter came on-line at the 
Lake Charles facility, increasing production 28 percent over 1992 levels. 
Polymer propylene production of 312 million pounds set a new record and
represented an 11 percent increase over 1992. At Corpus Christi, aromatics
production increased 4 percent, reducing CITGO's dependence on 
outside feedstock suppliers.
  Petrochemicals customers recognized CITGO's commitment to customer
satisfaction. Monsanto presented CITGO Petrochemicals its Preferred 
Cyclohexane Supplier Award for the fifth consecutive year, and cumene
customer General Electric Plastics continued to honor CITGO as a Partner in
Quality. In early 1994, CITGO's cyclohexane and cumene processes at the
Corpus Christi refinery were recommended for ISO 9002 certification,
reflecting thousands of hours of work in 1993 by a cross-functional team of
engineers, laboratory personnel and operations representatives.


Petrochemicals

  CITGO's petrochemicals 
production and sales 
reached record highs in 
1993, despite a declining 
international market. As 
employees sought new 
ways of eliminating waste
and improving quality,
sales volumes increased by
11 percent and profits by 
1.9 percent. CITGO 
produced and sold a 
record-setting amount of
cyclohexane in 1993 -
7 percent more than 
in 1992.

Off Balance Sheet Risk Information as of December 31, 1993
  The Company has guaranteed approximately $22 million of debt of certain affiliates, CITGO
distributors and other parties which is substantially collateralized by assets of these entities. The
Company has outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $174 million, which includes $131
million related to LYONDELL-CITGO (Note 2) and $30 million related to the Company's industrial 
development bonds (Note 9). The Company has also acquired surety bonds totaling $18 million
primarily due to requirements of various government entities. The Company is exposed to credit loss in
the event of nonperformance by the other parties to the interest rate swap agreements (Note 9),
however, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.

13. LEASES

 The Company leases certain of its Corpus Christi refinery facilities under a long-term lease. The basic
term of the lease expires on January 1, 2004; however, the Company may renew the lease until January
31, 2011, the date of its purchase option. Capitalized costs included in property, plant and equipment
related to the leased assets were approximately $209 million at December 31, 1993 and 1992.
Accumulated amortization related to the leased assets was approximately $62 million and $54 million at
December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Amortization is included in depreciation expense.
  The Company also has various noncancellable operating leases, primarily for office space, computer
equipment and vehicles. Rent expense on all operating leases totaled $34 million and $35 million in 1993
and 1992. Future minimum lease payments for the capital lease and noncancellable operating leases are
as follows:


Consolidated Statement of Changes in Capital Accounts

Management


The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.

The decrease in the deferred tax assets valuation allowance in 1993 of $11 million is primarily attributable to the
utilization (or expected future utilization) of loss carryforwards associated with certain of the Company's foreign
subsidiaries.

Deferred tax assets of $126 million and $78 million were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets
at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

Note 9 - Stockholder's Equity and Employee Benefit Plans:

Equity incentive plans - At December 31, 1993, there were 18,432,000 shares of common stock reserved by
the Board of Directors for issuance under the Company's employee stock option plans. Options are generally 
granted at the fair market value of the common stock at the date of grant and generally vest over four to five
years. In limited circumstances, options may be granted at prices less than fair market value and may vest
immediately. Options granted under the plans must be exercised not later than ten years from the date of grant.
Options on 4,292,000 shares were exercisable at December 31, 1993.

ated corn refining products; and 5) contin-


  Ongoing quality programs, such as Total Quality Excellence at
Corn Products in North America, Total Quality in Colombia, and a 
plan called Terra Nova in Brazil, continue to yield improved cus-
tomer satisfaction ratings. Quality-driven performance also earns 
the corn refining business the chance to partner with customers 
on future business opportunities. In Latin America customer sur-
veys were initiated to establish a quality and service benchmark
for future improvement.
  CPC's corn refining business is well positioned to take advan-
tage of the new, more open economies, as trade barriers fall
worldwide and countries change policies to increase cross-bor-
der business. CPC is the only corn refiner with plants in Canada,
Mexico, and the U.S., and the passage of the North American 
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will allow for more sharing of 
products and technology, more exports, and a more efficient
business.
  In Latin America, where privatization continues at a rapid pace 
and trade pacts are reducing tariffs, affiliates are pooling 
resources to produce more cost-competitive products. Grind of
waxy corn was eliminated in Mexico and Chile because the starch
could be produced and shipped more cheaply from Brazil. The 
Colombian affiliate expanded exports into the Andean Pact
nations of Ecuador and Peru, spurring strong volume growth.

SHARING EXPERTISE

  One of CPC's core strengths is its vast global organization built
from solid local management. Another is its ability to share tech-
nology and expertise across regions and countries. In the corn
refining business, a special unit called the Business Experience 
Transfer Group evaluates processes and systems, sharing the best 
and most successful of these with the rest of the corn refining

Environmental Protection:Like the other policies in the manual,
CPC's policy on protection of the environment is overseen by top
management and the Board's Corporate Affairs Committee and is
communicated comprehensively throughout the Company. This
policy states that CPC is committed to satisfying all applicable 
legislative and regulatory requirements or even higher, self-
imposed, standards, and that CPC will prevent or correct conditions
that pose a threat to the environment. 
  The great majority of CPC's facilities are consumer foods pro-
cessing plants and as such present relatively few serious environ-
mental risks. Thus environmental efforts in our consumer foods
business typically focus on improvements rather than corrections
-~ for example reductions in packaging materials, recycling 
programs and the use of recycled materials, and increased 
energy efficiency.
  In corn refining the challenges are greater. Environmental
efforts at CPC's Argo, Illinois, corn refining plant illustrate our
commitment to meeting them. Compliance with new regulations,
modernization of the plant, and CPC initiatives have resulted in: a
70% reduction in air pollutant emissions since 1976; a substantial
reduction in wastewater volume generated by the plant, coupled 
with a 30% reduction in biodegradable organic discharges since 
1980; a reduction in the volume of packaging material; and 
expansion of a plant-wide recycling program. The rebuild of a 
corn oil extraction facility, to be completed in 1994, will cut odor
emissions, and atmospheric emissions of volatile organic material
from corn germ processing will be reduced by more than 40%.

cent of CPC's nearly 8,000 U.S. employees are minorities and 30% 
are women. In recent years, and in 1993 especially, CPC has pro-
moted valuing differences in our employee population through
training programs and other experiences. The Company has sev-
eral programs to further the hiring and upward mobility of 
women and minorities, including four-year internship programs
for talented minority students.
Contributions: Financial and other support for our communities'
institutions and activities is an essential part of "The CPC Way." In 
1993, the Company made contributions valued at approximately 
$20 million in cash and food products, mainly to educational insti-
tutions; health, welfare, and community service organizations; and 
other cultural and charitable groups. A significant part of CPC's 
contributions is donated through CPC's Matching Gifts Program in
the U.S., which matches $2 for every $1 employees contribute. To
this financial support are added the volunteer and Company-spon-
sored service activities of employees at many of our facilities, often
in connection with local schools and educational projects.
Commitment to the Consumer: CPC is committed to marketing 
only the highest quality products at prices that truly reflect value.
We constantly strive to meet and anticipate consumers' prefer-
ences regarding health, taste, and convenience. CPC regularly
disseminates information to consumers, stressing the importance
of the total dietary approach to good health and physical fitness.

Consumers never see Grace Davison technology, but it makes possible efficient transportation
fuels, reliable low-cost packaging materials, high-quality coatings, better food products and much
more. Grace Davison is the world's leading supplier of petroleum fluid cracking catalysts, which
are critical to the production of gasoline and other refined petroleum products. Its polyolefin
catalysts are essential to the manufacture of polyethylene, which is used in packaging film and in 
pipe. Grace Davison silica and zeolite adsorbents are value-added components used in a wide

subsidiaries. The valuation allowance for 1993 and 1992 relates to the uncertainty as to the realization of
certain deferred tax assets, including U.S. tax credit carryforwards, state and local net operating loss
carryforwards and net deferred tax assets, and net operating loss carryforwards in certain foreign jurisdictions.
Based upon anticipated future results, the Company has concluded, after consideration of the valuation
allowance, that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset balance will be realized.
  In the third quarter of 1993, Grace recorded the effects of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993
(OBRA), which was enacted in August 1993. Among other things, OBRA increased the highest U.S. Federal 
corporate tax rate to 35%, effective January 1, 1993. However, neither this increase in the U.S. Federal
corporate tax rate (from 34%), nor the other provisions of OBRA, had a material effect on Grace's results of
operations.
  The 1992 effective tax rate increased to 43.1% (before the above provision for the valuation allowance) as
compared with 39.6% in 1991, largely due to the additional costs of repatriating to the U.S. a higher level of
earnings of foreign subsidiaries and an increase in state income taxes.
  See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on income taxes.

Loss from Discontinued Operations
In 1993, Grace restated its financial statements to reflect the classification of certain businesses as discontinued
operations. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
During 1993, the net pretax cash flow provided by Grace's continuing operating activities was $301.6 million
versus $358.9 million in 1992, primarily due to the use of $44.1 million of net cash to repurchase accounts
receivable in 1993, as compared to the receipt of $96.8 million of net proceeds from the sale of accounts
receivable in 1992, and a net cash outflow of $103.1 million relating to asbestos in 1993 (see below for
further discussion), compared with a net cash outflow of $70.3 million in 1992. Also, in 1993 cash flow
provided by operating activities includes $67.9 million in proceeds from the settlement of interest rate hedge
agreements. After giving effect to discontinued operations and payments of income taxes, the net cash provided 
by operating activities was $243.1 million in 1993.
  Investing activities used $151.9 million of cash in 1993, largely reflecting capital expenditures and business
acquisitions and investments, primarily in the health care and water treatment businesses. During 1993, Grace 
acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Home Intensive Care, Inc. for approximately $129 million (inclusive
of related costs). These investing activities were offset by net proceeds of $464.8 million from divestments
(mainly those of Grace Energy's oil and gas operations). Management anticipates that the level of capital 
expenditures in 1994 will increase to approximately $350 million as compared to the $309.6 million of capital
spending in 1993. Capital spending is expected to be concentrated on Grace's core businesses.
  Net cash used for financing activities in 1993 was $105.9 million, primarily reflecting the payment of
$128.4 million of dividends. Total debt was approximately $1.7 billion at year-end 1993, a decrease of $113.1
million from year-end 1992. Grace's total debt as a percentage of total capital (debt ratio) decreased from
54.1% at year-end 1992 to 52.9% at year-end 1993, primarily as a result of the reduction in total debt.
  In January 1993, Grace sold $300 million principal amount of 7.4% Notes Due 2000. The net proceeds 
from the sale of these Notes were used to repay commercial paper and bank borrowings.
  In the third quarter of 1993, Grace completed the redemption in full of its outstanding Liquid Yield Option
Notes due 2006 (LYONs) and 6~~~% Convertible Subordinate Debentures Due 2002. Of the $1,012.5 million 
principal amount at maturity of LYONs outstanding, approximately 31% ($309.6 million) was converted into 2.8
million shares of common stock; the remaining LYONs ($702.9 million) were redeemed for approximately $258
million in cash. Substantially all of the $150 million principal amount of the 6~~~% Convertible Debentures due 
2002 outstanding immediately prior to redemption was redeemed for cash (equal to the principal amount
outstanding).
  Grace expects to satisfy its 1994 cash requirements from the following sources: (1) funds generated by
operations, (2) proceeds from the sales of businesses and (3) financings. Such financings could include new
borrowings, the availability and cost of which will depend upon general economic and market conditions. 

Asbestos-Related Matters
As reported in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Grace is a defendant in lawsuits relating to 
previously sold asbestos-containing products. In 1993, Grace paid $103.1 million in connection with the


as follows:

Let's also look at growth as a historical
matter.
  In the John Deere industrial 
equipment division, the classic story
goes like this: the oldest son inherited 
the farm, so his younger brother
decided to go into contracting -~
drainage work, land-clearing,
excavation for footings and utilities -~
starting with a small dozer, a backhoe,
perhaps later a four-wheel-drive
loader for site preparation work and
basement excavations; eventually,
an excavator.
  This "owner-operator" contractor
started out small, found his niche, and
built his business on firm footings, in 
relation to demand and flexible enough
to move within the available market.
  Doug McMaster (at right, in 
black jacket) is just such a man. He 
started out in 1981 with a John Deere 
310A backhoe and built his company,
Masco, Inc., into one of the largest 
underground water and sewer 
contracting companies in the Boise,
Idaho, area; annual contract volume
now runs about $6.5 million. The 
company today owns 19 machines -~
all but two are John Deere.
  John Deere's industrial equipment 
division has developed in parallel with
customers like Doug McMaster. Our
product line has grown with customers'
needs, but the primary products are
still the mainstays of any earthmoving 
contractor's fleet. This style of operation
-~ understanding and responding
to customers' needs -~ has been the 
John Deere way from the beginning.
  An important part of growth is
learning how to grow. We've been 
learning continuously for 157 years.
We've found that the one-on-one 
treatment that has always made 
sense to farmers and contractors 
also makes sense to lawn care 
professionals and homeowners, to 
public agencies, to OEMs who
specify John Deere engines for their
own products, and to clients of our
insurance, credit, and managed health
care services.

To position ourselves for continued
long-term growth in the lawn and
grounds care equipment business, we
are doing these things: 
  We will continue to offer products
that meet or exceed customer expec-
tations in both quality and value.
  To better focus our resources,
product offerings, and marketing and
distribution practices, we have
reorganized operations into three
strategic business units:

~ Commercial equipment for
professional groundskeepers,
landscapers, and golf course and
sports turf superintendents.

~ Premium lawn and garden
equipment, such as lawn tractors
and riding mowers.

~ Power products including mowers,
trimmers, leaf blowers, edgers, and
other walk-behind and hand-held
products for both homeowners and 
professional groundskeepers.

  This new marketing structure 
recognizes how customers really shop
for what they need: a homeowner who 
wants a string trimmer is more likely 
to go to a hardware store, while the 
professional grounds keeper would
consider nothing less than a servicing
John Deere dealership. Customers differ
in their expectations of the product,
and also in what they expect from 
their relationship with the seller. We are
now organized to accommodate those
expectations.
  Primarily in residential products, we
are developing a much larger customer
base through the new distribution 
channels we have gained by acquiring 
Homelite.
  Our strategy is simply to get the 
right product to the right place in order to
reach the right customers. By this plan,
we intend to realize the sales potential of
every market we enter.


The consolidated financial statements and other financial 
information of Deere & Company in this report were prepared 
by management, which is responsible for their contents. They 
reflect amounts based upon management's best estimates and 
informed judgments. In management's opinion, the financial
statements present fairly the financial position, results of operations
and cash flows of the company in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles.
  The company maintains a system of internal accounting 
controls and procedures which is intended, consistent with
reasonable cost, to provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are executed as authorized, that they are included in the financial
records in all material respects, and that accountability for assets is
maintained. The accounting controls and procedures are supported 
by careful selection and training of personnel, examinations by 
an internal auditing department and a continuing management
commitment to the integrity of the system.
  The financial statements have been audited to the extent
required by generally accepted auditing standards by Deloitte &
Touche LLP, independent auditors. The independent auditors have
evaluated the company's internal control structure and performed 
tests of procedures and accounting records in connection with the 
issuance of their report on the fairness of the financial statements.
  The Board of Directors has appointed an Audit Review
Committee composed entirely of directors who are not employees
of the company. The Audit Review Committee meets with 
representatives of management, the internal auditing department
and the independent auditors, both separately and jointly. The 
Committee discusses with the independent auditors and approves
in advance the scope of the audit, reviews with the independent
auditors the financial statements and their audit report, 
consults with the internal audit staff and reviews management's
administration of the system of internal accounting controls.
The Committee reports to the Board on its activities and findings.


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
of Deere & Company and subsidiaries as of October 31, 1994 and
1993 and the related statements of consolidated income and of
consolidated cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended October 31, 1994. These financial statements are the 
responsibility of the company's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
  We conducted our audits in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and signifi-
cant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
  In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements 
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Deere & Company and subsidiaries at October 31, 1994 and 1993
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of

CPW unit volume increased 24 percent and sales grew to nearly $390
million. In the United Kingdom, CP-UK challenged for the No. 2 share 
position with good performance from its core Shredded Wheat and 
Shreddies brands. Original European markets showed continued 
double-digit growth, although the rates of increase were lower than 
in recent years. CPW again paced growth and reported share gains 
in each country. The company completed its first full year of operation
in Mexico, Germany and the ASEAN markets in the southwestern 
Pacific. With operations now expanding to Switzerland, Austria, Belgium,
Greece and Chile, CPW competes in markets accounting for 75 percent 
of cereal consumption outside North America. This represents good
progress toward CPW's goal of $1 billion in sales by the year 2000.

The following table sets forth the combined funded status of the company's principal plans at April 27, 1994 and April 28, 1993.


Assumptions for foreign plans are developed on a basis consistent with those for U.S. plans, adjusted for prevailing economic conditions.
  In April 1992, the Board of Directors amended the domestic salaried defined benefit pension plan to provide that no benefits 
would accrue under this plan on or after January 1, 1993. At the same time, the Board expanded, effective January 1, 1993, the
defined contribution plan covering substantially all domestic salaried employees, described below. The Board's actions on the defined 
benefit pension plan resulted in an after-tax curtailment gain of $23.6 million, which was recorded in 1992. No plan assets were
withdrawn from the pension plan as a result of this curtailment.
  The company maintains defined contribution plans for the majority of its domestic non-union and salaried employees.
Benefits are provided through company contribution accounts which consist solely of company contributions that are a percentage of
the participant's pay based on age, with the contribution rate increasing with age. In addition, certain non-union employees receive
supplemental contributions, which are paid at the discretion of the company, and matching contributions based on a percentage of the
participant's contributions to the 401(k) portion of the plan. (The company's matching contributions for salaried employees are
provided under the ESOP.) The expense recognized as a result of company contributions to the defined contribution plans, excluding
the ESOP, totaled $16.5 million in 1994. In 1993, $4.5 million was expensed for the company defined contribution plans.

CAVENHAM reported a fourth consecutive
year of improved performance built 
around extensive timberland holdings 
located in some of the most productive
timber growing regions in the world.
Fertile soil, moderate temperatures
and plentiful rainfall are important 
characteristics of its acreage. The 
wood products facilities are considered
amongst the most efficient and
productive in the industry, highlighted 
by the state-of-the-art technology of
the McComb, Mississippi sawmill.
 
On a sustainable yield basis,
Cavenham harvests approximately
550 million board feet annually.
Continuing reforestation, silviculture,
fertilisation and thinning enhance the
forests' ever-increasing value and
provide the foundation for future
earnings growth. Lumber production
is an important means of adding
value to the timber resource.

A vibrant housebuilding market
fuelled the demand for wood products, 
sending lumber prices up early in the 
year, particularly in the Southeast
where more than 85% of Cavenham's 
lumber production is generated. This 
strong demand created rapidly rising
domestic log prices. In addition, 
continuing restrictions, influenced 
by environmentalists, on Northwest
government-owned timberlands 
contributed to a tight supply. Timber
prices peaked in the second quarter,
but declining demand domestically 
and overseas caused prices to fall
later in the year.

Cavenham has strong cash flow and
this year generated a record ~101
million after investing ~18 million.


Our capital programme continues to
support sawmill efficiency and 
timberland acquisitions. During the
year, small high value timberlands 
were acquired, along with 44,000 acres
of formerly leased forests. Lumber 
production, yield and employee
productivity improved once again.

Steady improvement in sales, earnings
and return on capital employed have 
been experienced over the past 
several years at DUKE CITY LUMBER and 
BROWN MOULDING where both enjoyed
strong sales increases and earnings 
growth of more than 20%.

LONDON BRICK has developed a new
frost-resistant brick by modifying the
traditional Fletton manufacturing
process. This brick, known as the
Kempston Rural Range has won
several awards, including a Business 
Commitment to the Environment
award.

There has been increased investment
at HANSON ELECTRICAL SERVICES on new
automated plant and machinery,
product development and acquisitions.
CRABTREE'S reputation as a market 
leader in UK circuit breakers has been
strengthened further by the purchase
of the SCHOLES GROUP in September
1994 for ~100 million including the
Wylex and Dorman Smith brand circuit
breakers. The VOLEX ACCESSORIES and
MARBOURN ranges of wiring products 
were broadened with the acquisition 
of TRAVELLER INTERNATIONAL, a

The exercise prices of options outstanding at December 31, 
1994 ranged from $14.63 to $54.63. These options expire if not
exercised at specific dates ranging from April 1999 to July 2003.
The price range for options exercised during the three-year period
ended December 31, 1994 was $14.63 to $14.69.
Stock participation plan. Under this plan, qualified employees may
purchase shares of Intel's Common Stock at 85% of fair market
value at specific, predetermined dates. Of the 59.0 million shares
authorized to be issued under the plan, 15.4 million shares are
available for issuance at December 31, 1994. Employees purchased 
2.0 million shares in 1994 (2.2 million and 2.6 million in 1993 and 
1992, respectively) for $94 million ($71 million and $57 million in 
1993 and 1992, respectively).
Retirement plans. The Company provides profit-sharing retirement
plans (the "Profit-Sharing Plans") for the benefit of qualified
employees in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. The plans are designed to
provide employees with an accumulation of funds at retirement
and provide for annual discretionary contributions to trust funds.
The Company also provides a non-qualified profit-sharing retire-
ment plan (the "Non-Qualified Plan") for the benefit of qualified 
employees in the U.S. This plan is designed to permit certain
discretionary employer contributions in excess of the tax limits
applicable to the profit-sharing retirement plans discussed above
and to permit certain employee deferrals in excess of certain tax
limits. This plan is intended to be an unfunded plan.
  The Company accrued $152 million for the Profit-Sharing Plans 
and the Non-Qualified Plan in 1994 ($103 million in 1993 and
$93 million in 1992). Of the $152 million accrued in 1994, the 
Company expects to fund approximately $126 million for the 1994 
contribution to the Profit-Sharing Plans and to allocate approxi-
mately $5 million for the Non-Qualified Plan. The remainder, plus
approximately $120 million carried forward from prior years, is
expected to be contributed to these plans when allowable under
IRS regulations and plan rules.
  Contributions made by the Company vest based on the employ-
ee's years of service. Vesting begins after three years of service in
20% annual increments until the employee is 100% vested after
seven years.
  The Company provides qualified defined benefit pension plans
for the benefit of qualified employees in the U.S. and Puerto Rico.
Each plan provides for minimum pension benefits, which are de-
termined by a participant's years of service, final average compen-
sation (taking into account the participant's social security wage
base), and the value of the Company's contributions, plus earnings,
in the Profit-Sharing Plan. If the balance in the participant's Profit-
Sharing Plan exceeds the pension guarantee, the participant will
receive benefits from the Profit-Sharing Plan only. Intel's funding
policy is consistent with the funding requirements of federal laws
and regulations. 


While our company becomes involved in new technologies, 
new services and new areas of the world, we cannot lose sight
of the fundamental component of our drive to exceed customer 
expectations: continuous improvements in quality, service,
productivity and time compression. For example, to under-
score our belief that we deliver superior quality in automotive
batteries, in 1994 we introduced a manufacturer's warranty
substantially longer than any other in the industry. Our cus-
tomers are already crediting increased growth to this feature.

On the following pages, you'll find many other examples of 
the ways Johnson Controls is growing by striving to continu-
ally exceed our customers' increasing expectations.

I would like to express my appreciation to Ettore Barbatelli,
Sr. and William L. Rootham, two members of the Board of 
Directors who retired in 1994. Ettore Barbatelli served on the 
Board since 1973. Bill Rootham joined Johnson Controls in
1949, served as Vice Chairman, and helped strengthen the

Management's Discussion and Analysis
 

Strategic and financial objectives

Management's primary objective is to
increase shareholder value over time. To
achieve this objective, the Company has
implemented a long-term business strategy
which focuses on continuing aggressive
investment in new cereal markets, increasing
returns on existing investments, maximizing
cash flows, and minimizing the cost of 
capital through appropriate financial policies.
The success of this strategy is reflected in 
the Company's superior earnings, return on
equity, total return to shareholders, and
its overall strong financial condition.

Global marketplace

Because of its strong global market share
leadership, the Company is uniquely posi-
tioned to benefit from the continued in-
crease in cereal consumption around the 
world. As of December 31, 1993, our
market share was 43% globally, 38% in 
North America, 47% in Asia-Pacific, 50%
in Europe, and 78% in Latin America. This 
favorable positioning in existing markets 
is accompanied by leadership in entering
new markets with substantial long-term
potential. Kellogg opened a new cereal
plant in Latvia in 1993 and has plants sched-
uled to begin production in India in 1994
and in China in 1995. We plan to make our 
products available to a billion new con-
sumers by early in the next century, more
than doubling our present reach.

Lifestyle and demographic changes in major
markets around the world favor a continued
increase in consumption of ready-to-eat ce-
real, our core product line. Two particularly
important trends are ever-increasing recogni-
tion by consumers around the world of the
nutritional value of cereal and the accelerat-
ing move of the "baby boom" generation 
from young adulthood, where cereal con-
sumption is relatively low, to middle age,


where cereal consumption grows steadily.
The Company believes it has developed 
the worldwide infrastructure and financial
resources needed to continue its leader-
ship of category growth.

Results of operations

1993 compared to 1992

Revenues
Kellogg revenues are obtained primarily from
the sale of ready-to-eat cereals in more than
150 countries. Kellogg has been marketing
cereals since 1906 and is the global market
share leader by nearly a three-to-one advan-
tage. Increased revenues are obtained by 
reaching consumers in both new and devel-
oped markets with products that are both
nutritious and superior in quality. The intro-
duction of new products is vital to the 
Company's long-term financial strength. For 
1993, the Company introduced 24 new 
products worldwide.

Despite intense competition, continued 
recessions in several major markets, and unfa-
vorable currency movements, worldwide
revenues increased by 2% for 1993, marking 
the 49th consecutive annual increase. The
increase was achieved through higher selling 
prices and a 2% increase in cereal volume,
being negatively impacted by foreign 
currency movements. Forty percent of all
revenues are derived from outside the
United States and are subject to foreign cur-
rency fluctuations. Excluding the negative
effects of currency movements, 1993 sales
would have increased 6%. During 1993,
sales within the United States rose by 6%
from increased selling prices and volume
for both cereal and convenience foods.

Management believes that the following commentary
and tables appropriately discuss and analyze the com-
parative results of operations and the financial condition
of the Corporation for the periods covered.

1992 Restructuring and Accounting Changes
The comparability of income statement data is affected 
by the following items that occurred in 1992:
~ The Corporation announced a restructuring plan to 
strengthen its competitive position in consumer and
service products operations in Europe and certain 
operations in North America. The plan included
eliminating approximately 800 positions, principally in 
Europe; restructuring manufacturing facilities at
Rouen, France, and Larkfield, England; discontinuing 
diaper production at mills in Fullerton, Calif., and 
Memphis, Tenn.; writing off the No. 2 newsprint
machine at the Coosa Pines, Ala., mill; and integrating 
certain U.S. and Canadian consumer and service prod-
ucts operations. Additional information concerning 
events and decisions which gave rise to the restructur-
ing plan is presented in Note 9 to the Financial
Statements.

The $250.0 million pretax cost of the restructuring was
charged to 1992 operating profit. The restructuring 
charge decreased 1992 product class and geographic 
operating profit as follows:


Product Classes referred to in this Management's Discus-
sion and Analysis are:
~ Class I includes tissue products for household, com-
mercial, institutional and industrial uses; infant, child,
feminine and incontinence care products; industrial
and commercial wipers; health care products; and 
related products.
~ Class II includes newsprint, printing papers, premium 
business and correspondence papers, tobacco industry 
papers and products, technical papers, and related 
products.
~ Class III includes aircraft services, commercial air
transportation and other products and services.

station for the M1A2 main
battle tank.

Properties and Depreciation   Property, plant and equip-
ment, including capital leases, are carried at cost, including
interest cost capitalized during construction on significant
capital programs.
  Depreciation and amortization of properties are computed
over estimated service lives generally using accelerated 
methods, except for Materials and other businesses that
utilize the straight-line method. Depletion of mineral deposits
is calculated over estimated recoverable quantities by the unit-
of-production method.

Intangible Assets Costs in excess of net assets acquired are
amortized ratably over appropriate periods ranging from 20
to 40 years. Other intangibles represent amounts assigned 
principally to the value of programs acquired and are
amortized over periods not exceeding 15 years.

Income Taxes Current income tax provisions represent 
estimated amounts payable or recoverable for each year after
adjustments for permanent differences. Deferred income tax 
provisions represent the tax effect of all significant temporary
differences between financial statements and income taxes.

Research and Development and Similar Costs Research and
development and similar costs are charged to operations as
incurred unless reimbursable under specific contractual 
arrangements. Independent research and development,
systems studies, other concept formulation studies and bid
and proposal work relating to government contracts represent
a major portion of these expenses. Such amounts are
allocated when appropriate to government contracts through 
overhead under government-mandated cost accounting 
procedures.
  Preoperating costs are generally charged to operations
as incurred, except that such costs for significant new
products or services and start-up costs of certain facilities
may be deferred for amortization over periods not to exceed 
five years.

Earnings Per Common Share   Earnings per share are
based on the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the year.
  Earnings per share, assuming no dilution, were computed 
in 1993 based on net earnings less the dividend requirement 
of preferred stock. The weighted average number of common 
shares outstanding assuming no dilution were 95,346,614 in 
1993, 95,868,708 in 1992 and 99,341,210 in 1991.
  Fully diluted earnings per share in 1993 asssumed that
the average number of common shares was increased by the 
conversion of preferred stock from the date of issue and by
dilutive stock options. The weighted average number of
common shares outstanding, assuming full dilution, were
118,347,041 in 1993, 95,868,708 in 1992 and 99,341,210
in 1991.
  On September 30, 1993, a 2-for-1 split of the Corporation's
common stock in the form of a 100% stock dividend became
effective. All references in the consolidated financial state-
ments with regard to the number of shares and per share data
have been restated to reflect the split.


Note B:
Business Combination with GE Aerospace

On November 22, 1992, Martin Marietta Corporation 
entered into a Transaction Agreement with General Electric
Company (GE) to combine the aerospace and certain other
businesses of GE (collectively, the "GE Aerospace businesses")
with the businesses of Martin Marietta Corporation in the
form of affiliated corporations. The transaction (the "GE
Transaction"), was consummated on April 2, 1993, and GE 
Aerospace operations have been included since that date.
  The exchange consideration of approximately $3 billion
for the GE Transaction consisted of cash, preferred stock,
retention by GE of certain accounts receivable and the
assumption of payment obligations related to certain GE 
indebtedness. The GE Transaction has been accounted for 
under the purchase method of accounting, wherein
approximately $1.9 billion in goodwill was recognized by the
Corporation after recording approximately $700 million in 
other intangibles (representing the estimated fair-market
value of certain assets) and other purchase adjustments 
necessary to allocate the purchase price to the value of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is being amortized 
over a 40-year period, and the other intangibles are being
amortized over a 15-year period.
  The Martin Marietta securities owned by GE are held
under a Standstill Agreement. Among other things, the
Standstill Agreement provides for certain limitations on
either the increase or disposal of GE's interest in voting
securities of Martin Marietta, on GE's solicitation of proxies
and shareowner proposals, on GE's voting of its shares and on
GE's ability to place or remove members of Martin Marietta's
Board of Directors. In addition, the Standstill Agreement
requires Martin Marietta to recommend to its shareowners
the election of persons designated by GE to serve as directors
of Martin Marietta. Generally, the Standstill Agreement
provides that GE's designees will at all times constitute at least
10% of Martin Marietta's Board of Directors.
  In 1986, the Board of Directors adopted a Shareholder
Rights Plan to distribute, under certain circumstances, one
Common Stock Purchase Right for each outstanding share of 
the Corporation's common stock.  The Rights Plan was
amended during 1990. Under the amended plan, the Rights 
became exercisable if a person or group acquires, in a 
transaction not approved by the Board of Directors, 15% or
more of the Corporation's common stock or announces a
tender offer for 30% or more of the stock. The GE 
Transaction was approved by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation and therefore did not constitute a "Change of
Control" for purposes of the shareholder rights plan. The 
new Martin Marietta Corporation has not adopted a 
shareholder rights plan. 
  The following unaudited pro forma information presents 
the results of operations of the Corporation and the GE 
Aerospace businesses for the years ended December 31, 1993
and 1992, with pro forma adjustments as if the GE 
Transaction had been consummated as of the beginning of 
the periods presented. This pro forma information does not
purport to be indicative of what would have occurred had the
acquisition been made as of those dates or of results which
may occur in the future.


Government Services, head-
quartered in Cherry Hill, New
Jersey, provides technical and
engineering services in support of
other former GE Aerospace units
and U.S. Government customers,
including the Department of 
Defense, NASA, the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin-
istration and other agencies.

Government Services provides 
range support at key defense instal-
lations, including the Fort Irwin
National Training Center, the
Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training 
Facility and Tyndall Air Force Base. 
Government Services' most recent 
award in this area is for operation and
maintenance services at the Air Force's 
Pacific Alaskan Range Complex.

This unit also provides development 
support for Air Force computer sim-
ulation training and operation and
maintenance and field support for
the Navy's shipboard Surveillance 
Towed Array Sensor System. In 


1992, Navy contracts were awarded 
for combat system and fleet service 
engineering and for integration 
system support for a new Japanese
destroyer construction program.

For NASA's Johnson Space Center,
Government Services supports pro-
grams such as Spacelab Life Sci-
ences, Space Station Freedom and
the joint U.S. Space Shuttle/Russian
Mir Space Station mission. For 
NASA's Goddard Space Flight Cen-
ter, Government Services develops 
small, unmanned payloads such as
Hitchhiker and the new Small
Explorer class of spacecraft. Govern-
ment Services also operates satellite
control centers for a variety of NASA
and NOAA spacecraft.

Building on the success of an aerial
radar system used by the U.S. Cus-
toms Service for drug interdiction,
Government Services received a 
contract in 1992 to supply the Air
Force with four similar systems.

FINDING NEW LIVES FOR PLASTICS

tions such as the American Plastics Council and
the Polyurethane Recycling and Recovery Coun-
cil, which are addressing recycling on an industry-
wide basis.
  We also are dedicated to creating new
recycling technologies that use post-consumer
plastics waste to manufacture new products and
to sharing these technologies with our customers.
  For example, the front close-out panel on
certain Jeep Renegade models is made of
100 percent recycled polyurethane bumpers from
Chrysler minivans. Another viable option being 
pursued by the industry is the recycling of auto-


motive seat cushion foam into carpet underlay.
This is a promising venture due to the consider-
able size of the carpet underlay market in the 
United States.
  As part of the Polymers Division's "from con-
cept to finished product" customer service, our
technical experts also work with customers to
help them design products for recyclability.
  With this dual approach - teamwork with 
other industry suppliers and teamwork with our
customers to address their specific needs -
we can continue to contribute effectively to
progress in recycling.

tion for the environment. 

LEADING-EDGE ADVANCEMENTS

In conjunction with environmental con-
siderations, our businesses and our cus-
tomers were challenged by the overall
sluggishness of the chemical industry.
This made cost economies and leading-
edge performance advancements critical 
for retaining or gaining market share.
  Responding to cost efficiency demands
in the automotive industry, we introduced a
low-density filler for our Bayflex reaction in-
jection molding (RIM) polyurethane systems.
This filler helps automakers reduce the costs 
for bumper fascias.
  Also in the automotive market, the


blocked polyisocyanates of the coatings
business were the formulation bases for 
new one-component polyurethane clear-
coats. Offering properties comparable to 
two-component polyurethane clearcoats,
these coatings can be applied using one-
component equipment. As a result, auto-
makers no longer need major equipment 
investments to obtain the performance ben-
efits of polyurethane clearcoat technology.
  Our Palomar blue pigment was a suc-
cessful new product, fueled by the popu-
larity of vibrant blue-green car finishes.
And Quindo violet pigment will help our 
organic pigments business maintain its
worldwide leadership role in supplying 
pigments that meet - and anticipate - the
latest styling trends in automotive coat-
ings. This business also was strengthened 
in 1993 with the dedication of a new 
organic pigments manufacturing plant


and pilot production facility at our Bushy
Park, S.C., site.
  In direct response to long-standing 
industry needs, Polysar Bromobutyl 2040
was introduced to supplement our line of 
halobutyl products for use in tire innerlin-
ers. In the polybutadiene rubber market,
we retained our position as market leader
in North America, with the majority of 
sales achieved in the tire industry. Our
rubber chemicals business gained market 
share, with antidegradant and accelerator
products among the top performers.
  Facilitating the fully automatic and
waste-free manufacture of intricate rubber
parts, our Baysilone liquid silicone rubber 
attained an outstanding growth rate in 
1993 for products ranging from computer 
keypads to baby bottle nipples.
  For the medical device industry, we
introduced a gamma radiation sterilizable

Supporting the multi-disciplinary teams of
biologists, biochemists and chemists is a 
structural chemistry department with 
expertise in X-ray crystallography, nuclear
magnetic resonance, advanced mass spec-
trometry and other state-of-the-art technol-
ogy. These tools enable our scientists to 
perform advanced work in genetics, pro-
tein identification and other cutting-edge
pharmaceutical research.

INDUSTRY LEADERSHIP

Our diagnostics businesses have been on
the forefront of a worldwide industry


trend to restructure and realign operations.
Now strategically positioned, Miles' diag-
nostics businesses are building on a world
leadership position in urine chemistry,
histology and blood glucose monitoring
and are poised to respond effectively to
changes in the worldwide health care 
industry. With the introduction of the
Technicon Immuno 1 immunoassay ana-
lyzer, Miles has made an impressive entry
into the growing immunodiagnostics
business segment.
  Our medical plastics business has
entered into a licensing agreement with the
American Red Cross to further develop,
manufacture and distribute a solution that
will prolong and improve red blood cell
storage. We will develop the technology

  To speed patient diagnosis in busy
hospitals and health care centers, we intro-
duced the Matrix LR 3300 laser imager,
which processes more than 300 films per 
hour. Another efficiency enhancer is our
new Scopix LT-IR infrared laser film,
which provides excellent results for many
diagnostic methods, including magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound.
Less time is spent retrieving and loading
different kinds of films for different tech-
niques, a valuable savings for patients 
and physicians.
  In another milestone for the technical 
imaging industry, we developed the


For photo dealers and lab operators,
we expanded our successful Partner Pro-
gram, which offers detailed, personal 
training and guidance in retail merchan-
dising, sales promotion and technical
service. Our service was recognized by 
honors such as Woolworth's 1993 Vendor
Excellence Award and the International 
Award for Outstanding Performance from 
the American Society of Photofinishers.
  Our vision for graphic systems was to 
provide a single resource for our cus-
tomers by integrating our prepress sys-
tems with the sales and service solutions 
our customers need to make their own


ENVIRONMENTAL EFFORTS

At Agfa, we place a major emphasis on 
environmental responsibility. Representa-
tive of these efforts is our photo imaging
system's EARTH program (Environmental
Assistance and Response That Helps).
EARTH helps customers reduce plastic bot-
tle and liquid waste during processing. In
our graphic systems business, we developed 
a comprehensive manual that helps prepress 
customers learn how to apply current
knowledge in the waste reduction field to
their own business practices.
  To better serve our customers in North
America, we opened a plant at our Bushy


IMPAX image management and archiving 
system, used to electronically send medi-
cal images from location to location for
instant diagnosis and archiving.
  We also did well in our motion picture 
film business. Agfa's CP-10 film, on which 
"The Fugitive," "Free Willy," "Sommersby" 
and other movies in 1993 were printed,
gained immediate acceptance for its sharp-
ness and dye stability, and the reduced envi-
ronmental impact of its processing. CP-10 
is a polyester-based film with no conven-
tional carbon black backing, resulting in a 
significant reduction in water consumption.

CUSTOMER SERVICE A TOP PRIORITY

In addition to emphasizing technological
advancement, Agfa put forth unprecedented 
efforts in 1993 to solidify customer service 
as a top priority.


businesses successful. In 1993 that vision
became a reality.
  We also developed a stronger dealer
partnership by supporting our dealers with
enhanced technical, training and consult-
ing programs, including the Agfa Center 
for Education, or ACE, a facility in Teter-
boro, N.J., for instruction and training on
all Agfa electronic and photographic pre-
press systems.
  Driven in part by major restructuring 
in the way national and regional hospital
associations are run, customer service 
requirements rapidly changed in the med-
ical imaging field. In response, we in-
creased our marketing efforts toward large
hospital and health care systems, regional-
ized our field sales and service staffs and
instituted other changes to optimize cus-
tomer support.


Park, S.C., site. This operation slits and
packages color photographic paper and 
soon will add X-ray and graphic arts films
to its repertoire. We have made protecting 
the environment a focus at this new plant.
In addition to using recycled packaging
for our color photo paper, we introduced a 
recycling program that reduces the amount
of waste associated with the fiber cores
inside rolls of photo paper. Our plant was
the first of its kind to initiate such exten-
sive environmental efforts for photo-
graphic paper.
  From packaging innovation, to the
reduction of silver, ammonium compounds 
and fixer, to new technologies that help 
our customers meet their environmental
commitments, the Agfa Division is laying
the groundwork for a cleaner, better world
in which to live and work.


But the rewards can also be sweet.
  The Chemical Group, as now aligned, has demon-
strated its increasing earnings capability even without 
much help from the worldwide economies. This is a very
strong unit. Only one or two businesses need further work
to make them full players, and we are going about that 
work now. The Chemical Group will be solid and reliable.
  NutraSweet, which was part of the G.D. Searle & Co. 
acquisition in 1985, has generated enough cash to pay for
the entire Searle acquisition and subsequent investments,
including the cost of capital. This assumes typical values 
for the current assets. In addition, NutraSweet's prospects 
have been successfully stabilized following the 1992 expi-
ration of its U.S. patent for NutraSweet brand sweetener.
  It is now time for Searle, our pharmaceutical unit, to
begin to pay its own way and secure its own future. We
have carefully studied Searle's current and emerging 
product line. We have concluded that Searle is sustainable
as a medium-size pharmaceutical company meeting cor-
porate targets, despite the realities of health care cost
containment. Our original intention when we acquired 
Searle, however, was for much more. Our job now is to
determine whether we can form alliances and related 
actions with other pharmaceutical companies that would 
result in cost savings, product gains, and a larger phar-
maceutical presence. Such alliances will be a significant
determinant in our future plans for Searle. An intense 
effort is under way to find the right partners.

Statement of Consolidated Financial Position

Statement of Consolidated Cash Flow

ACCOUNTING CHANGES      Occidental changed 
its method of accounting for postretirement benefits
other than pensions by adopting SFAS No. 106-
"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions," effective January 1, 1992. This
statement substantially changed the existing method 
of accounting for postretirement benefits by requiring 
that the cost of these benefits, which are primarily 
health care related, be recognized in the financial
statements during the employees' active working 
careers, rather than the previously permitted practice 
of accounting for such costs as claims were paid. The 
adoption of SFAS No. 106 resulted in an after-tax 
charge against 1992 earnings of $529 million, includ-
ing $513 million which was charged to the 1992 first
quarter earnings for the cumulative effect of this 
accounting change and a charge of $16 million for 
the ongoing effect included in 1992 earnings.
  Occidental also adopted, effective January 1, 1992,
SFAS No. 109-~"Accounting for Income Taxes," which 
requires an asset and liability approach in accounting 
for income taxes. Under this method, deferred
income taxes are recognized, at enacted rates, to
reflect the future effects of tax carryforwards and tem-


porary differences arising between the tax bases of 
assets and liabilities and their financial reporting
amounts at each year-end. SFAS No. 109 required the 
restatement of assets and liabilities related to pur-
chased businesses to eliminate the previously used
net-of-tax accounting for such assets and liabilities,
resulting in higher carrying values and therefore in
higher operating charges for depreciation, depletion 
and amortization but lower tax expense. This state-
ment also eliminated the concept of the utilization of
net operating loss carryforwards for accounting pur-
poses, which were previously reported as extraordi-
nary items, by requiring the immediate recognition of
losses in the year incurred, subject to realization. The 
adoption of SFAS No. 109 resulted in a net benefit to
1992 earnings of $285 million, including a $420 mil-
lion benefit to 1992 first quarter earnings for the
cumulative effect of this accounting change and a 
charge of $135 million attributable to and included in 
1992 earnings.
  The special items included in the 1993, 1992 and
1991 results are detailed below. For further informa-
tion see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial State-
ments and the discussion above.


(a)  These amounts are shown after-tax.

  Occidental's estimated operating expenses in 1993
relating to compliance with environmental laws and
regulations governing ongoing operations were
approximately $110 million, compared with $117 mil-
lion in 1992 and $135 million in 1991. The 1993
amount included $71 million in the chemical division,
$34 million in the oil and gas division and $5 million 
in the natural gas transmission division. In addition, 
estimated capital expenditures for environmental com-
pliance were $83 million in 1993, compared with $80
million in both 1992 and 1991. The 1993 amount 
included $47 million in the oil and gas division, $32
million in the chemical division and $4 million in the
natural gas transmission division. Divisional operating 
and capital expenditures for environmental compli-
ance are expected to increase in the future.

FOREIGN INVESTMENTS    Portions of Occiden-
tal's oil and gas assets are located in countries outside
North America, some of which may be considered 
politically and economically unstable. These assets
and the related operations are subject to the risk of 
actions by governmental authorities and insurgent 
groups. Occidental attempts to conduct its financial
affairs so as to protect against such risks and would 
expect to receive compensation in the event of
nationalization. At December 31, 1993, the carrying 
value of Occidental's oil and gas assets in countries 
outside North America aggregated approximately
$1.38 billion, or approximately 8 percent of Occiden-
tal's total assets at that date. Of such assets, approxi-
mately $530 million was located in Latin America, 
and substantially all of the remainder were located in
the Middle East, West Africa, Russia and Pakistan.

1994 BUSINESS OUTLOOK    Economic growth
has been rather sluggish in recent years. During 1994,
the rate of growth is expected to increase moderately 
in the United States and Japan and is expected to 
improve in other industrial Organization for Eco-
nomic Cooperation and Development countries,
particularly if energy prices remain weak. The combi-
nation of continued economic growth and low energy 
prices should in turn boost consumption. The new 
GATT and NAFTA trade agreements also are expected 
to give a boost to the worldwide economy. On a 
global scale, health, environmental and safety issues
are expected to continue to grow in importance.

Oil & Natural Gas Industry     The interplay
between global politics, world oil supply and demand
and the pace of economic growth worldwide will
remain the key factors in determining future crude oil
prices. Crude oil production capacity will continue to
grow in 1994. Several major OPEC producing coun-
tries, particularly Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, are contin-
uing to boost production capacity. The anticipated 
lifting of the embargo on exports from Iraq was one


of the factors that contributed to the oil price collapse
in late 1993 and is expected to continue to influence 
oil prices. The additional capacity, which includes 
non-OPEC production from areas like Yemen and the 
British North Sea, is continuing to exert downward 
pressure on prices. The extent of that pressure in the
future depends in part upon the ability of OPEC to
maintain production discipline as capacity grows.
These factors could well be counterbalanced by
declines in Russian crude oil exports due to produc-
tion problems and the prospect that the resumption 
of Iraqi exports could be delayed indefinitely. It is
within this geopolitical framework that the NYMEX 
futures market has emerged as a powerful influence
on price as traders react instantaneously based upon 
their perceptions of changing market fundamentals 
and news about global political events.
  The sector of the oil and gas industry that has
attracted the most attention recently and reflects the
most optimistic projections is natural gas. Prices of
natural gas in the United States have moved up 
rapidly and consumption increased in 1993 to over 20
Tcf, the highest level since 1979. The outlook for con-
tinued increases in natural gas demand remains 
highly positive because it is a clean burning, relatively
abundant fuel, making it very attractive in this "age
of environment." It has long been used for residential 
heating and burned under industrial and utility boil-
ers. Now a concerted effort is being made to adapt it
as a transport fuel.
  The United States has large potential reserves of 
natural gas, but drilling activity has been severely 
depressed in recent years. Consequently, proved nat-
ural gas reserves and productive capacity have
declined. With higher prices, companies are resuming
exploration in natural gas-prone areas, and drilling 
activity has started to increase.
  In recent years, structural problems, such as 
government price controls, production and con-
sumption regulations and cumbersome contract
problems, impeded the gas industry's ability to
respond to rapidly changing competitive conditions
and price changes.
  However, the industry recently has made changes
to resolve these problems. Supply contract problems 
are being resolved. The industry is aggressively pursu-
ing its existing markets and expanding into new ones.
Government regulations are being reduced and/or 
eliminated. And of prime importance, natural gas
pricing has become much more flexible and respon-
sive to market changes.
  The anticipated increase in economic activity in
1994 will in turn translate into an increased need for
energy, including natural gas.  In addition to increased
demand for natural gas associated with growing eco-
nomic activity and much colder than normal winter
weather in early 1994, demand also is expected to 
grow due to environmental regulations associated


  At December 31, 1993, $987 million of commercial paper and other notes due in 1994 were classified as non-
current since it is management's intention to refinance this amount on a long-term basis, utilizing proceeds from
the sale of $3.00 cumulative CXY-indexed convertible preferred stock (see Note 17) and an available line of bank
credit with a maturity extending beyond 1994.
  At December 31, 1993, minimum principal payments on senior funded debt, including sinking fund require-
ments, subsequent to December 31, 1994 aggregated $5.896 billion, of which $198 million is due in 1995, $18
million in 1996, $753 million in 1997, $635 million in 1998, $633 million in 1999 and $3.659 billion thereafter.
Included in the 1997 amount of $753 million is approximately $430 million that Occidental intends to initially 
refinance under its bank line of credit that expires in 1997, but with agreement of the parties, may be extended
for a further two years. Unamortized discount is generally being amortized to interest expense on the effective 
interest method over the lives of the related issues.
  At December 31, 1993, under the most restrictive covenants of certain financing agreements, the capacity for
the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on, and for acquisitions of, Occidental's capital stock was
approximately $1.3 billion, assuming that such dividends, distributions and acquisitions were made without
incurring additional borrowings.
  At December 31, 1993, Occidental had available lines of committed bank credit of approximately $1.9 billion,
net of $689 million representing amounts utilized to support commercial paper borrowings. Bank fees on commit-
ted lines of credit ranged from 0.125 percent to 0.25 percent.


  Occidental has authorized 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $1.00 per share. In February
1993, Occidental issued 11,500,000 shares of $3.875 cumulative convertible preferred stock. The $3.875 preferred 
stock is redeemable after February 1998, in whole or in part, at the option of Occidental, at redemption prices
declining to $50 per share in and after the year 2003. The $3.875 preferred stock has a liquidation value of $50 per
share plus accumulated unpaid dividends and is convertible at the option of the holder into common stock of
Occidental at a conversion price of $22.76 per share, subject to adjustment in certain events. Dividends on the
$3.875 preferred stock at an annual rate of $3.875 per share are cumulative and are payable quarterly in arrears,
when and as declared by Occidental's Board of Directors. Holders of the $3.875 preferred stock have no voting
rights, except in certain circumstances; however, they are entitled to elect additional directors if the equivalent of
six quarterly dividends on the $3.875 preferred stock are accumulated and unpaid.
  In 1992, Occidental redeemed all of its outstanding $12.00 cumulative preferred stock. Occidental had
400,000 shares of $12.00 cumulative preferred stock outstanding throughout 1991 and up until redemption in 
September 1992, with a carrying value of $40 million.
  In 1986, pursuant to a stockholders' rights plan, a dividend of one stock purchase right (right) on each out-
standing share of Occidental's common stock was issued. Similar rights have been, and generally will be, issued in
respect of shares of common stock subsequently issued. Each right becomes exercisable, upon the occurrence of
certain events, for one one-hundredth of a share of Series A junior participating preferred stock, par value $1 per
share, at a purchase price of $80 or, under certain circumstances, common stock or other securities, cash or other
assets having a then current market price (as defined and subject to adjustment) equal to twice such purchase
price. The rights currently are not exercisable and will be exercisable only if a person or group either acquires ben-
eficial ownership of 20 percent or more of Occidental's common stock or commences a tender or exchange offer
that would result in ownership of 30 percent or more. The rights, which expire in October 1996, are redeemable
in whole, but not in part, at Occidental's option at any time for a price of $.05 per right.


Pfizer's Animal Health Group is moving toward 
what promises to be the most significant period
of growth in its history. The group is in the early
stages of introducing three major new products-~
Dectomax, Advocin and Aviax-~around the world.
These innovative products add significant thera-
peutic value to the practice of animal husbandry.
They, along with the technical assistance needed
to use them for best results, will be important addi-
tions to the line of products which the Animal
Health Group markets to the large producers of
food animals.
  Operationally, 1993 was an exciting year. We 
launched Dectomax in its first markets. Advocin
sales continued to expand, and sales of in-line
products maintained excellent levels. We also
began a number of restructuring projects which
we expect will contribute significantly to our
future profitability. A major element of our restruc-
turing was the formation of the North American 
Animal Health Division, a fully integrated opera-
tion serving the U.S. and Canada. By moving the
headquarters of this new division to Lee's Summit,
Missouri-~within 1,000 miles of all our major cus-
tomers-~we have made it possible for our senior 
management to work more closely with the largest 
food producers, while at the same time reducing
costs and improving efficiency.
  Beginning in 1994, the Animal Health Group 
expects to realize significant growth in both sales
and profit. New products should account for at
least 40 percent of worldwide sales by 1998. In 
addition, new drug candidates already in our dis-
covery research facilities hold the promise of a 
substantial pipeline of new products well into the
next century.


doing on the product. The early success of 
Dectomax in Brazil, the world's second-largest cat-
tle market, is a significant indicator of its potential.
  Sales of Advocin, our fluoroquinolone antibac-
terial for livestock, increased significantly in 1993
largely on the strength of its successful introduc-
tion in Japan. The product is now available 
throughout most of Latin America, Africa and 
Asia. By late 1995, we expect to begin rolling it out
in the large markets of Europe and the U.S., where
respiratory disease is a major problem.
  Aviax, a Pfizer-discovered product for the treat-
ment of coccidiosis in chickens, should be intro-
duced shortly. It has already been approved in 
most of Latin America. Aviax will complement
Coxistac, a licensed anticoccidial  which we mar-
ket outside the U.S. and Europe. Since poultry 
producers generally rotate their flocks between
three or four anticoccidials, it will enhance our
sales opportunities where we market Coxistac and
will open up a whole new business for Pfizer in 
those countries where we do not.
  In addition to introducing innovative new prod-
ucts developed by our researchers, the Animal
Health Group is working hard to improve the prof-
itability of its existing world markets and products.
Our flagship in-line product, TM/LA, continued to
show excellent growth-~particularly in the West-
ern Hemisphere, where sales increased by 29 per-
cent. Sales of our anthelmintic family of products
rose by 13 percent, and Coxistac sales increased by
9 percent. The 9 percent decline in operating profit
reflects the initial manufacturing start-up expenses
for several new products as well as heavy expendi-
tures to support new product introductions.


pending in the Superior Court, Orange County,
California.  More than 100 of these were settled in early
1993.  Trial of the first of the remaining cases, of six
selected for trial, began July 29, 1993.  After trial, but
before verdict, most of the remaining cases as well as
several unfiled claims, involving approximately 250
implantees, were settled.
  In an attempt to resolve all claims alleging anxiety that
properly functioning valves might fracture in the future,
the Company entered into a settlement agreement in
January 1992 in Bowling v. Shiley et al., a case brought in
the United States District Court for the Southern District
of Ohio that establishes a worldwide settlement class
of people with C/C heart valves and their spouses, except
those who elect to exclude themselves.  The settlement
provides for a Consultation Fund of $90 to $140 million
(depending on the number of claims filed) from which
valve recipients who make claims will receive payments
that are intended to cover their cost of consultation with
cardiologists or other health care providers with respect
to their valves.  The settlement agreement establishes a
second fund of at least $75 million to support C/C valve-
related research, including the development of tech-
niques to identify valve recipients who may have
significant risk of fracture, and to cover the unreim-
bursed medical expenses that valve recipients may incur
for certain procedures related to the valves. The
Company's obligation as to coverage of these unreim-
bursed medical expenses is not subject to any dollar
limitation.  Following a hearing on the fairness of the
settlement, it was approved by the court on August 19,
1992.  An appeal of the court's approval of the settlement
was dismissed on December 20, 1993 by the United
States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.  A motion
for rehearing en banc is currently pending.  It is expected
that most of the costs arising from the Bowling class set-
tlement will be covered by insurance and the proceeds
of the sale of certain product lines of the Shiley busi-
nesses in 1992.
  Of approximately 900 implantees (and spouses of some
of them) who opted out of the Bowling settlement class,
12 currently have cases or claims pending in the Kahn
consolidation in California; 4 have cases or claims pend-
ing outside of California; approximately 675 whose claims
were included in the Kahn consolidation have been set-
tled; approximately 100 have never filed a case or claim;
and approximately 10 have working valve cases pending.
  Several claims relating to elective reoperations of valve
recipients are currently pending.  Some of these claims
relate to elective reoperations covered by the Bowling
class settlement described above, and, therefore, the
claimants are entitled to certain benefits in accordance
with the settlement.  Such claimants, if they irrevocably
waive all of the benefits of the settlement, may pursue
separate litigation to recover damages in spite of the class
settlement.  The Company is defending these claims.
  Generally, the plaintiffs in all of the pending heart
valve litigations discussed above seek money damages.


Based on the experience of the Company in defending
these claims to date, including available insurance and
reserves, the Company is of the opinion that these actions
should not have a material adverse effect on the financial
position or the results of operations of the Company.
  On September 30, 1993, Dairyland Insurance Co.,
a carrier providing excess liability coverage ("excess car-
rier") in the early 1980s, commenced an action in the
California Superior Court in Orange County, seeking
a declaratory judgment that it was not obligated to pro-
vide insurance coverage for Shiley heart valve liability
claims.  On October 8, 1993, Pfizer filed cross-complaints
against Dairyland and filed third-party complaints
against 73 other excess carriers who sold excess liability
policies covering periods from 1978 to 1985, seeking
damages and declaratory judgments that they are oblig-
ated to pay for defense and indemnity to the extent not
paid by other carriers.
  The Company's operations are subject to federal, state
and local environmental laws and regulations.  Under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation
and Liability Act of 1980, as amended ("CERCLA"
or "Superfund"), the Company has been designated as
a potentially responsible party by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency with respect to certain
waste sites with which the Company may have had direct
or indirect involvement.  Similar designations have been
made by some state environmental agencies under
applicable state superfund laws.  Such designations are
made regardless of the extent of the Company's involve-
ment.  There are also claims that the Company is a
potentially responsible party or participant with respect
to several waste sites in Canada.  Such claims have been
made by the filing of a complaint, the issuance of an
administrative directive or order, or the issuance of a
notice or demand letter.  These claims are in various
stages of administrative or judicial proceedings.  They
include demands for recovery of past governmental costs
and for future investigative or remedial actions.  In many
cases, the dollar amount of the claim is not specified.
In most cases, claims have been asserted against a num-
ber of other entities for the same recovery or other relief
as was asserted against the Company.  The Company is
currently participating in remedial action at a number
of sites under federal, state and local laws.
  To the extent possible with the limited amount of
information available at this time, the Company has evalu-
ated its responsibility for costs and related liability with
respect to the above sites and is of the opinion that the
Company's liability with respect to these sites should not
have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or
the results of operations of the Company.  In arriving at this
conclusion, the Company has considered, among other
things, the payments that have been made with respect to
the sites in the past; the factors, such as volume and rela-
tive toxicity, ordinarily applied to allocate defense and
remedial costs at such sites; the probable costs to be paid
by the other potentially responsible parties; total projected


Ralston Purina
Group Results

For the year, RPG Group's pro forma
sales and net earnings before restructur-
ing charges were $5,236,200,000 and
$266,400,000, respectively, compared
to $5,024,300,000 and $277,300,000
in 1993.  Pro forma earnings per share for
the year were $2.48 and $2.37 on a pri-
mary and fully diluted basis, respectively,
compared to $2.50 and $2.38.  The
decrease in pro forma results was driven
by a $.25 per primary share decrease
in earnings related to the RPG Group's
retained interest in the CBG Group,
partially offset by higher operating
earnings.

Operating profit for domestic pet foods
was flat as higher volumes were offset by
higher ingredient costs.  Operating profit
for international pet foods improved on
higher volumes.

Battery Products' operating profit, exclu-
sive of restructuring charges, increased
for the year on significantly higher
domestic results and inclusion of
rechargeable operations acquired in
August 1993, partially offset by contin-
ued declines in Europe.  Domestic
increases were driven by improved alka-
line volume.  European operations
declined on an unfavorable product
mix, significant declines in carbon zinc
volume and increased costs associated
with launching of the Energizer brand to
supplant existing alkaline brands.
Unadjusted operating profit for Battery
Products was down due to charges
related to restructuring of the worldwide
carbon zinc operations.

Operating profit for the Protein business
improved on increased volumes partially
offset by higher raw materials costs and
unfavorable foreign currency exchange
rates.  International Agricultural Products
profit was down slightly due to volume
declines in Europe, partially offset by
improvements in Asia and the Americas.

COMPANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS


We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of
Raytheon Company and Subsidiaries Consolidated as of Dec.
31, 1993 and 1992, and the related statements of income,
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended Dec. 31, 1993. These financial state-
ments are the responsibility of the company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
  We conducted our audits in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assur-
ance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing 
the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall


vendor that went into one of ConvaTec's 
DuoDERM adhesive wound dressings.
But when the team was set up in 
late 1993, it was headed instead by
Sandra Thomas-~an operator on the
bandage line. "We applied what we
had learned in the company's Total
Quality Leadership (TQL) program,"
says Ms. Thomas, one of four opera-
tors in the group. "We gathered data
to prove the problem. Then we 
worked with the vendor to fix it."
Giving greater responsibility to 
people like Ms. Thomas is one way
the TQL program seeks continuous 
gains in quality and customer satis-
faction. "TQL reinforces values
ConvaTec already had," says Joe
Solari, ConvaTec president. "We 
are known as a caring and dynamic
place, and we attract people who
want to be part of that."


"Changes like this help us serve key institutional 
customers, such as large health plans, hospital pur-
chasing consortia and university medical systems,"
explains Steve Greco, the regional director for
California. "Now we align ourselves as partners with
our customers. We try to find the best drugs for
them, whether that means a name brand like Pravachol
or a multi-sourced medication from Apothecon, the
company's generics division." While the overall size 
of the sales force fell from 2,250 to 1,500, other
operations grew larger-~including those that serve 
managed care plans and hospital and institutional
sales. And the company maintained its existing sales
forces in fields like oncology, which demand special-
ization. "We focus on the customer as never before,"


The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.

At December 31, 1994, 33,428,296 shares of common stock were
reserved for issuance pursuant to stock plans, options and conver-
sions of preferred stock.

Attached to each outstanding share of the company's common 
stock is one Right. The Rights will be exercisable if a person
or group acquires beneficial interest of 15% or more of the com-
pany's outstanding common stock, or commences a tender or
exchange offer for 15% or more of the company's outstanding
common stock. Each Right will entitle stockholders to buy one 
one-thousandth of a share of a new series of participating pre-
ferred stock of the company at an exercise price of $200. The
Rights will expire on December 18, 1997. In the event of certain
merger, sale of assets or self-dealing transactions, each Right will
then entitle its holder to acquire shares having a value of twice
the Right's exercise price. The company may redeem the Rights 
at $.01 per Right at any time until the 15th day following public 
announcement that a 15% position has been acquired.

NOTE 16 LEASES

Minimum rental commitments under all noncancelable operating
leases, primarily real estate, in effect at December 31, 1994 were:


NOTE 17 SEGMENT INFORMATION

The company's products are reported in four industry segments
as follows:

Pharmaceutical Products-~includes prescription medicines,
mainly cardiovascular, anti-infective and anti-cancer drugs,
which comprise about 40%, 25% and 20%, respectively, of the
segment's sales, central nervous system drugs and other pharma-
ceutical products.

Medical Devices-~includes orthopaedic implants, which comprise
about 40% of the segment's sales, ostomy and wound care products
surgical instruments and other medical devices.

Nonprescription Health Products-~includes infant formulas and
other nutritional products, which comprise about 65% of the seg-
ment's sales, analgesics, cough/cold remedies and skin care products.

Toiletries and Beauty Aids-~includes haircoloring and hair care 
preparations, which comprise about 75% of the segment's sales in 
1994 and 65% in both 1993 and 1992, and deodorants, anti-per-
spirants and other toiletries and beauty aids.

Unallocated expenses principally consist of general administrative 
expenses and net interest income, and in 1992 include a portion 
of the charge for restructuring. Other assets are principally cash
and cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities.
Inter-area sales by geographic area for the years ended December
31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively, were: United States-~
$867 million, $859 million and $915 million; Europe, Mid-East
and Africa-~$428 million, $504 million and $382 million; Other
Western Hemisphere-~$37 million, $41 million and $36 million;
and Pacific-~$28 million, $43 million and $26 million. These 
sales are usually billed at or above manufacturing costs.

Net assets relating to operations outside the United States
amounted to $2,286 million, $1,511 million and $1,369 million
at December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.


  Our government avionics business 
won an initial $11 million U.S. Army
contract for ARC-220 high frequency 
radios with production options that
would expand total contract value
to $150 million. The ARC-220s will
go into approximately 3,000 Army
helicopters.
  Production orders totaling $47
million for approximately 27,000 
Precision Lightweight GPS Receivers
(PLGR) were received from the U.S. 
Department of Defense (DoD) and
international customers. During the


year we delivered the 20,000th PLGR 
produced under the DoD contract. U.S. 
production alone could total nearly 
94,000 units if all options are exercised.
  Other awards include a $44 
million DoD contract for production of 
ARC-210 Army/Navy/Marine radios, a 
$21 million pact to upgrade avionics 
on German C-160 cargo aircraft, a $17 
million contract for transceivers for
Gulfstream IV/V aircraft, and a $16 mil-
lion contract to upgrade avionics on 
Canadian C-130 aircraft.


Our Telecommunications business had 
record sales and earnings in fiscal 1994,
a performance driven by continued 
strong demand for high-speed data
modems. This business supplies 
facsimile and data modems and other
advanced semiconductor devices to 
process, transmit and receive all types
of information. We provide approxi-
mately 80 percent of all facsimile
modems and 60 percent of personal
computer data modems worldwide.


  The year was highlighted by
major investments in expansion of
facilities and new product introduction.
  An $150 million expansion of our
Newport Beach, California facility,
primarily for volume manufacture of 
eight-inch submicron wafers, neared
completion at year-end. Eight-inch 
wafers represent the current state-of-
the-art for volume production of 
silicon-based semiconductor devices.
  In 1994, we executed an agree-


ment to acquire additional eight-inch
wafer capacity through a minority
equity investment in Chartered 
Semiconductor Manufacturing Pte.
Ltd., Singapore.
  We continued development of 
products to meet the information pro-
cessing needs of the future.
  In February, 1994, faced with 
delay in establishment of an industry
standard for faster communications
devices, we introduced our V.Fast Class
data/fax modem which served as a 
"bridging" product until a new modem
standard was ratified. Operating at
28,800 bits-per-second, twice as fast as

1. Financial Statement Presentation

Significant accounting policies are set forth in italics as an
integral part of the notes to financial statements to which 
the policies relate. Certain prior year amounts have been
reclassified to conform with current year presentation.
  In 1992, the company adopted Financial Accounting 
Standards Board Statement No. 106, "Employers' Accounting 
for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," resulting
in a one-time charge to earnings of $1,519 million, or $6.78
per share, after a deferred tax benefit of $931 million. The 
company also adopted Statement No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes," which did not have a material effect on 1992
income before change in accounting.

2. Acquisition of Reliance Electric Company

On November 21, 1994, the company announced it had 
entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all shares of
common stock of Reliance Electric Company (Reliance), a 
major manufacturer of industrial products and telecommuni-
cations equipment with annual sales of $1.7 billion, at a 
price of $31 per share of Class A and Class B common stock
and an equivalent price ($83.95) for Class C common stock.
The offer has a total transaction value of approximately $1.6
billion and is expected to be completed in early 1995. The
company will finance this acquisition utilizing its credit
agreements (see Note 8). The company has announced its 
intention to divest Reliance's telecommunications business
which has annual sales of approximately $440 million.

3. Receivables

Receivables are summarized as follows (in millions):


  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (using LIFO, FIFO or
average methods) or market (determined on the basis of estimated 
realizable values), less related progress payments received. Pursuant
to contract provisions the United States Government has
title to, or a security interest in, certain inventories as a
result of progress payments.
  Long-term contracts in process consist of inventoried 
costs principally relating to fixed-price-type contracts with
the United States Government. Such inventoried costs include
direct costs of manufacturing, engineering and tooling, and allocable
overhead costs including general and administrative expenses allowable
in accordance with United States Government contract cost principles.
In accordance with industry practice, such inventoried costs include
amounts which are not expected to be realized within one year.

11. Short-Term Borrowings and Lines of Credit


The Company had $500 million of credit facilities as of
December 31, 1993 in the form of revolving credit agree-
ments from commercial banks which provide for revolv-
ing credit through August 1996. These facilities support
Sun's commercial paper borrowings. All of the above 
facilities are subject to commitment fees, the amounts of
which are not material. As of December 31, 1993, there
were no borrowings against these revolving credit agree-
ments. The Company also has access to short-term financ-
ing under non-committed money market facilities. At
December 31, 1993, $60 million was borrowed through 
these facilities.

At December 31, 1993, Suncor had a revolving term
credit facility available for its own use aggregating ap-
proximately $302 million. Committed revolving credit
will be available through October 1998. The facility pro-
vides for commitment fees, the amounts of which are not
material. At December 31, 1993, $91 million was bor-
rowed against this facility which was classified as long-
term debt as it is Suncor's intention to refinance that
amount on a long-term basis (Note 12).


*Net of debentures held in treasury.

  While settlement of the terminated portions of the
FSD contract has not been finalized with the U.S. Gov-
ernment, Textron believes that its share of cumulative 
losses on the FSD contract is not likely to exceed the 
amounts previously recorded.

1992 vs. 1991

The Aircraft segment's revenues and income increased in 
1992 by $265.3 million (21%) and $15.3 million
(14%), respectively, due to the inclusion of the operat-
ing results of Cessna's manufacturing operations for 10
months in 1992, partially offset by lower revenues and
income at Bell Helicopter.
  Bell Helicopter's revenues decreased significantly in 
its non-U.S. Government business due to market soft-
ness and decreased to a lesser degree in its U.S. Govern-
ment business. Bell's income decreased primarily as a
result of the lower revenues, the effect in 1991 of a 
favorable LIFO inventory reserve adjustment (resulting
from a reduction in LIFO inventories) and the effect of 
the new accounting method relative to postretirement 
benefits other than pensions, partially offset by the ben-
efit of a lower provision in 1992 ($10 million vs. $45 
million in 1991) for cost increases on the V-22 FSD 
contract and other loss provisions in 1991.

Automotive 
1993 vs. 1992

The Automotive segment's revenues increased $389.1 
million (50%) in 1993 primarily as a result of the inclu-
sion of the operating results of Textron Acustar Plastics
for eight months, higher automotive production and a 
broader market penetration of automotive interior prod-
ucts. Income increased $22.1 million (34%), due to the
higher revenues, partially offset by a special warranty
provision and provisions for restructuring costs of $7
million.

1992 vs. 1991

The Automotive segment's revenues increased $110.3 
million (16%) over the 1991 level primarily as a result
of broader market penetration of automotive interior
products. Income increased $15.6 million (31%), due to 
the higher revenues, partially offset by higher start-up
costs on new programs and plants.

Report of Management


The consolidated financial statements of Textron Inc.
have been prepared by management and have been 
audited by Textron's independent auditors, Ernst &
Young, whose report appears below. Management is
responsible for the consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles and include amounts 
based on management's judgments.
  Management is also responsible for maintaining 
internal accounting control systems designed to provide
reasonable assurance, at appropriate cost, that assets are
safeguarded and that transactions are executed and 
recorded in accordance with established policies and
procedures. Textron's systems are under continuing 
review and are supported by, among other things, busi-
ness conduct and other written guidelines, an internal
audit function and the selection and training of qualified 
personnel.


Report of Independent Auditors


We have audited the accompanying consolidated bal-
ance sheet of Textron Inc. as of January 1, 1994 and
January 2, 1993, and the related consolidated state-
ments of income, cash flows and changes in shareholders'
equity for each of the three years in the period ended 
January 1, 1994. These financial statements are the 
responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
  We conducted our audits in accordance with gener-
ally accepted auditing standards. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial state-
ments are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting princi-
ples used and significant estimates made by manage-
ment, as well as evaluating the overall financial state-
ment presentation. We believe that our audits provide a 
reasonable basis for our opinion.


  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to 
above present fairly, in all material respects, the consoli-
dated financial position of Textron Inc. at January 1,
1994 and January 2, 1993 and the consolidated results
of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three 
years in the period ended January 1, 1994 in conformity 
with generally accepted accounting principles.
  As discussed in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated
financial statements, in fiscal 1992 the Company 
changed its methods of accounting for postretirement
benefits other than pensions and income taxes.


(A) 1993 and 1992 amounts include cumulative effect of accounting changes.

growing number of our software solutions, these 
systems are based on flexible client/server archi-
tectures designed for easy integration with other 
vendors' systems.
  To ensure we deliver truly value-added solu-
tions, we involve our clients throughout the devel-
opment process. We built FBA Navigator and FBA 
BANKview, for instance, in consultation with key 
banking partners. LifeLine reflects the input of
police chiefs and dispatchers.
  Alliances with outside industry partners are
also key to our approach. Through our alliance 
with KPMG Peat Marwick, for instance, we offer
our clients a broad base of industry expertise as
well as specific software solutions for financial
management, human resources, and process man-
ufacturing. An alliance with software provider


Information Technology, Inc., which provides a leading banking package running on our A Series systems, has
helped us win new banking, savings and loan, and credit union clients.
  In our services engagements, and in our solutions, we are making increasing use of the skills and underlying
technologies of our Government Systems Group. Joint government and commercial teams are evaluating commer-
cial projects in such potential growth areas as airport automation and fingerprint imaging. In another area, we are
working with Time Warner to evaluate applying our spread spectrum technology -~ originally used to ensure the
secure communication of information for military purposes -~ to improve the security and capability of tomorrow's
cable television networks.
  In 1994 we will continue an active expansion of our information services program. We look to build our repu-
tation as a world-class provider of information services, and continue our strong growth in this dynamic market.

Department of National Defence. Any future declines in defense industry spending could affect the 
Company's ability to obtain new defense contracts, and no assurance can be given that current, in-
process, multiple-year contracts will not be downsized or discontinued.
  Total gross profit margin increased to 37% in 1993 from 36% in 1992. Sales gross profit margin in 1993
was 41% compared to 38% in 1992; services gross profit margin for 1993 was 23% compared to 21% in 1992;
and equipment maintenance gross profit margin for 1993 was 43% compared to 42% in 1992. Excluding 
restructuring charges, in 1991 the total gross profit margin was 32%, sales gross profit margin was 33%,
services gross profit margin was 17%, and equipment maintenance gross profit margin was 40%. Prior
years' services gross profit margin reflects a reclassification of certain selling, general and administrative
expenses to cost of services to conform with the 1993 presentation of such costs. This reclassification was
made to better match service costs with service revenue and produced no change to operating profit.


  Selling, general and administrative expenses for 1993 was $1.6 billion, a decrease of 7% from $1.8 billion in 1992. The decline 
was principally due to the effects of continued tight cost management and foreign currency translation. Selling, general and
administrative expenses for 1992 were $1.8 billion compared to $2.3 billion in 1991. Exclusive of restructuring charges in 1991,
selling, general and administrative expenses declined 10%. The decline was principally due to the Company's repositioning
actions. Total employment at December 31, 1993 was approximately 49,000 compared to approximately 54,300 at December 31, 
1992 and 60,300 at December 31, 1991.

  Research and development expenses in 1993 were $515.2 million compared to $535.9 million in 1992, a decline of 4%.
Research and development expenses in 1992 were $535.9 million compared to $638.9 million in 1991. Exclusive of special charges
in 1991, research and development expenses declined 9% in 1992 from 1991. The decline in all periods resulted from repositioning
actions which reduced managerial and administrative costs and focused research and development efforts on core products.


  As a result of the above, operating income was $734.1 million in 1993 (9.5% of revenue) com-
pared to $720.7 million in 1992 (8.6% of revenue) and an operating loss of $578.9 million in 1991
($245.3 million operating income exclusive of special charges, 2.8% of revenue).
  Interest expense was $241.7 million in 1993, down from $340.6 million in 1992, reflecting prin-
cipally lower average debt levels. Interest expense in 1992 was down from $407.6 million in 1991, 
reflecting both lower average debt levels and lower average interest rates.
  Other income in 1993 was $11.0 million compared to $55.5 million in 1992 and an expense of 
$301.8 million in 1991. Excluding special charges of $375.4 million, 1991 other income was $73.6 
million. Included in 1993 is a charge of $20.0 million related to the "Ill Wind" settlement. This set-
tlement requires the Company to make contingency payments based on proceeds from asset sales
and on net income. The maximum contingent amount payable in 1994 under this settlement agree-
ment is $30.0 million.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Unisys Corporation

1. Summary of significant accounting policies

Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all
wholly owned subsidiaries. Investments in companies representing
ownership interests of 20% to 50% are accounted for by the equity
method.

Cash equivalents
All short-term investments purchased with a maturity of three
months or less are classified as cash equivalents.

Marketable securities 
Marketable securities, consisting principally of U.S. Government 
securities, are carried at cost plus accrued interest, which approxi-
mates market.

Inventories 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is deter-
mined principally on the first-in, first-out method.

Properties, rental equipment and depreciation
Properties and rental equipment are carried at cost and are depreci-
ated over the estimated lives of such assets using the straight-line
method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of
the asset lives or the terms of the respective leases. The principal
rates used are summarized below by classification of properties:


Revenue under cost-type contracts is recognized when costs are
incurred, and under fixed-price contracts when products or services
are accepted and billings can be made. General and administrative 
expenses are charged to income as incurred. Cost of revenue under
long-term contracts is charged based on current estimated total 
costs. When estimates indicate a loss under a contract, cost of rev-
enue is charged with a provision for such loss.

Income taxes
Income taxes are provided on taxable income at the statutory rates
applicable to such income. Deferred taxes have not been provided 
on the cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries
since such amounts are expected to be reinvested indefinitely.

Earnings per common share
In 1993 and 1992, the computation of primary earnings per share was
based on the weighted average number of outstanding common
shares and additional shares assuming the exercise of stock options.
The computation of fully diluted earnings per share for both years
further assumes the conversion of the 8~~~% convertible subordinated 
notes due August 1, 2000. The computation of fully diluted earnings
per share for 1993 further assumes conversion of Series A Cumu-
lative Convertible Preferred Stock. In 1991, both primary and fully
diluted earnings per common share were based on the weighted 
average number of outstanding common shares. The inclusion of
additional shares assuming the conversion of Series A Cumulative
Convertible Preferred Stock would have been antidilutive in 1992
and 1991. The shares used in the computations for the three years 
ended December 31, 1993 were as follows (in thousands):

UTC is established in all but


six of the world's countries, giving it a 


global reach unique among U.S. companies.
Otis, Carrier, UT Automotive, Pratt &
Whitney, Sikorsky and Hamilton Standard,
on the strength of new ideas, are developing
business in every growing market, emerging
and established, where technology and 
industry leading products are in demand.

The pages that follow illustrate UTC's 
activities in a changing world, market by 
market, and actions to grow revenues in 
the years ahead.
 

Segment Review
1994 Compared to 1993

Otis segment revenues for 1994 increased $226 million (5%)
over 1993. Increased revenues in Asia Pacific and North America
were partially offset by slightly lower revenues in Europe and Latin
America. Revenue increases in Asia Pacific were particularly signifi-
cant during 1994, in part from the increased investment made in 
the People's Republic of China earlier in the year which allowed for
full consolidation. While lower new equipment volumes negatively
affected revenues in Europe and Latin America, the reduction was 
partially offset by higher service revenues. The impact of the transla-
tion of foreign currency revenues into U.S. dollars was a negative 
$19 million for 1994.
  Segment operating profits for Otis in 1994 increased $44 million 
(12%), improving in all regions with the exception of Latin Amer-
ica. Increases in Asia Pacific resulted primarily from the consolida-
tion of the PRC operations and the growth of the Asian market.
European results improved due to the higher service volumes.

Carrier segment revenues for 1994 increased $439 million (10%)
over 1993. Revenues were higher at Carrier Transicold and in all
geographic regions except Europe where volumes were lower. Rev-
enue increases were particularly strong in North America reflecting
the impact of significant volume increases. The impact of the
translation of foreign currency revenues into U.S. dollars was not
significant during 1994.
  Carrier segment operating profits for 1994 increased $52 million
(23%) primarily due to improved results in North America and at
Carrier's Transicold business. Operations in the People's Republic of
China also showed continued strength and accounted for approxi-
mately 15% of Carrier's operating profits over the last three years.

Automotive segment revenues increased $305 million (13%) in 
1994 primarily due to higher North American industry volumes 
and increased European market penetration.
  Automotive segment operating profits for 1994 increased $34
million (23%) over 1993. The increase is primarily attributable to
higher sales volumes and the absence of the 1993 charges to
rationalize certain manufacturing operations in Europe. Partially

1993 Compared to 1992

Otis segment revenues decreased $94 million (2%) in 1993. The
impact of currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar reduced 
revenues by approximately $278 million (6%) in 1993. Revenues 
in 1993, exclusive of the translation impact, increased due to higher
service volumes in all regions. In addition, new equipment revenues
were slightly higher in 1993 primarily due to higher volumes in the
European and Latin American regions partially offset by lower 
North American volume.
  Otis segment operating profits increased $31 million (9%) in 
1993. The translation impact of the stronger U.S. dollar negatively
impacted operating profits by $38 million. The improved operating
profits reflect the growth in service volumes during 1993. During 
1993, increases in Latin American and European new equipment 
volumes and improvement in Latin American new equipment mar-
gins also contributed to the growth.

Carrier segment revenues increased $152 million (4%) in 1993. 
The translation of a stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted 1993
revenues by approximately $115 million (3%). 1993 revenues 
reflect volume increases in the North American, Asia Pacific and
Latin American regions as well as the transportation refrigeration
business. These increases were partially offset by the effects of the
continuing recession in Europe, particularly affecting the Spanish
and Italian operations.
  Carrier segment operating profits increased $43 million (23%)
in 1993. Improved operating profits resulting from increased vol-
umes and margins in the Asia Pacific and Latin American regions 
were partially offset by the effects of the continuing recession in
Europe.

Automotive segment revenues were essentially unchanged
from 1992. During 1993 the segment was positively impacted by
increased North American car and light truck production and
European market penetration. These increases were substantially 
offset by the overall reduction in European vehicle production, the
negative translation impact of the stronger U.S. dollar of approxi-
mately $112 million (5%), and the absence of sales in 1993 from
certain automotive business units divested in the third quarter of
1992.
  Automotive segment operating profits increased $13 million 
(10%) in 1993. Operating profits during 1993 reflect the impact of
increased North American production volumes and European mar-
ket penetration. During 1993, these increases were partially offset
by the reduction in European vehicle production, charges to ratio-
nalize certain manufacturing operations in Europe and the absence

U.S. Government

The Corporation is now and believes that, in light of the current 
government contracting environment, it will be the subject of one
or more government investigations. If the Corporation or one of its
business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any of 
these investigations, the Corporation or one of its business units
could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new
government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings.
If convicted or found liable, the Corporation could be fined and
debarred from new government contracting for a period generally
not to exceed three years. Any contracts found to be tainted by
fraud could be voided by the Government.
  The Corporation's contracts with the U.S. Government are also
subject to audits. Like many defense contractors, the Corporation
has received audit reports which recommend that certain contract
prices should be reduced to comply with various government regu-
lations. Some of these audit reports involve substantial amounts.
The Corporation has made voluntary refunds in those cases it
believes appropriate.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Corporation uses derivative financial instruments to
manage foreign currency and interest rate exposures in the follow-
ing four areas: foreign currency transactions, foreign net assets,
customer financing assets, and debt. Derivative financial instru-
ments utilized by the Corporation in its foreign currency and
interest rate hedging activities are Over The Counter instruments
and involve little complexity. The Corporation has policies
to monitor the concentration and credit risks of counterparties,
which are a diversified group of major investment grade financial 
institutions.
  International operations, including export sales, constitute a sig-
nificant portion of the revenues and identifiable assets of the Cor-
poration, averaging approximately $11.8 billion and $4.6 billion,
respectively, for each of the last three years. These operations result
in a large volume of foreign currency commitment and transaction
exposures and significant foreign currency net asset exposures. For-
eign currency commitment and transaction exposures are managed
at the operating unit level as an integral part of the business. To the
extent that foreign currency exposures cannot be offset or managed 
to an insignificant amount, it is the Corporation's policy to hedge 
these residual foreign currency commitment and transaction expo-
sures. These hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the


timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and trans-
actions. It has been the Corporation's policy to hedge a portion of
the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates associ-
ated with these foreign investments. During 1994 the Corporation
substantially changed this policy and generally will not hedge for-
eign net asset exposures. Certain hedge contracts from the prior 
policy are still outstanding and may be held until their scheduled
maturity.
  The Corporation also has financing assets with commercial air-
line industry customers in connection with engine sale agreements. 
The Corporation may sell customer financing assets from time to 
time based on current market conditions and other factors. To miti-
gate the exposure on certain fixed rate customer financing assets, the
Corporation has entered into interest rate swaps.
  It has been the Corporation's practice to manage the relative
proportions of its fixed rate and floating rate debt in the context of
the interest rate environment, expected cash flow and anticipated 
debt retirements. While the hedging strategies on both debt and 
customer financing assets are an integral portion of the Corpora-
tion's risk management, the impact on earnings during the periods
were not material.
Cash Flow -~ Key to Growth


In 1993, Unocal began to implement a ten-year plan for growth with
a strategy firmly focused on our basic businesses and core competi-
tive strengths. Our goals are aggressive, but our strategy is flexible
enough to allow us to respond quickly to changing energy markets
and emerging investment opportunities.
  Cash flow from operations is the key to growth. We'll strengthen
cash flow over the next decade primarily by increasing energy re-
source production. We'll also emphasize cost control and continu-
ous improvement in all of our activities.
  For the next three years, most production increases will come
from our accelerated North American development program, which 
is centered on the Gulf of Mexico. This program, launched in 1993, 
began to show results by year end. Lower-than-expected oil prices 
at the beginning of 1994 caused us to shift our development em-
phasis toward natural gas, where prices remain strong. This shift 
and reduction in capital spending, if extended over most of the year, 
may delay achievement of our production goals later in the decade.
  Over the longer term, our growth strategy is based on expanding 
our extensive oil, gas and geothermal operations in Southeast Asia.
We expect to help develop the energy resource potential in the 
Greater Middle East, including the Caspian Sea, and other areas of 
the world where our skills and technologies provide a competitive
edge. We will continue to forge strategic alliances and partnerships
to become more competitive in the global energy economy.


Key Drivers of Cash Flow Growth


averaged 23 million cubic feet of natural gas in Janu-
ary and is expected to increase above 30 million cubic
feet by April 1994. Unocal's interest is 100 percent.
  Nearby Mobile Block 861, brought on stream in 
February 1994, could add 30 million cubic feet per 
day. The company holds a 25 percent interest. Ver-
milion block 328 (50 percent interest), also brought
on stream in February, is expected to produce 24 
million cubic feet per day by June 1994.
  Offshore Louisiana, Unocal has a 50 percent in-
terest in Garden Banks 191, on stream since Novem-
ber 1993 and expected to produce 160 million 
cubic feet of gas per day by October 1994. Unocal 
also holds a 50 percent interest in Garden Banks
189, which achieved peak gas production of 69 mil-
lion cubic feet per day in January 1994.
  Onshore, Unocal logged new gas reserves in 
Fresh Water Bayou in Louisiana in January 1994.
These reserves are in the same deep zone that has 
dramatically boosted gas production in the North 
Fresh Water Bayou field -~ from 4 million cubic 
feet per day in 1985 to 80 million cubic feet per day
in the last quarter of 1993.
  Unocal discovered gas at Felicia Creek in Liberty
County, Texas, in January 1993 and brought a sec-
ond well on stream in December. The field's daily


Investment securities and long-term debt are valued at
quoted market prices for similar instruments.  The fair
values of the remaining financial instruments in the
above table are based on dealer quotes and reflect the
estimated amounts that the company would pay or
receive to terminate the contracts. The carrying values
of all other financial instruments in the consolidated bal-
ance sheets approximate fair values.

The company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities," effective January 1, 1994. Adoption of SFAS
No. 115 had no impact on earnings since all nonequity
securities are categorized as "held-to-maturity" and,
accordingly, continue to be carried at amortized cost.  At
December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively, gross unreal-
ized gains were $.4 and $4.3. Gross unrealized losses
were $4.0 at December 31, 1994.  The investment securi-
ties portfolio was comprised of negotiable certificates of
deposit, Puerto Rico government bonds, guaranteed collat-
eralized mortgage obligations and Ginnie Mae certificates,
repurchase agreements and short-term U.S. dollar-linked
Mexican government bonds. Equity securities, catego-
rized as "available-for-sale," were immaterial.

The investment securities (mentioned above) were report-
ed in the following balance sheet categories:
