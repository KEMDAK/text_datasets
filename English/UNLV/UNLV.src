rine limit (Fig. 2-2) show a distinct pattern of
calving-bay propagation into northern Lauren-
tide ice.This pattern in itself is a strong indicator
that the maximum reconstruction in Figure 2-2
is more nearly correct than the minimum. The
sea penetrated northwestern ice-stream channels
in M'Clure Strait and Amundsen Gulf by 12,600
BP, at least 3000 yr prior to penetration of the
eastern ice-stream channel in Lancaster Sound.
In fact, the Amundsen Gulf ice stream had re-
ceded by 10,215 BP to Coronation Gulf, where
a bottleneck checked calving-bay propagation;
also, the M'Clure Strait ice stream lay against the
Winter Harbor moraine between about 11,000
and 10,000 BP, without concurrent recession of
the Lancaster Sound ice stream in the east. Rapid
breakup of northern Laurentide ice commenced
after 10,000 BP with the withdrawal of ice from
the Winter Harbor moraine. A calving bay had
propagated eastward into Viscount Melville
Sound by 9800 BP and into Barrow Strait north
of Prince of Wales and Somerset Islands by 9380
BP. Westward propagation of a calving bay into
Lancaster Sound was underway by 9280 BP. Sub-
sequently, coastal Somerset and Prince of Wales
Islands, as well as northern Boothia Peninsula,
were largely cleared of ice by 9200 BP, and the
southern Gulf of Boothia was cleared by 8870
BP. Thus, the northern sector of the Laurentide
Ice Sheet was dissected by calving bays that
propagated inland to the upper marine limit. By
8160 BP, the northern ice-sheet margin, no
longer being dissected by calving bays, lay
against the MacAlpine moraine system (Blake,
1966), which partly outlines the residual Kee-
watin dome, and against moraines on Melville
Peninsula (Craig, 1965a), which may possibly
mark the western margin of a residual dome in
Foxe Basin. Recession from these moraine sys-
tems and final ice-sheet disintegration are dis-
cussed with the history of the interior of the Lau-
rentide Ice Sheet.
Northeastern Sector
Late Wisconsin Maximum. The northeastern
margin of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, particularly
in Labrador and Baffin Island, is discussed in
detail here, because the concepts derived from
studies of this margin have greatly influenced
development of the model of a restricted Arctic
ice cover during the late Wisconsin glaciation. At
its maximum, the northeastern margin of the Lau-
rentide Ice Sheet extended from the Maritime
Provinces to northern Baffin Island. Along this
margin, the coastal mountains of Labrador-Un-
gava and Baffin Island are the dissected edges of
plateau blocks that have been uplifted and tilted.
Of two early views of Wisconsin ice extent, the
first proposed limited Wisconsin ice extent. Fol-
lowing the work by Lieber (1861), Daly (1902)
suggested that the Torngat Mountains in Labra-
dor were not overtopped by Labradorean (Lau-
rentide) ice that streamed through deep troughs
toward the Atlantic. This conclusion was based
largely on the observed upper limit of glacier
deposits, as well as on the presence of wide-
spread felsenmeer at high levels. Coleman (1920,
1921) later agreed with these conclusions and
even argued that Laurentide ice did not reach
the Atlantic. Coleman (1921, 1926) further pos-
tulated that Wisconsin Laurentide ice did not
overrun the southeast coast of Labrador and that
the widespread presence of high-lying felsen-
meer suggests that much of Newfoundland re-
mained free of ice throughout Wisconsin time.
The second early theory, which supported more-
extensive Wisconsin ice, was put forward by
Odell (1933) and accepted by Tanner (1944). The
main evidence cited for this viewpoint was the
presence of high-level erratics and poorly pre-
served striations; the felsenmeer was assigned a
postglacial age. Flint and others (1942) postu-
lated, on the basis of high erratics and striated
surfaces, that the Shickshock Mountains in the
Gaspe Peninsula were overrun by Wisconsin ice;
felsenmeer on the summits was again thought to
have originated in postglacial time. Subse-
quently, Flint (1971, p. 484-485) inferred that the
Laurentide Ice Sheet overran all coastal high-
lands between New York and Labrador at some
time during the Wisconsin glaciation.
The modern view of Wisconsin ice extent has
its roots in field work carried out in the past two
decades (reviewed by Ives, 1978). The major re-
sult has been the development of the weathering
2zone concept. The weathering zones envisioned
are not to be confused with the geologic terms
''weathering zone'' or ''zone of weathering,'
which refer to a weathered zone in bedrock or
regolith that is nearly parallel with the surface
(Flint, 1971, p. 287). Rather, it refers to ''units of
the land surface which are distinguishable from
each other on the basis of the distinct weathering
features that record different lengths of time
through which they have formed'' (Dyke, 1977,
p. 40). Three broad weathering zones, as well as
possible subdivisions, have been recognized
along the entire northeastern margin of the Lau-
have played an important role in recession of
southern and western LLaurentide terrestrial mar-
gins, because the deeper lakes may temporarily
have given these margins a marine character. If
ice streams entering the proglacial lakes became
afloat, they woule have acquired the same ability
to pull ice out of the ice sheet, as did floating
ice-stream tongues along LLaurentide marine mar-
gins. This suggests that calving bays in the
deeper proglacial lakes could have migrated up
the ice-stream channels and have cleared ice
from these lake basins.
Downdraw of the northwestern sector of the
Laurentide Ice Sheet, and perhaps of the western
margin of the Innuitian Ice Sheet, through ma-
rine ice streams was probably underway by 14,-
000 BP, because calving bays had propagated
into M'Clure Strait and probably into Amundsen
Gulf by 12,600 BP and because Prince Patrick
Island was at least partially free of ice by 11,660
BP. It is rather striking that deglaciation of coasts
or inter-island channels elsewhere in the Queen
Elizabeth Islands or along the northern Lauren-
tide margin apparently had not occurred by this
time.
Disintegration of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet
after 14,000 BP may have been rapid along its
eastern and western margins tor several reasons.
Dissipation of the Laurentide ice fan on the
plains of western Canada may have created an
ice-free corridor in northeastern British Colum-
bia, where merger of the Laurentide and Cordil-
leran Ice Sheets may have previously created an
ice saddle. Ice saddles typically are high enough
to lie above the equilibrium line, so the eastern
Cordilleran margin in northwestern Alberta and
northeastern British Columbia was probably in
an accumulation zone when the saddle existed,
but was suddenly thrown into an ice-ablation
zone after the corridor formed. This might have
thrown this portion of the eastern margin of the
Cordilleran Ice Sheet into a negative mass bal-
ance regime, causing rapid retreat. The western
margin retreated when calving bays carved away
any ice-shelf fringe confined in the straits and
sounds or pinned by the island archipelago aloug
the Pacific coast. Removal of any ice-shelf fringe,
as well as sea-level rise and climatic warming,
would have allowed ice streams occupying fiords
in the Coast Mountains to surge. Such surges
could downdraw the western fringe of the Cor-
dilleran Ice Sheet, allowing calving bays to mi-
grate into the coastal fiords. The southern margin
receded by marginal recession and downwasting.
General recession after 14,000 BP, which appar-
ently was interrupted only by the Sumas read-
vance, left only mountain-glacier complexes and
possibly residual ice caps by 9000 BP.
Figure 2-6 shows our reconstruction of glaciol-
ogical conditions at 10,000 BP, after ice fans
along the southern and western terrestrial mar-
gins of the Laurentide Ice Sheet had been re-
placed by proglacial lakes in the Great Lakes and
the Great Plains and after possible ice shelves
along the northern and northeastern Laurentide
Ice Sheet marine margins had been replaced by
open waters in the Arctic Ocean and Baffin Bay.
A calving bay had migrated up the Amundsen
Gulf ice stream as far as Queen Maud Gulf, but
an ice stream still occupied much of M'Clure
Strait. Downdraw of Innuitian and northern Lau-
rentide ice was caused by surging ice streams
passing through LLancaster Sound, through inter-
island channels leading outward from the central
Norwegian Bay area of the Queen Elizabeth Is-
lands, and through channels between Ellesmere
Island and Greenland.
The overall chronology of northern deglacia-
tion shows delayed ice recession with the first
deglaciation in the west about 12,600 BP, fol-
lowed by progressively younger deglaciation in
the east. This northern marine deglaciation is
thus distinctly different from southern terrestrial
deglaciation in timing and pattern. As indicated
in Chapter S, we think that the pattern and chro-
nology of northern deglaciation reflect recession
of an ice shelf on the Arctic Ocean that, in turn,
regulated downdraw through northern ice
streams and subsequent inland propagation of
calving bays.
North American Ice Sheets: 10,000 BP to 6000
BP. The central event of this interval was the
final collapse of the Innuitian and Laurentide
Ice Sheets, caused largely by downdraw through
surging marine ice streams followed by calving-
bay migration up ice-stream channels. By this
mechanism, the Parry Channel south of the
Queen Elizabeth Islands opened between 9500
and 9000 BP, the channel between Ellesmere
Island and Greenland began to open by 9500 BP,
and most interisland channels beneath the In-
nuitian Ice Sheet were carved out by about 9000
BP. Calving bays propagated deep into northern
lLaurentide ice between 9500 and 8800 BP.
Meanwhile, continued downdraw through the
surging Hudson Strait ice stream greatly deep-
ened the Hudson Bay ice saddle, leading to
not bordered by ice shelves and terrestrial mar-
gins bordered by deep proglacial lakes.
Conclusions. These glaciological speculations
emphasize that marine ice-sheet dynamics dom-
inated late Wisconsin collapse of the eastern,
northeastern, northern, and interior sectors of the
Laurentide Ice Sheet, as well as all sectors of the
Innuitian Ice Sheet; these dynamics are dis-
cussed in more detail in Chapters 7 and 8. Thus
large quantities of atmospheric heat need not be
invoked to melt these ice sheets, because surging
ice streams on marine margins transported inter-
ior ice seaward, where it could melt. Ice would
therefore be transported to the heat source,
rather than the reverse. Also, the predominance
of marine dynamics means that the climatic
change necessary to induce overall late Wiscon-
sin deglaciation need not be extraordinarily
large, for the ice sheet could partly self-destruct
through the positive feedback mechanisms de-
scribed in Chapter 8. In short, climatic amelio-
ration could melt southern terrestrial ice-sheet
sectors, leading to a sea-level rise that could in-
duce further collapse of marine margins because
of their inherent instability. For example, sea-
level rise caused by climatic warming during the
Erie interstade could trigger increased down-
draw through the Laurentian and Hudson Strait
ice streams, as well as recession of the marine
West Antarctic Ice Sheet (Chapter 7) and marine
sectors of other ice sheets, The secondary sea-
level rise induced by downdraw could, in turn,
trigger further marine recession. The predomi-
nance of marine processes in the northern, north-
eastern, and interior sectors of the Laurentide
Ice Sheet also explains the asymmetrical reces-
sion toward Baffin Island, whose high eastern
rim would protect the northeastern flank of the
ice sheet from marine inroads, delaying ice col-
lapse until calving bays eventually propagated
into Foxe Basin, These processes may not have
been restricted solely to marine ice-sheet mar-
gins; they may also have operated where deep
proglacial lakes abutted retreating terrestrial
margins.
The glaciological speculations given in this
section highlight the southern terrestrial margin
of the Laurentide Ice Sheet as the most likely
area for climatic reversals to cause readvances
superimposed on overall late Wisconsin degla-
ciation. This is because widespread late Wiscon-
sin stagnation may have characterized much of
the western sector and because climatic reversals
may not have affected ongoing downdraw and
calving-bay migration in marine ice-sheet sec-
tors, However, caution must be exercised in in-
terpreting widespread fluctuations of the south-
ern Laurentide margin in terms of climatic
change, because downdraw through marine sec-
tors could have controlled the positions of inter-
ior domes and saddles, thereby influencing events
on far-distant terrestrial margins.
One major component of the Antarctic Ice
Sheet-namely, ice shelves-has been largely ig-
nored in this discussion of North American ice
sheets, The possible role of large ice shelves in
the late Wisconsin history of Northern Hemi-
sphere ice sheets is discussed in Chapter 8, in-
cluding the following two points. First, it is quite
possible that large late Wisconsin ice shelves
covered the Arctic Ocean and Baffin Bay; if so,
they may have regulated outward flow through
marine ice streams. The effect of ice shelves in
buttressing ice streams is discussed in Chapter
7. Second, our discussion of deglaciation of
northern marine ice assumes that the oldest
shells from near the marine limit closely postdate
grounding-line recession. This ignores the pos-
sibility that the highest shell-bearing marine sed-
iments or beaches may reflect recession of ice-
shelf calving fronts rather than recession of ice-
shelf grounding lines. In either case, the geologic
record would miss a major element of deglacia-
tion-namely, the prolonged downdraw through
surging ice streams that preceded propagation of
calving bays up former ice-stream channels.

ice tongues are weak links between ice shelves
and ice streams partly because of surface warm-
ing by katabatic winds. Surface warming de-
creases ice-hardness parameter A in the flow law
of ice.
A rapid increase in the intensity of surface cre-
Vasses seems to occur when ice streams move
faster than about 500 m/yr. Photographs of Ant-
arctic ice streams on both sides of this velocity
threshold show the surface transformation
(Swithinbank, 1964, 1977). The ice-stream sur-
face is completely transformed from a relatively
smooth featureless landscape to a chaotic jumble
of large seracs and crevasses arrayed in alternat-
ing ridges and furrows aligned with the flow di-
rection, This transformation also occurs during
surges of mountain glaciers, so it is natural to
conclude that fast-moving, heavily crevassed
Antarctic ice streams are in a continuously surg-
ing state (Weertman, 1969). However, a correla-
tion of the lengths of ice-stream tongues with the
intensity of ice-stream crevassing suggests that
surges come and go for some of the important ice
streams supplying West Antarctic ice to the Ross
lce Shelf (Hughes, 1975).
Surface ablation of ice streams by katabatic
winds is increased manyfold when ice-stream
velocity crosses the surge threshold, because the
change in crevasse intensity greatly increases the
ice-stream surface area exposed to melting, evap-
oration, and sublimation. Unevaporated surface
meltwater flows into crevasses and refreezes be-
fore ice crosses the grounding line, This warms
the ice stream by releasing latent heat but does
not contribute to ablation. After ice crosses the
grounding line, the bottom surface can also be-
come heavily crevassed, and water-filled bottom
crevasses can migrate upward to meet surface
crevasses, The amount of surface meltwater that
flows into surface crevasses and reaches water-
filled bottom crevasses without refreezing con-
tributes to surface ablation. Since the latent heat
of evaporation is over seven times the latent heat
of melting, if only one-seventh of the surface
meltwater enters crevasses and escapes refreez-
ing, it still causes as much surface ablation as
evaporation does, Surface ablation by sublima-
tion occurs primarily during the cold Antarctic
night. Sublimation is an important component of
surface ablation on Antarctic glaciers (Bull and
Carnein, 1970) and sublimation rates should in-
crease as dry katabatic winds respond to climatic
warming.
Even if climatic warming does not throw the
surface of an ice shelf into an ablation regime,
thus creating a dendritic network of surface melt-
water streams that drain into crevasses in the ice-
stream and bedrock weak links of the ice shelf,
climatic warming can affect ice-stream weak
links if the ice streams are already in an ablation
regime from katabatic winds and if their surface
areas are already heavily crevassed by a surge.
The major effect is to thin the ice stream by
increasing surface ablation, so that the ice-stream
grounding line is forced to retreat.
Basal melting along ice-shelf grounding lines
has received little attention, and no attempt has
been made to measure it directly. This is unfor-
tunate, because determining whether ice-shelf
grounding lines in Antarctica are currently re-
treating or advancing depends in large measure
on the rates of melting or freezing along these
grounding lines. Hughes (1972, 1973) first sug-
gested that basal melting prevailed along Ross
Ice Shelf grounding lines of the West Antarctic
Ice Sheet, because most glacial geological and
glaciological work by others seemed to indicate
that the Ross Sea sector of the West Antarctic Ice
Sheet continued to collapse in Holocene time
after the disintegration of Northern Hemisphere
ice sheets no longer contributed to rising sea
level. Basal melting along ice-shelf grounding
lines, particularly where ice streams entered the
ice shelf, seemed to be the best way to continue
disintegration of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet;
because basal melting would have the same ef-
fect as increasing sea level-namely, by forcing
ice-shelf grounding lines to retreat.
Using data from the RISS traverse, Hughes
(1972) attempted to determine whether basal
melting or freezing exists today along the Siple
Coast grounding line of the Ross Ice Shelf. His
study is not generally available so it is repro-
duced here in amended form. According to Fig-
ure 7-37, about the same degree of bending con-
verging flow occurs between the grounding line
of ice stream C and RISS station 133 as occurs
between RISS stations 133 and 53. Insofar as the
average ice hardness parameter A depends on
the stress field, it should be about the same for
both flowline segments. Applying equation (88)
to the segment between RISS stations 133 and
53, we find

As discussed in the Appendix, it is difficult to assign appropriate

absorption calibration curves. For smectite and alkali feldspar, the
estimated error is believed to be approximately 6-10% whenn the phase is
abundant (-50 modal percent), but mx:h greater, approximately 33%, whhen
the phase is present in only minor amounts ( -3 modal percent). For
reasons explained in the report, estimated errors in calculated weight
percents of zeolites are believed to be somewhat larger than corre-
sponding values for smectite and alkali feldsper.

1. Topopeh Spring tuff from Busted Butte is similar texturally to the
samples of Topopah Spring tuff from borehole USWG1, but the outcrop
material and core material differ somewhat mineralogically. For
example, the two core samples were found to have lower
qguartz/cristobalite ratios. More importantly, however, the core
samples contain significant quantities of smectite (approximately 10X
by weight), whereas the outcrop material from Busted Butte contains
only trace amounts of smectite.
2. No ma,jor differences in bulk or clay mineralogy were detected among
the five size fractions of Busted Butte outcrop material. In fact, the
samples exhibited only one minor mineralogic variation: an apparent
decrease in quartz and a concomitant increase in alkali feldsper with
decreasing mesh size.

Fifteen liters (4 gal) of J-13 well water were received from the U.S.
At 25% C and near pH 7 the uranyl carbonate, hydroxide, and pyro-
phosphate will react with sulfide to precipitate pitchblende which has a very
small crystallite size, The concentration of uranium in solution when
either the uranyl carbonate or hydroxide reacts with the sulfide ion is less
than 10- M[. The uranyl pyrophosphate reaction with sulfide has been
only qualitatively investigated. Uranyl fluoride reacts with the sulfide
ion at 25 C to precipitate uranium tetrafluoride, UF,, The uranium in
solution above UF, is less than 10- Mi. The sulfide ion has no effect on
the solubility of uranium IV in solution other than to assist in keeping it
in its reduced state. The hydroxide ion, however, reacts with uranium IV'
at 25f C near pH 7 to precipitate pitchblende. It has a very small crystallite
size.
At the elevated temperature of 215 C and near pH 7 uranyl carbonate,
hydroxide, fluoride, and pyrophosphate react with sulfide, sulfite, and hy-
drogen gas to precipitate pitchblende which has a large crystallite size.
The concentration of uranium in solution above the pitchblende is less than
10- M, when sulfide ions react with uranyl carbonate, hydroxide and
fluoride at 215* C. Uranium IV in an inert or HgS atmosphere at 215? C
and near pH 7 reacts with water to precipitate pitchblende. It has a large
crystallite size. The concentration of uranium in solution above the
pitchblende is less than 10- M.
Foreign cations are known to react with complex uranium ions and form
precipitates. They will also change the chemical properties of solutions,

PREPARATION OF MAP
The drainage basins above each gaging
station were outlined on tracing paper laid
over Geological Survey base maps of, the United
States, and the figures of aversge runoff were
entered within the basin outlines. The base
maps used were those showing drainage and re-
11er.
Wherever possible , opportunity was taken
to oalculate runoff from partisl bas in areas
and thus define areal variations in runoff
more close ly. This was done by subtracting
the flow at one or more upstream stations from
that at a domnstream a tation. It m1st be rec-
ognized that the runoff thus computed for an
intervening area comonly represents the dif-
ference be tween two comparative ly large qusn-
tities and is sub ject to a relatively large
error either tn the figures of discharge or in
the drainage area. Neverthe less, such sub-
traction when expressed in terms of discharge
per unit of ares produces a result that is
highly informative in connection with the
study of the geographic distribution of runoff.
The runoff isograms were drawn so thst
the figure plotted would conform to the aver-
age runoff in each basin or partial basin.- In
basins where the runoff vsried greatly, the
delineation of the isograms was aided by s tudy
of the general pa ttern, by reference to pre-
oipitation, or by knowledge of the terrain.
lIn such basins the extremes in runoff may be
greatly in error - for example, along mountain
3. For snapshot simulations of, e.g., 50 or 100 m.y. ago, the paleogeogra-
phy and SST boundary conditions and the paleoclimatic data used for com-
parison with the simulated results are averaged over a 1- to 5-m.y, period.
Therefore, the distribution of solar radiation with latitude and season should
be an average calculated over many cycles of orbital periodicities.
5.4.5. AtmosphericAerosol Content. It is well known from both observa-
tionsand climate modeling(Toon and Pollack, 1980; Turco et al., 1982)that
atmospheric aerosols can affect climate. This is because they scatter and
absorb shortwave radiation and absorb and emit infrared radiation (IR)
(Prospero et al., 1983). Observations of surface temperature anomalies
following major volcanic eruptions and the results of climate modeling
indicate that stratospheric aerosols increase the temperature in the lower
stratosphere and reduce surface temperature. This is because the effect due
to the increase in planetary albedo is greater than that due to the absorption
and emission of IR (Pollack et al., 1976).
Stratospheric aerosol content is closely related to one source, explosive
volcanic eruptions that periodically inject silicate dust particles and sulfur
gases (HS, SO4) into the stratosphere. The sulfur gases are converted
through photochemical reactions to sulfuric acid particles. After major
eruptions, stratospheric aerosols decline to background levels after 1- 2 yr
(Castleman et al., 1974). While the mean global atmospheric optical depth
(r)due to aerosol is in the range 0.05 to 0.2 (Deirmendjian, 1971; Pollack et
al., 1976), and major eruptions can increase this to 0.4-0.5 for several
months, the mean volcanic contribution over the last few centuries to total
atmospheric aerosol r has been - 0.02, constituting about 80% of the total
stratospheric aerosol r (Pollack et al., 1976). Therefore, periods of en-
hanced volcanicactivity in the geological past could have had climaticeffects
through increased r. Approximate estimates of the variation of strato-
spheric aerosol content can be made, given a knowledge of changes in the
global rate ofvolcanism through time. This could be achieved by the follow-
ing methods.
1. Major volcanic episodes (lasting maybe a few million years) can be
recognized in the geologic record from widespread and thick ash horizons
(Axelrod, 1981). However, there is insufficient data to document changes
in the global rate of volcanism with any confidence.
2. The global average ocean floor spreading rate slowly varies over tens of
millions of years. This must affect mean rates of volcanism at midocean
ridges and in island arcs and Andean mountain belts along destructive plate
margins. Hays and Pitman (1973)argued that the mean ocean floor spread-
ingrate between 110 and 85 m.y. ago was double the presentvalue [although
during the last few hundred years (125). It may also
signify a decrease in local weed (NAP) pollen produc-
tion, to be expected when a pueblo or other prehistoric
village was abandoned. An apparent increase in tree
pollen would accompany the decrease in herb pollen
following abandonment and the end of disturbance by
man, without benefit of forest expansion or climatic
change.
In brief, the major features of postpluvial climatic
history are threefold: an initial arid period (zone IV)
climatically equivalent to the present and dating 8,000
- 10,500 B. P.; next, a less arid interval (zone III)
with an intensified monsoon rainfall, the climate per-
haps no warmer but slightly wetter than at present, and
corresponding in time to the classic ''altithermal,'' 4,000
to 8,000 B. P.; and finally an arid period (zones I and
II) closely resembling present conditions but with at
least one possible shift in the seasonal distribution of
rainfall and lasting from 4,000 B. P. to the present.
There is a strong resemblance to the classic threefold
postglacial pollen sequence of von Post.
IX. A REAPPRAISAL OF POSTPLUVIAL CLIMATES
Recent pollen analysis of pluvial lake sediments
sustains the view of most geologists that glacio-pluvial
climates of arid America were decidedly colder and
wetter than the present. It is within the postpluvial pe-
riod that the desert grassland pollen chronology fails
to support the climatic interpretations of certain pre-
vious workers, Foremost is lack of pollen evidence of
pluvial conditions at the Sulphur Spring stage type
locality (profile of Double Adobe I).
According to Antevs (151) ''The bones of the
extinct animals, the much greater moisture indicated
by the hickory, the permanent river, and the lakelet
show that ... the beds ... were deposited during the
last Pluvial, the correlative of the last glaciation in
western North America.'' In 1942, Bryan visited the Sul-
phur Spring valley and confirmed Antevs' interpreta-
tion that the alluvial beds of the Sulphur Spring stage
were deposited at a time wetter than the present (27).
But the pollen record of Sulphur Spring stage sediments
bears no resemblance to the pollen of pluvial-age sedi-
ments of the Willcox Playa and makes a pluvial climate
and age virtually impossible.
A second and perhaps more provocative discovery
is the high frequency of moisture indicators including
tree pollen in the middle of the postpluvial pollen rec-
ord. This suggests a moist, not a dry altithermal. It
led me to re-examine the Bryan-Antevs model of post-
pluvial climates which is commonplace in the literature
of Southwestern prehistory. The discord does not in-
volve the Bryan-Antevs älluvial chronology, based on
reasonably secure field evidence of synchronous epi-
sodes of deposition and erosion in Southwestern flood
SEcToN 5,--IDLLUSTRaTIONS OF G EOLOGICAL STRUCTUEE.
It is customary to consult the older and usually the more thoroughly
consolidated stratified rocks for illustration of geological structure, but, as
such feattnnres are in many cases the records of the manner in whichh the
beds were deposited, it is evident that they should occur in thhe newest as
well as the oldest formations. It is well known that the history of the earth
is a continuous record, however fragmentary it may seem at the present
day, and that the processes of nature have been the same throughout thhe
geological ages, Nowhere are these axioms more thoroughly sustained
than in the recently desiccated lake basins of the Far West, As the gravels
and finer sediments deposited in Lake Lahontan afford many instructive
records of the circumstances under which they were accumulated, we have
prepared the following brief summary of observations relating to geologic
structure due to deposition, erosion, etc., believing that it will assist in inter-
preting similar phenomena when observed in older rocks, where they are
frequently obscured by metamorphism and other changes.
STRATIEICATION AND LAMINATION.
The sediments forming the upper and lower portions of the Lahontan
section consist of fine, homogeneous, evenly-stratified marly-clays, which
show a distinct lamination parallel with the planes of bedding. Attention
is called to the lamination of these deposits in connection with other features
due to deposition, as it has manifestly resulted from the slow accumulation
of fine sediments in thin layers, and does not owe its existence to pressure,
as is the case in many older rocks, This is evident since both the upper
and lower clays are alike laminated, while the higher members of the series
at least have never been subjected to the pressure of superimposed deposits,
CURRENT BEDDING.
The gravels separating the upper and lower Lahontan clays are char-
acterized by extreme irregularity, and afford many illustrations of structure
due to deposition, They were deposited in the shallow waters and were
much agitated by waves and currents, and among other features present
and, (ii) that
estimated consumptive use by man for that year was added to
the actual volume, giving an adjusted volume and correspond-
ing surface area. The increase in area was multiplied by the
estimated rate of evaporation to calculate the increase in
evaporation loss. Subtracting this evaporation loss from the
first adjusted volume gave a final adjusted volume and a net
gain in volume for the year equal to man's consumptive use
less the increased evaporation loss. The net gain in volume was
then added to the volume corresponding to the observed mean
elevation for the next year (1852), and the computations were
repeated. The evaporation factor was applied only to the
computed increase in area; the actual evaporation loss from
the total lake surface did not enter into the computations.
Computations for the entire period of record were run on a
digital computer, using a program prepared by E. L. Peck, and
another computation was also run for the period of statehood,
1896--1965. The mean annual elevations of G reat Salt Lake
for the period 1851--1965, adjusted for the computed effects
of man's consumptive use, are plotted along with the observed
elevations in figure 3. Results of the computation for
1896--1965 gave the same adjusted elevation for 1965. The
computed cumulative reduction in lake elevation caused by
consumptive use of water in the drainage basin for the period
1851- 1965 was 5.28 feet.

the group given only a single course. This makes the study especially
valuable, because the time of the split-dose x-ray exposure can be clearly
specified.
On January 1, 1970, the group not re-treated with a second course
numbered 4,420 patients still alive and 1,759 who had died (477 had
emigrated or were otherwise lost to followup). A more extensive report
of this followup has been made available to the Committee (R. Doll
and P. G. Smith, personal communication) and was included in the
1977 uNscEAR report.
UUnfortunately, no radiation-exposure data for these patients have been
published since the original very detailed analysis in 1957. In the
following section, the doses delivered to various tissues in this group
are estimated. We believe that these estimates are valid at least to
within S0%, and they have been used to calculate risk estimates from
the epidemiologic evidence of excess cancers (by site) observed in these
patients.
ESTIMATES OF RADIATION DOSES IN TISSUES AND ORGANS
IN THE SINGLE-COURSE RADIOTHERAPY PATIENTS TREATED
FOR ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS IN ENGLAND AND WALES
The available data on patients with ankylosing spondylitis who received
a single treatment course with x rays in the Doll and Smith study%.'3
were reviewed, to estimate average radiation doses in tissues and organs
giving rise to excess leukemias and cancers of heavily irradiated sites.
It was not possible to review the radiotherapy charts of each patient,
and it was therefore necessary to make assumptions on, for example,
the selection of patients, the extent and severity of disease, the method
of therapy, the radiotherapy dosimetry and exposures, the tissues ir-
radiated, and the doses absorbed. The number of assumptions was kept
to a minimum; it was recognized that the selection of patients and the
clinical courses of treatment chosen by the radiotherapist in individual
cases were, understandably, extremely variable. In spite of these limita-
tions, however, it has been possible to make reasonable assumptions
and to develop a model of what probably occurred in the radiotherapy
planning and treatment of these patients, on the basis of conventional
orthovoltage radiotherapy of the 19304-1950s. The estimates of radiation
doses absorbed thus derived, however, are imprecise and must be further
corrected as new information becomes available, not only with respect
to the assumptions made above, but also with respect to subtle informa-
tion still lacking-for example, on the location of the organ during
treatment and on the fraction of the organ or tissue that was irradiated.

Introduction
The electrochemical nature of corrosion would be only of
ninor or academic interest to the corrosion engineer if it
provided merely an additional rmethod of measuring average
corrosion rate, The standard gravimetric method of weigh-
ing the amount of metal reacted during a specified time can
yield adequate accuracy when good descaling procedures
are used. The gravimetric method is generally satisfactory
and it still widely used in investigating corroding systerms of
industrial importance. Corrosion rate measured by rmetal
weight loss is, however, an average value over a relatively
long reaction time.
The electrochemical nature of corrosion provides a
means of determining an almost instantaneous corrosion
rate. Over the time interval required to obtain a gravirmetric
corrosion rate, one can follow electrochemically how the
rate varies with time, The mean corrosion rate, obtained by
integration of the rate/time curve, should be equal to the
rate obtained by descaled weight loss.
Consider the reaction of iron in sulfuric acid to form
ferrous sulfate:
or by the rate of the cathodic process:
where D is the metal density in g cm '', d day, and y
year,
Unfortunately, one cannot simply hook up an armmeter
to any naturally corroding metal and measure the current
equivalent to the instantaneous corrosion rate, because this
current is internally shorted, There are, however, three
fundamental concepts which can be brougYt into play to
develop electrochemical techniques for measuring corrosion
rate.
Tsfel Equation
Fundamental Concepts
In 1905, Tafel' found that the cuent equivalent to
the rate of a sfnge electrode reaction on a metal surface is
related to the potential of the metal bby
where E is the potential measured with respect to a selected
reference electrode, a and b being constants. The Tafel
equation has been confirmed experimentally for a wide
variety of individual anodic and cathodic reactions. Con-
stants a and b can be predicted theoretically for many
reaction mechanisms,' Foor the purpose of this report, the
Tafel slope, b s dE/d log 1, is considered an experimental
quantity characteristic of a particular anodic process (b,) or
cathodic process (b), not a theoretical quantity calculated
from the reaction model.
Additiviry Principle
A naturally corroding metal always has more than one
electrochemical process occurring on its surface at a
measurable rate, These must include at least one anodic
process and one cathodic. If external current is applied to
the corroding metal to change its potential, the potential
change affects the rates of all electrochemical processes at
the metal surface, This is depicted graphically in Figure 1.
The system represented in Figure 1 it a generalized
corroding metal on which there are three reactions desig-
gted by prine, double prirme, and triple prme, the three
reactions having reversible potentials E,', E,'', and E,''',
The lines represent linear Tafel (E vs iog 1) plots for the
anodc and cathodic processes of each reaction, The current
for any one of these processes is referred to as a partial
current, and it represents the rate of that process.

cracks to be transgranular and Royuela and Staehle
detected both intergranular and transgranular cracking.
There is a clear trend for sasceptibility to cricking to
follow the nickel content regardless of the crystal structure
(ferritic vs austenitic) and alloy base (Fe, FeCr, Fe-Cr-Mn).
The effect of chromium variation on the Fe-Ni base has
not been so extensively studied. The first extensive study
by Denhard? showed that increasing chromium in a
Fe-12Ni base increased its susceptibility to cracking in
boiling MgCl. His data are summarized in Figure 54. A
range of Ni-Cr variations has been studied by both Truman
and Perry' * (10-25 Cr, 15-45 Ni) and Evans and Burm'
(16-35 Cr, 8-41 Ni). These results tend to show a minimum
in cracking generally at 20% Cr with less susceptibility at
higher and lower chromium. The work of Truman and
Perry was more specific with respect to cracking times.
They also investigated MgClg, CaCl,, 3 and 10% NaCl at
250 C, NaCl at 330 C, condensing steam and caustic with
most tests being in tension. Typical results from their work
are summarized in Figure 55. Royuela and Staehle'8' have
investigated the effect of a broad range of chromium and
in the solution annealed (705 C) condition. Steel A was
hardened to Rg 19 by annealing (705 C), air cooling,
austenitizing (982 C), oil quenching and tempering at 649
C, and to R, 34 by tempering at 538 C. Steel B was
hardened to R 18 as above but was tempered at 593 C.
Steel B was tempered at 510 C in order to obtain a hardness
of R, 34. As can be seen from the above tempering
temperatures, the two steels respond to tempering slightly
differently. Likewise, the mechanical properties are some-
what different as can be seen from Table 2. The structures
were fully martensitic when hardened and tempered.
In order to determine whether steels A and B had
different responses to other chemical media and to electro-
chemical polarization, wires were prepared from each steel
and testt were conducted in apparatus resembling van
Rooyen's.' Mediz evaluated (besides 42% boiling MgCl4)
included: dilute HC1 + SeO4, 4iluts H4SO, + SeOg, dilute
aoetic acid + (NH,)YS, boiling 3% NaCl, nd boiling 3%
NaCl + CS4. Although many testt were performed with
anodic, cathodic and no applied currents (at several tensile
loads), only little differences were found in the behavior of
steels A and B-except in MgCl, without applied currents.
Only Steel B appeared ssceptible to stress corrosion
cracking in boiling 42% by weight MgCl; without an
applied current. The environments purported to accelerate
hydrogen embrittlement (such as dilute acetic acid +
(NH,)S) acted more quickly upon Steel A but both steels
did crack, and fracture paths appeared to be very similar. In
fact, the crack path in all environhents, for both steels, was
extremely similar. The cracks follow an.intergranular path
astociated with the prior austenite gains. The one major
exception, it the crack path in Steel B when tested in
boiling 42% MgCl4, either without an applied current or
with anodic polarization. As can be seen from Figures 1, 2,
3, and 4 the cracks have more of a transgrannlar
appearance, as well as much more branching. Figures S and
6 are examples of cracks in other media or under cathodic
polarization.
I believe that these data do show that although the 12%
chromium martensitic steels are susceptible to hydrogen
embrittlement and anodic accelerated cracking, the
presence of 1.76% Ni in the alloy leads to a unique cracking
behavior in boiling 42% MgCl without any applied current.

not only occur at the grain boundaries, but on slip bands
and pearlite lamellae as well, and this causes a renewed
decrease in the time to fracture. In an annealed 0.28% C
steel, Zabik' did not observe such effects. The time to
fracture decreased regularly with increasing load. This was
evidently due to the much lower ductdity of that steel
when compared with low-carbon iron and annealed 0.14%

Concentration vs Boiling Temperature of
Magnesium Chloride Solutions
M. A. Streicher and 1. B. Casale
Introduction
The temperature of boiling magnesium chloride solu-
tions, which are used to detect the susceptibility of stainless
steel alloys to stress corrosion cracking has a pronounced
effect on the measured time to failure. A discrepancy
between the boilingpointconcentration relationship was
brought to our attention when a series of 42 wt % solutions
was prepared in the Engineering Materials laboratory and a
boiling point observed that was apparently low by almost
10 C compared with values often cited in the literature. In
an attempt to resolve this discrepancy, atmospheri4
boilingpoint data were assembled from the literature for
MgCl; solutions in the 0-46 wt % concentration range.
These data were supplemented by new experimental
determinations on 40-46 wt % MgCl, -the concentration
range of greatest interest in stress corrosion tests-for which
little information was available.
The concentration in general use was apparently
proposed by Scheil,' who reported preparing a ''solution
containing approximately 1375 gm of MgCl, - 6H4O and
150 ml H4O boiling at 309 F (154 C)... This solution
contains about 42 wt % MgCl;. Numerous authors''? have
cited this paper and have reported preparing 42 wt % MgCls
solutions with boiling points of 154 C.
In 1961 Barnartt and van Rooyen' called attention to
the inconsistency in the reported boiling point. They
measured a boiling point of 146 C at 730 mm Hg for a 42.5
wt % MgCl;. These data, when corrected to 760 mrm Hg,
yield a value of 147.0 C, in good agreement with data
published by Pershke and Kalinin' in 1932, which plot to

On ramnfall analyses of the 1976 Big Thompson storm for the two
basins are 153 and 110 m'/s (Miller and others, 1978) (Table 6).
Ihese values are also closer to the paleohydraulic values than are
the slope-area estimates. Thus, two independent indirect discharge
cstimates give peak discharge estimates similar to those calculated
by the paleohydraulic technique developed here, but significantly
less than the published conventional slope-area discharge estimates
(Table 6). These results support the suggestion that excessive chan-
nel scour in small mountain tributaries could cause slope-area dis-
charge estimates to be too large.
A second explanation for why most paleohydraulic recon-
Structed discharges on small streams are lower than those estimated
by slope-area techniques may be that slope-area methods require
the estimation of a roughness coefficient (n). Typical values conss-
tently selected for large floods in small mountain channels are n =
0.035 to 0.06. Research on verification of roughness coefficients for
steep mountain channels recently completed (R. D. Jarrett, unpub.
data) indicates that these n values may be too low by factors of 1,5
o 2.0. Higher values would reduce velocities and result in lower
lope-area discharge estimates.
Finally, the fundamental assumptions that particles of all sizes
are avalable for transport in small, steep mountam valleys and that
flood velocty and depth (actually depth-slope product) are
reflected in the suze of boulders in flood deposits must be examned.
lLarge floods may have been able to move boulders larger than
those that were avalable. This may be the case in Sawmill Gulch
(Table 6, site 9), which follows a major shear zone along which
uranium enrchment occurs (Sims and Sheridan, 1964). Fault
movements have crushed and broken the bedrock along closely
Spaced jonts and fractures, and consequently there are no very
large boulders avalable to be moved during a large flood. The
Second assumption, that average velocity and depth can be recon-
Structed from particle size wth reasonable accuracy, requires that
the methods selected, premises, and numertcal values estimated rea-
Sonably approximate processes and conditions in the field. Unfor-
tunately, the hazards entailed in compiling actual measurements
and observations during catastrophic floods preclude any substan-
1al direct emprical corroboration,

while the soil is wet and conductive enough to supply w.iter to the site of
evaporation at a rate commensurate with the evaporative demand. During
this stage, the evaporation rate is limited by, and hence also controlled by,
external meteorological conditions (i.e., radiation, wind, air humidity, etc.)
rather than by the properties of the soil profile. As such, this stage, being
weather controlled, is analogous to the flux-controlled stage of nfiltration (in
contrast with the profile-controlled stage; see Sections B and H, on rain
infiltration, in Chapter 12). The evaporation rate during this stige might also
be influenced by soil surface conditions, including surface reflectivity and
the possible presence of a mulch, insofar as these can modify the cffect of the
meterorological factors acting on the soil. In a dry climate, this stage of
evaporation is generally brief and may last only a few hours to a few days,
(2) An intermediate falling-rate stage, during whch the evaporation
rate falls progressively below the potential rate (the evaporativty). At this
stage, the evaporation rate is limited or dictated by the rate at which the
gradually drying soil profile can deliver moisture toward the evaporation
zone. Hence it can also be called the soil profile-controlled stage. This stage
may persist for a much longer period than the first stage.
(3) A residual slow-rate stage, which is established eventually and which
may persist at a nearly steady rate for many days, weeks, or even months. This
stage apparently comes about after the surface-zone has become so desiccated
that further liquid-water conduction through it effectively ceases. Water
transmission through the desiccated layer thereafter occurs primarily by the
slow process of vapor diffusion, and it is affected by the vapor diffusivity of
the dried surface zone and by the adsorptive forces acting over molecular
distances at the particle surfaces. This stage is often called the tapor difision
stage and can be important where the surface layer is such that it becomes
quickly desiccated (e.g., a loose assemblage of clods).
Whereas the transition from the first to the second stage is generally a
sharp one, the second stage generally blends into the third stage so gradually
that the last two cannot be separated so easily. A qualitative explanation for
the occurrence of these stages follows.
During the initial stage, the soil surface gradually dries out and soil
moisture is drawn upward in response to steepening evaporation-induced
gradients. The rate of evaporation can remain nearly constant as long as the
moisture gradients toward the surface compensate for the decreasing hy-
draulic conductivity (resulting from the decrease in water content). In terms
of Darcy's law, ; = K(d9/dz), we can restate the above principle by noting
that the flux ; remains constant because the gradient d 9 dz increases suffi-
ciently to offset the decrease of K. Sooner or later, however, the soil surface
approaches equilibrium with the overlying atmosphere 'i e. hecomes ap-
proximately air dry). From this moment on, the moisture gradients toward
the surface cannot increase any more, and in fact, must tend to decrease as
for the purposes of those research and other
studies in which no direct benefit to the per-
sons irradiated is intended, in circumstances
when the exposure is unrelated to any illness
they may have, should only be undertaken by
properly qualified and trained persons. Such
irradiation should only be given with the
consent of the authorities in charge of the
institution where the irradiation is to take
place, as advised by an appropriate expert
body and subject to local and national regula-
tions. The estimated risks of the irradiation
should be explained to those involved, who
should be volunteers fully able to exercse
ther free will, The higher the dose the more
rigorous should be the requirements on the
conditions of securing true volunteers and on
ther capablity of understanding the risk. It
follows that the irradiation, for the purposes
of such studies, of chldren and other persons
regarded as being incapable of giving their
true consent should only be undertaken if the
expected radiation dose is low (e.g. of the
order of one-tenth of, the dose-equivalent
limitsapplicable to individual members of the
public)and if valid approval has been given by
those legally responsible for such persons.
The individuals exposed under these condi-
tions obtan no direct benefit from their
exposure and it is therefore necessary to
ensure that their detriment remains accept-
able, and thus to set authorized limits. How-
ever, the magnitude of the detriment associ-
ated with the exposure depends on the age and
the state of health of the exposed individual
and it 1s not possible to fi limits of general
applicability. Appropriate limits should
therefore be authorized for each research
program.
The optimization of exposure
(205) The Commission wishes to re-
emphasize that careful attention totechniques
would, in many cases, result in a considerable
reduction of the dose due to medical proced-
ures, without impairment of their value. In
general, the techniques and equipment used
should allow:
the reduction of the doses received by
tissues in the region of the body under
examination to the minimum compatible
with obtaining the necessary information
in the particular patient;
the delivery to the treated region of the
body of a therapeutic dose the magnitude
of which is most likely to ensure the re-
quired response;
the limitation as far as practicable of the
exposure of other parts of the body.
(206) Because of the risk of radiation injury
to any embryo or foetus, the possblity of
pregnancy is one of the factors to be con-
sidered in deciding whether to make a radio-
logcal examination involving the lower
abdomen in a woman of reproductive
capacity. Although such an examination is
least likely to pose any hazard to a developing

Professional training
(208)The Commission wishes to emphasize
theimportance of including adequate traning
on radiation protection in the general educa-
tion and training of individuals entering the
medical and associated professions, since all
those who enter these professions may be
involved in prescribing procedures involving
exposure to ionizing radiation. More
thorough training in radiation protection is
required by those planning to enter the field of
radiology and by scientists and technicians
assisting in the medical uses of radiation.

Because D(0) typically increases rapidly with increasing ? (e.g. Rose 1968, Reichardt
et al, 1972), 20/?x will be large near x = 0, and small elsewhere in the column, pro-
viding 9 s ,. Hence over most of the column 0 will be approximately uniform,
and the rate of outflow will depend on the rate at which this approximately uniform
0 declines with time. We will now assume that the rate of outflow, F, is given by
Vg?, where Y is the volume of the soil and Q is -? lt which we will take to be effec-
tively independent of x, but not of 1. This is tantamount to saying that, apart from
near x == 0, the sshape of the (x) curve is approximately constant. It should remain
so until ? approaches , when D varies little with x, and Doering's (1965) method
(which is based on a constant D) becomes valid. That the above assumption is a
reasonable one is illustrated in Fig. 2, which shows 2/?t (normalized with respect to
dö/dt) as a function of xfL and the mean water content @. The curves were obtained
by numerically solving equation (1) subject to (2) with D an exponential function of

traverse. The boundaries then were projected directly
from the photogrsphs onto the topogrsphic base maps.
Mapping of the grsvel fans involved sufficient trs-
verses on each fan to identify the gravel deposits ac-
cording to their distinctive color and tone on the aerial
photogrsphs. The boundaries of the seversl formstions
then were sketched with much generalization on the
photographs, and these lines were transferred by pro-
jeotion and inspection to the topogrsphic base. In gen-
eral, the boundaries of the older of the lste Pleistocene
gravel (No. 2 grsvel) are shown by the contours; the
younger grsvels commonly sre in such small areas that a
grest deal of generalizatios was necessary, so much so
that accurste projection onto the topogrsphic base
seemed an overrefinement.
The lower parts of the mountains were mapped on
the ground. For the most part the trsverses were
along the valleys and along the ridges, although this is
at right angles to the contacts. The higher parts of
the mountains were mapped by helicopter. Within
limits, this mapping from the air could be checked by
tracing the formations to the lower parts of the moun-
tains where mapping had been done on the ground and
where fossil collections had helped control it. Later,
some of the most questionable aress were checked by
traverses down the ridges snd canyons from the summit
of the Panamint Range to the ffoor of Death Valley.
In the course of mapping the Paleozoic formations,
about 100 collections of fossils were obtained. Their
locations are shown on the geologic map, snd the con-
tents of most of the collections are described with the
formations. It is espected that future work will show
that the formations in some fauhL blocks have been in-
correctly identified, but the fossil collections show the
limits to which such corrections may be exstended.
Fieldwork was interrupted while parts of the study
still were incomplete. In particular, the Tertiary for-
mations, the grsnitic intrusions, and the older of the
Precambrisn sedimentary formations need more study.

Figure 14.--Graph showing phenocrysts and lithic variations in the tuff of Lithic Ridge.
Bedded and Ash-Flow Tuff
The tuff of Lithic Ridge is underlain by approximately 13 m of tuffaceous
sediments, with a thin (approximat@ly 9 m) ash-flow tuff intercalated with the
tuffaceous sediments. This thin ash-flow tuff is very light gray to light
greenish gray, partially welded, and contains 15-20 percent phenocrysts. The
phenocrysts consist of plagioclase, biotite, and sparse sanidine and quartz.
The ash flow apparently has the same phenocryst composition (table 6) and
probably correlates with a thin ash- flow tuff that is present in USW G-1 at
1656-1661 m (F. M. Byers, lr., oral comun., 1982). This thin ash flow in USW
G-1 is the uppermost ash flow of unit C, wnich is the lowest unit of the
''older ash-flow and bedded tuffs'' of USW G-1 (Spengler and others, 1982).
Unit C is approximately 173 m thick in USW G-1, and thins drastically north of
the USW G-1 drill site. No other units of the ''older ash-flow and bedded
tuffc'' of USW G-1 were identified in USW G-2.
these units are left informally designated as the red
sandstone unit in White Basin and east of Frenchman
Mountain, and as the rocks of the Grand Wash trough
in the Grand Wash area, throughout this report.
The Hualapai Limestone presents a special nomen-
clature problem because it is commonly called a formal
member of the Muddy Creek Formation in recent liter-
ature (Blair, 1978; Blair and Armstrong, 1979; and Luc-
chitta, 1972, 1979). Its member status is chiefly based
upon the fact that limestone is interbedded with red
sandstone at the base of the main body of Hualapai
Limestone at Grapevine Mesa, and the red sandstone
has traditionally been termed Muddy Creek. In this
report, however, the red sandstone that is interbedded
with the limestone of the Hualapai is considered to be
part of the rocks of the Grand Wash trough rather than
part of the Muddy Creek. On this basis, it is better to
refer to the Hualapai as part of the rocks of the Grand
Wash trough rather than as a member of the Muddy
Creek. However, the Hualapai extends to the west of
Grapevine Mesa beyond the western limits of the under-
lying red sandstone, where it rests directly on Precam-
brian crystalline rocks. It ultimately extends into
Detrital Valley, where it rests on rocks called Muddy
Creek Formation. Because the stratigraphic relations of
the Hualapai with the Muddy Creek in Detrital Valley
are incompletely understood owing to a paucity of pub-
lished maps and accurate descriptions there, and be-
cause the Hualapai interfingers with informally named
rocks in the Grand Wash trough, it is left unassociated
with either the rocks of the Grand Wash trough or the
Muddy Creek; it is restored here to its original forma-
tional rank (Longwell, 1936) and referred to simply as
the Hualapai Limestone.
The Muddy Creek Formation of Stock (1921) is
slightly reevaluated in this report in that the use of that
term is restricted somewhat. Only rocks that can be
demonstrated to have been stratigraphically continuous
with those of the Muddy Creek type locality are called
Muddy Creek Formation.
AGE OF THE TERTIARY ROCKS
The precise age of the Tertiary nonmarine sedimen-
tary rocks in the Lake Mead region has been poorly doc-
nented largely because fossils are rare to nonexistent,
md because some important unconformities were not
ietected. Although Anderson and others (1972) report
!4 K-Ar determinations from igneous rocks associated
vith the nonmarine sedimentary rocks, the authors did
ot agree among themselves (Anderson and others,
,972, p. 283) that the age determinations were repre-
wentative of the age of the sedimentary rocks. The
disagreement focused upon whether the ages were
determined from lava flows interbedded with the sedi-
mentary rocks or from younger shallow intrusive rocks,
and on whether or not the dates from demonstrated ex-
trusive rocks were reset by thermal effects from nearby
intrusive rocks. Several additional factors must be con-
sidered concerning the dates presented by Anderson
and others (1972). The lower part of the section was
never dated by them, even in Rainbow Gardens, and
they still considered it to be possibly Cretaceous in age.
Also, saline minerals present throughout the Horse
Spring Formation suggest that the associated ground
water was capable of altering volcanic rocks' and of
subsequently chemically adjusting the apparent K-Ar
ages. In addition, the ages reported by Anderson and
others (1972) were grouped and referred to in terms of
the confusing system of stratigraphic nomenclature in
existence at the time and they, therefore, must be
reevaluated in the light of newly documented strati-
graphic relations.
Twenty-five fission-track age determinations were
made on zircon extracted from basal tuff beds inter-
preted to be of air-fall origin interbedded with the other
Tertiary sedimentary rocks. The fission-track dating
method was chosen for several reasons: zircon is pres-
ent, is not susceptible to alteration, and has a high
resistance to track annealing upon heating. Also,
fission-track dating of zircon, which is rich in uranium,
works especially well in Tertiary rocks. The age-
determination procedure follows that of Naeser (1976),
and lab work was done in Naeser's lab under his
guidance.
Two important assumptions must be made when eval-
uating fission-track age determinations as primary
ages. It must be assumed that the dated rock has not
endured a heating event later than its original forma-
tion, or that it has not undergone a prolonged cooling
history. Also, it must be assumed that the dated grains
are not detrital and have had the same thermal history
as the encompassing rock. The inferred airfall origin
and the limited stratigraphic thickness of the dated
tuffs suggest that they have not undergone a slow cool-
ing history, and their mineralogy indicates that they
have not been postdepositionally heated beyond the
annealing temperature of zircon. Naeser iwritten com-
munication, 1978) has demonstrated that the approx-
imate annealing temperature of zircon through geologic
time is about 175-200 C, The presence of both heu-
landite' and analcime in the dated tuffs suggests that
most widespread, and the stromatolitic mound sub-
facies, which apparently occurs only in the upper one-
fourth of the member in Lovell Wash. A conglomeratic
lithofacies, also exposed in Lovell Wash, is the southern
stratigraphic equivalent of the stromatolitic mound
subfacies, and it is distributed near large faults. Near
Lava Butte the Bitter Ridge consists of sandstone and
intraformational breccia, which are grouped with the
conglomerate as the clastic lithofacies.
Both subfacies of the stromatolitic limestone appear
to have originated as sediment in a lacustrine environ-
ment. The tabular nature of the member; the parallel,
continuous bedding; and the fine, uniform laminations
of the wavy-bedded subfacies support the lacustrine
origin. A lacustrine environment provides the even,
widespread surface necessary to develop such bedding,
whereas few other nonmarine environments could. Ap-
parently the lake was relatively free of detrital influx,
because the limestone contains only widely dispersed
grains of siliceous clastic material and no sand-sized
Ammonia Tanks near the apex of the Timber Mountain
resurgent dome (fig. 18). The pipes are localized along the
faulted margin of a northwest-trending central graben,
described by Carr and Quinlivan (1968, p. 105). The
central parts of the pipes are light gray and devitrified,
whereas the border zones are generally glassy or finely
spherulitic. In a few places a crystallized transitional
border zone as much as 15 m (50 ft) wide contains
alternating bands of rhyolite having different phenocryst
contents and probably represents a zone of intermixed
intrusive high-silica rhyolite and remobilized quartz latite
wallrock of the Ammonia Tanks Member. The modal
range of three specimens and the silica content of 76.8
percent approach the composition of a typical high-silica
rhyolite of the Ammonia Tanks Member (fig. 21).
The inferred relations among the Ammonia Tanks
Member in the Timber Mountain resurgent dome, the
petrologically related intrusives, and an inferred under-
lying compositionally zoned magma chamber are shown
in figure 22. The two-layer compositional zoning of the
upper part of a large magma chamber is based on models
suggested by Quinlivan and Lipman (1965), by Lipman.
Christiansen, and O'Connor (1966), and by Smith and
Bailey (1966). The inward-dipping tuff dikes formed from
high-silica rhyolite magma near the apical part of the
magma chamber and are somewhat analogous to cone
sheets (Anderson, 1936). The rhyolite intrusives of East

INTRODUCTION
Detailed knowledge of the pattern of intraplate stress pro-
vides important constraints on models of global tectonic proc-
esses and the mechanism of plate motions. On a finer scale,
both the pattern of stress and variations in the pattern must be
known to understand intraplate volcanism and tectonism
properly. In addition, in regions of relative tectonic quies-
cence, knowledge of the in situ stress field is required for de-
lineation of potential seismic hazards associated with pre-
existing zones of weakness in the crust.
This study represents an attempt to map the modern stress
field (primarily Quaternary in the western United States and
Tertiary and younger in the East) in the conterminous United
States. Principal stress orientations have been determined
from geologic observations, earthquake focal mechanisms,
and in situ stress measurements. An attempt has also been
made to categorize broad regions not only by the orientations
of the principal stresses but also by their relative magnitudes,
aS inferred from currently active tectonism.
Data are presented in terms of the orientation and relative
magnitude of maximum and minimum horizontal stresses and
a vertical stress. We have assumed that one principal stress is
vertical, and the horizontal components of the in situ stress
field represent principal stresses. Evidence supporting this as-
sumption includes observations of the nearly vertical attitude
of dikes exposed over significant depth intervals at a given lo-
cality [R. B. Johnson, 1961] as well as the absence of exposed
dikes that appear not to have been emplaced vertically (D.
Pollard, oral communication, 1980). In addition, measure-
ments of the complete stress tensor in deep mines [McGarr
and Gay, 1978] and the near-borizontal orientations of the
great majority of stress axes inferred from earthquake focal
mechanisms also indicate that regionally the principal stresses
are horizontal and vertical.
The major contribution of the present study is the inclusion
of new geologic data on the orientation of the stress field,
largely in the western United States. In addition, we have at-
tempted to go back to the original references and check the re-
liability of previously compiled data, particularly for focal
mechanisms. We have excluded poorly constrained points and
have relied, whenever possible, on averages of a number of so-

heater approximating an ideal line source is placed
along the longitudinal axis of a 5.1-cm-dia, by
10.2-cm-long sample. A thermocouple is attached and
soldered to the heater at midsample. The entire probe
assembly is 'potted'' in place with a mixture of ceram-
ic cement and powdered copper to minimize and
standardize contact resistance between probe and
sample. Disks of low-conductivity ceramic insulator
are used to minimize heat loss from the ends of the
sample. Such heat losses, if unchecked, would lead to
anomalously high apparent conductivities. The over-
all internal heater length, 13.4 cm, gives a heater
length-to-diameter (L/D) ratio of 36. The L/D ratio
within the sample itself is 32. The sample-probe as-
sembly is separated from the confining fluid by a
teflon sleeve.
Power, in the form of carefully monitored and
controlled voltage and current, is applied to the probe
heater for periods of 2 min, while the exterior of the
sample is maintained at constant pressure and nearly
constant temperature (T c1%C). Because the exteri-
or temperature of the sample does not change signifi-
cantly during the period of the test, a sample of finite
dimension behaves as if it were inifinite in volume.
Thermal conductivity for the material is calculat-
ed from the internal heater temperature history and

gORPHOMETRIC STUDIES OF FRESH CINDER CONES
Cinder cone dimensions have been studied systematically only in the last
years. In this paper the terminology of Porter (1972) is used, with W,,
Hone basal diameter; W, ** crater diameter; H, cone height;s * cone slope
ingle (Fig. 2). The depth of a crater can be readily modified during or after
n eruption (at Paricutin the depth changed from 140 m to 30 m to 100 m
over a 28-day period in late 1946; Wilcox, 1947) and often is less than the
eontour interval of maps used for measurement; therefore, the depth of the
grater is not used as a descriptive parameter. In order to relate cinder cone
hhorphology to eruption conditions,I use only relatively fresh cones in the
statistical comparisons. Fresh cones are generally distinguished by a lack of
vegetation and gullying on their flanks, have well-defined circular outlines,
gnd frequently an abrupt change in slope occurs where the cone meets the
surrounding ground surface.

Cone diameter distribution
The distribution of basal diameters (W,,) for 910 cinder cones in the fol-
$$owing areas: San Francisco volcanic field, Arizona; Mauna Kea, Hawaii;
Nunivak Island, Alaska; Kilimanjaro, Tanzania; Etna, Italy; and Paricutin,
Mexico is shown in Fig. 3, compiled from data supplied by Settle (1979,
And personal communication ). Although both degraded and fresh cones are
fhcluded in this sample, the results are considered reasonably representative
of the diameter spectrum of terrestrial cinder cones. Cinder cone diameters
rnge from 0.25 km to about 2.5 km with a mean of about 0.9 km and a me-
dian of 0.8 km. By contrast, the few spatter cones whose diameters are re-
9orted in the literature are generally less than 0.l km across at their bases.
Maars are somewhat larger than cinder cones, with W;, averaging 0.7-0.8 km
(Wood, in preparation), and composite (strato-) volcanoes are much larger,
with basal diameters averaging 8 km (Wood, 1978).
,With a basal diameter of 0.13 km, the Reunion cone Cratere Ducrot is
naller than all of the 910 cones in Fig. 3. The small diameter is consistent
ith the interpretation that the Reunion cones are more like spatter cones
tan cinder cones. The other three cones discussed in the previous section

FULL-WAVE ACOUSTIC LOG
The log on the left of Figure 1 illustrates one of the more recent geophysical
logs to be offered by the commercial logging companies. It is a full-wave
acoustic log. The log shown is a Birdwell log which this company offers under
the commercial name 3-D (Bird, 1965). In essence it is a recording of the
sonic wave train for a period of time displayed as a variable intensity record-
ing, Whereas the sonic log shown in Figure 1 is essentially a recording of the
time of first arrival of a sonic pulse through the rock at some fixed sender-to-
receiver distance (which is displayed as the time through the rock divided by
the distance of travel or the reciprocal velocity), the 3-D log is a record of
the wave train for some time after the first arrival. The dynamic elastic moduli
of the medium can be calculated from this log when used in conjunction with
a density log. These moduli are Young's modulus, shear modulus, bulk mod-
ulus, and Poisson's ratio.
The full-wave recording logs offer the first opportunity to obtain dynamic
elastic moduli on a sufficiently small scale to allow comparisons to be made
with core data. Such comparisons indicate that significant relationships exist
among the acoustic properties of volcanic rocks.

Fuoride showed essentially no variation from March
through June, and so analysis for fluoride was even-
tually discontinued.
A few samples were also analyzed for cations using
a Spectrospan III A DC argon plasma spectrophoto-
meter (table 21). The values are tentative because a
rigorous determination of cross interferences has not
been completed.
DISCUSSION
CHANGES IN SULFUR AND CHLORIDE
The S:Cl ratio increased steadily during the numer-
ous small ash eruptions from March 28 to May 18
(fig. 146). From May 18 on, only ash from the major
eruptions (May 18, May 25, June 12, July 22, and
August 7) was analyzed. These later samples showed
no consistent pattern. This contrasts with data for
Fuego Volcano, Guatemala, where S:Cl ratios cor-
relate with intensity of eruption (Rose, 1977),
Amounts of leachable SO, and Cl on the ash varied
greatly even for products of a single eruption,
although sulfate concentrations remained approxi-
mately 2 times that of chloride, prior to May 18 (also
noted by Rose (1977) Hor Fuego Volcano). Variation
of S:Cl was greater after May 18, as shown by the
May 18 and June 12 samples. Samples of the ash
erupted on June 12, collected in Vancouver, Wash.
(S:C1=0.13), are distinctly different from samples col-
lected on the flanks of Mount St. Helens (S:C1= 1.18
and 0.89). The analytical procedures cannot account
for the large spread in the data. The variations are
possibly due to changes in gas composition during
eruption, meteorologic conditions, or variations in
chemical and physical processes of the eruption.
Data presented by Rose (1977) and Noguchi and
Kamiya (1963) showed a significant increase in S:CI
before a major eruption and a significant decrease
after a major eruption (or series of eruptions).
AIthough a gradual increase occurred before the
May 18 eruption, it was smaller than expected, prob-
ably because magma had already risen in the volcano
and was emitting magmatic gases before the earliest
sampled ash eruptions. Likewise, no significant
decrease has been seen in S:Cl between May 18 and
August 7. The patterns of gas ratios observed
elsewhere suggest that more eruptions are possible
until the S:Cl ratio decreases.

column collapse or expansion from the base of a ris-
ing column, At Mount St. Helens, the ''classic-surge''
environment was merely a transient waning phase
trailing the violent frontal part of the pyroclastic den-
sity flow.
The pyroclastic density flow at Mount St. Helens
was similar to classic surges in its relatively low den-
sity and its capacity to flow over ridges with only
modest regard for topography. This event differs
from classic surges in its size: the potential energy of
the flow as it began its descent off the mountain was
much greater than that of previously described
surges, and accordingly the maximum grain size and
other sedimentologic parameters of its deposits repre-
sent higher energy states than ever before observed
for analogous processes.

250 km east of Mount St. Helens, to the western
border of Idaho and to some undetermined distance
beyond, the ash blanket consists of unit 1 and the
thicker unit 3. Farther downwind, in western Mon-
tana, only a single light-gray layer was deposited. The
basal unit may have pinched out or, more likely, the
two layers have merged owing to mixing downwind.
The pronounced distal thickening of ash in the
vicinity of Ritzville, Wash. (figs. 336, 339), is caused
by the thickening of unit 3. Unit 1 also may have a
distal thickness maximum between 400 and 500 km
downwind along the lobe axis. This distal thickening
of unit 1 may correlate with a high in bulk density
and mean-grain diameter (fig. 339) at about the same
distance.
The dark ash (unit 1) began to fall considerably
before the light-colored ash (unit 3). At Spokane,
Wash., the advancing ash cloud became visible about
1400, ash started falling about 1543, and daylight was
noticeably obscured about 1545 (Paul Weis, written
commun., 1980). Satellite photographs, however, in-
dicate that the ash front passed over Spokane about
2 hr before the cloud was visible to the ground
observer, except for a sun halo that appeared about
1215. This time difference suggests that the front of
the ash cloud was diffuse. Similarly, dark ash fell at
Pullman, Wash., from about 1400 until about 1615.
when light-colored ash began to fall. The light-
colored ash continued to fall until about 0200 on May
19 (Hooper and others, 1980). On the north-south
traverse through Moscow, Idaho, the axis of the dark
layer is about 40 km south of the axis of the light-
colored layer (fig. 340); this difference suggests that
deposition for each layer occurred under somewhat
different wind conditions. At Missoula, Mont., ash
fall began about 2000-2030, some 3l to 3i hr after the
front passed, but near the north end of the traverse,
ash fall began between 2100 and 2200, about 3] to 4]
hr after the front passed. Both in eastern Washington
and in western Montana, 2 hr or more elapsed bet-
ween the passage of the ash-cloud front and the start
of ash fall on the ground. The delay was greater on
the north side of the plume than on the south side.
We compared the isochron map, which shows the
approximate shape and areal dimensions of the
airborne-ash plume, with the isomass map, which
shows the minimum areal and mass distribution of
the ash on the ground (fig. 341). The ash lobe on the
ground is offset to the north relative to the position of
the airborne plume. This northward shift of the air-
Fall lobe relative to the position of the airborne plume
is a result of different wind directions with altitude.
Much of the ash deposited from central Washington
to western Montana was probably carried in the high-
velocity (60-125 km/hr) wind layer at altitudes of
about 10-13 km (fig. 335). This layer was transpor-
ting ash towards azimuths 093%-101' (1020 PDT at
Spokane according to U.S. National Meteorological
Service). By 1600, these high-velocity winds had
shifted northeastward, toward azimuths 079-087%
(fig. 335). This shift in wind direction apparently is
the cause of the axis of the earlier, dark ash being off-
set to the south of the axis of the later, light-colored
ash (fig. 340). During late morning and afternoon of
May 18, however, the slower low-level wind was
consistently more northeastward than was the high-
level wind. At Spokane, velocities of low-level winds
at altitudes 2,250-5.300 m were 30-60 km/hr. At
1020 they were toward azimuth 005%-070%, and at
1600 toward azimuth 048%-070?, These vectors
10%-90 north of the high-level wind vectors explain
why the ash fell on the ground north of the observed
airborne-ash plume.

vergence rate and accelerated absolute North American plate motion
toward the western trench. The trend of the western North American
plate margin relative to the absolute motion of the plate also may have
affected the subsequent igneous and tectonic history along the Cordillera.
Palinspastic restorations of western United States at the beginning of the
Cenozoic by Hamilton and MIyers (1966), Hamilton (1969), and .rm-
strong and Suppe (1973) account for variable amounts of Late Cenozoic
extension in the Basin and Range province. The effect of these restora-
tions (fig. 9) is that the continental margin between the latitude of Las
Vegas and the California-Oregon border trends approximately north-
south. To the north, along Oregon and Washington, the continental
margin trends north by northeast. To the south, thhe trend of the con-
tinental margin is to the southeast, and the margin again chhanges to a
north by northwest direction along Mexico (Karig and [ensky, 1972).
Eastward shift in loci of Early Cenozoic magmatic centers is gradual
along the British Columbia to Wyoming arc trend and is most pro-
nounced in the central Rocky Mountains of Colorado (fig. 3). The
Colorado locus is directly east of the north-south trending California
margin and is northeast of the southeast trending southern California
margin (fig. 9). From the subduction model, we would predict that the
Further circumstantial evidence for the volcanic vcnting of granitic magma
chambers comes from interpretations of the large collapse calderas that form
around the feeder systems for many rhyolitic ash-flow or ignimbrite sheets
[Smith, 1960]. The calderas at the suriace may be linked directly to cauldron-
subsidence structures beneathh, hence some associatcd ring-dike complexcs muy
fill roughly concentric arrays of reluated fault fissures, and the rhyolitic ignim-
brite eruptions may signal partial evacuation of subjaccnt granitic 1magma cham-
bers having the dimensions of stocks and small batholiths. Ilamilton [ 1969a, b]
notes that the Andean ignimbrites arc typically more silicic than most major
batholiths, as would be expected if the uppper levels of a differentiating magma
body were lost by eruption through vents in the roof. He infers that an elongate
granitie batholith belt of Cenozoic age probably lies unexposed at modest depths
beneath the curvilinear volcanic field of rhyolitic and andesitic extrusives along
the crest of the Andes. A Crctaccous analog may be prescnt in Japan, where
granitie intrusives and rhyolitic extrusives of roughhly the sam)e ages are widely
exposed in the same broad region of western Honshu [Miyashiro, 1967, pp. CC2-
423; Ichikawa et al., 1968].
ORIGINS OF ANDESITIC ROC KS
Theories for the origin of andesitic magmas fall into thrce muin cntegories:
1. Primary mantle melts or derivative melts formed by differentiation of
primary basaltie mantle melts
2. Primary crustal melts or derivative melts formed by crustal contamina-
tion of primary basaltic mantle melts
3. Melts, or their derivativcs, formed from either the crustal or the mantle
parts of lithosphere descending along inclined seismic zones
Either the first two or the last two could conceivably opcrate in conjunc-
tion, as rising magmas react with rocks at shallower levels and introduce heat
nto shallower regions.
Derivation From Mantle Parents or Melts
Presently permissible variants of the first type of theory are unacceptably
iiverse. Possible sequences of melting and crystallization within the mantle at
iifferent pressure levels are complex, and varied alternate gcochemical frac-
ionation patterns of crystal residua or accumulates and liquid residua or dif-
erentiates are conceivable [O'Hara, 1965]. The geochemical properties of a
nantle-derived lava that reaches the surface reflect conditions of temperature
und pressure at the highest level of equilibration between melt and some refrac-
ory or accumulative crystalline residuum that remains at depth. Even if the
:rupted lava is primitive in the sense that it has not undergone contamination
xr differentiation at crustal levels, its composition does not necessarily resemble
:losely that of the liquid that formed at the site of initial fusion deep in the
nantle. To a first approximation, the changes that the magma undergoes during
ts rise through the mantle are masked fromm our direct view, as it were, by the
place at a relatively high strain rate and locally produced strong stratal rota-
tions and closely spaced normal faults, the faults themselves being rotated to
relatively low dips. In those areas where extreme regional erosion, coupled
with continuous isostatic rise, has been at play for 5 to 10 m.y. (as in the
Sonoran Desert section), these structures (as noted above) are found to termi-
nate downward at large-scale, subhorizontal detachment surfaces or zones of
extreme cataclasis and/or ductile shear, some of which developed prior to the
onset of extension (Compton et al 1977, Coney 1979, Davis &Coney 1979,
Davis et al 1979, Rehrig et al 1980). While the ductile flow of these rocks in
some places clearly predated the initiation of extension, temperatures during
the extensional episode were sufficiently high to reset radiometric clocks and,
in other places, apparently remained high from the time of compression to the
time of extension.
Role and Origin of Large-Scale Detachment Surfaces
Initiation and maintenance of horizontal shear at the level of such detachments
probably stemmed from increased shear stress, owing to reduction in lateral
support in the shallow crust--the result of thermal expansion, uplift (and the
related increase in surface area that such uplift brings because of a local,
incremental increase in earth radius), and lithospheric extension at depth. It
was further served by a lowered shear strength, stemming from (a ) the pres-
ence of zones of strong anisotrophy, inhomogeneity, and stress concentration
that were created by earlier episodes of compressional thrusting and decol-
lement, as well as by mechanical layering, particularly the presence of ductile
layers within, at the base of, and below the sedimentary pile that thins against
the massive buttress of the North American craton to the east; and (b) high
pore pressure at the base of the brittle faulted column, its presence reflected
in a compressional wave velocity inversion and elevated electrical conduc-
tivity (Eaton 1980). At deeper levels, beneath the reheated mylonites or
metamorphic rocks that underlie the normal faults (and across which a strong,
shear stress gradient existed), extension is believed to have taken place by
inhomogeneously distributed, uniform flow, the result of thermal pre-
weakening of the lithosphere by repeated magmatic invasion. Known zones of
inherited compressional decollement originated in pre-Tertiary time and early
Tertiary time, but crustal temperatures high enough for extensional flow at
natural strain rates, even at shallow lithospheric levels, apparently were main-
tained from the time of compression until at least mid-Cenozoic time when
brittle extension, basaltic volcanism, regional uplift, and, locally, erosion and
rapid cooling began.
Rheological Considerations

and one of possible remobilized uniform flow by steady-state creep at depth,

When outdoors in the winter, one becomes
well aware of the chilling effects of wind. When
the temperature is at freezing (32*F). a 25 mile
per hour wind has a chilling effect equivalent to
zero temperature. When the temperature is zero,
a 10 mile per hour wind has a chilling effect
equivalent to -22'F, and a 25 mile per hour wind
has a chilling effect equivalent to --45*F. Wind
chill below --32*F causes freezing of exposed
human flesh, depending on one's circulation and
physical activity. With wind chill temperatures
much below that, survival efforts may be re-
quired. As long as the temperature is above 10'F,
only gales are dangerous. When the temperature
is zero, there is danger of flesh becoming frozen
if exposed to a 15 mile per hour wind. When the
temperature is -15'F a wind velocity of 10 miles
per hour can be dangerous. At temperatures
much below that, it is probably best to remain
indoors by the fireside.
Climatic differences between the Atlantic and
Pacific coasts illustrate the effect of wind. Be-
cause of the prevailing westerly winds, the Pa-
cific Coast has a marine climate with cool sum-
mers and mild winters, while the Atlantic coast
has a continental climate with hot summers and
cold winters. Hawaii and Puerto Rico are in trop-
ical latitudes, but are cooled by the northeast
trade winds,
Violent Weather and
Other Climatic Hazards
Every part of the continent is subject to occa-
sional combinations of conditions that produce
extreme weather, The result may be a record-
breaking hot or cold spell, a drenching downpour
and Pliocene time that cut off the headwaters of
the Little Colorado River (see p. 458).
The faulting that outlined the mountain ranges
and basins apparently began in early or middle
Tertiary time, as it did in the Great Basin. There
was faulting before the deposition of the Santa
Fe and other late Tertiary formations along the
Rio Grande, but these formations were involved
in later movements along the faults (Fig. 16.10.A).
Some volcanism occurred about this time also.
The faulting here seems to have ceased earlier
than it did in the Salton Trough, Mojave Desert,
and Great Basin, as is suggested by the integra-
tion of the drainage and the scarcity of fresh fault
scarps. However, the belt of earthquake epi-
centers that extends northward along the Rio
Grande Valley (Fig. 2.17) suggests that earth
movement is still going on.
Along its northern boundary, the Mexican
Highland Section grades into the Colorado Pla-
teau, both structurally and topographically. In
New Mexico, the northern part of the Highland
is a block-faulted lava plateau that grades north-
ward into the lava-covered Datil Section of the
Colorado Plateau. The relationship is very simi-
lar to that along the northern edge of the Great
Basin, where block-faulted lavas grade north-
ward into the lava-capped plateaus there.
In Arizona, the northern boundary of the
Highland is a dissected escarpment of Precam-
brian rocks capped by Paleozoic formations and
Tertiary lavas, The escarpment is several thou-
sand feet high, faces south, and extends 500 miles
from the Colorado River to the Rio Grande Val-
ley. The escarpment has acted as a structural
hinge along which the country lying to the south
has alternately been bent upward and downward
relative to the country to the north. The country
south of the escarpment was structurally lower
than the country to the north during Early Creta-
ceous time. It was higher during late Cretaceous
times and again during early and middle Tertiary
time, when gravels were shed northward onto the
Colorado Plateau. Today it is lower (Fig. 16.11).

North of the Yukon Basin is the Brooks Range,
which reaches altitudes of more than 8,000 feet
at its eastern extreme near the Mackenzie River

tude in the west, where it marks the boundary
between a Mesozoic miogeosyncline on the north
and a geanticline on the south. The Mesozoic
formations thicken greatly northward from the
mountains to the coast. Uplift of these old rocks
formed the Brooks Range during Tertiary and
Ouaternary time. This uplift is separated from
that at the Seward Peninsula by the Ouaternary
Selawik Basin.

Both areas of eugeosynclinal rocks were visited
by us in the spring of 1966. A brief reconnaissance
of the Garlock Formation had been made previously
by Ketner, using Dibblee's (1952) map and litho-
logic data. The rocks in Pilot Knob Valley had been
noted during earlier reconnaissance mapping by
Smith (in Jennings, Burnett, and Troxel, 1962). A
striking similarity between the two statigraphic
sections was evident, and subsequent work was
aimed at testing the degree of similarity. Data on
the Garlock Formation presented here are chiefly
from the reports by Dibbiee (1952, p. 15-19; 1967,
p. 27-28 and 34-85) and Christiansen (1961), sup-
plemented by results of the short inspection
described above and a few iater visits for study of
specific rock units. ilata on the metasedimentary
rocks in Pilot Knob 'alley presented in this paper
were collected by Smith during 6 days' additional
geologic fieldwork and suioseouent study of about 40
specimens in the laboratory.
The metasedimentary rocks in Pilot Knob Valley
crop out 2 to 8 miies south of the Garlock fault as
isolated smail hills, .50 to 400 feet high, that pro)
ect through the alluvium. Because the outcrops lie
within a U.S. Navy testing range, fieldwork was
minimal and had to be done on weekends, some-
times with a military escort. The work consisted of
delineating the extent of metasedimentary rocks
and traversing the best-exposed sections. On eachh
traverse, the planimetric width of each separable
lithologic unit was measured by pace, and the pace
distance and lithologic description of each recorded
on a portable tape recorder to be transcribed later.
The traverses totaled about 16,000 feet. The pace
distances were obviously approximate, and most
rock descriptions are based only on criteria that
could be applied in the field. The measured trav-
erses described in table 1 and shown on figure 3 are
not stratigraphic sections in the conventional sense.
Not enough time was available to make reliable geo-
logic maps of the areas composed of these rocks;
and the many faults and small-scale folds observed
along the traverse lines, though not shown on figure

confidence one could have in stratigraphic sections
made without geologic maps. Furthermore, the

This report-Major Tar Sand and Heavy Oil
Deposits of the United States-addresses four
irmportant national energy resource objectives:
(1) to develop an updated assessment of U.S.
tar sand resources;(2)to independently appraise
the major tar sand deposits having 10O million
or more barrels in-place;(3)to document, using
previously published data, the minor tar sand
deposits, with between 1C and 10O million barrels
in-place; and,(4)to tabulate the nation's heavy
oil deposits.
BACKGROUND
The need for this report has grown with each
passing year since the last ''official'' tabulation
of UU.S. tar sands, the 1965 Department of Inter-
ior/Bureau of Mines Monograph 12 entitled,
Surfaceand Shallou Oil-lmpregnated Rocks of the
LUnited States, That reportwas conducted under
the auspices of the Interstate Oil Compact Com-
mission as was this report.
Much has changed in the domestic energy
picture in the intervening twenty years since the
publishing of Monograph 12. Allofthese changes
have added importance to better understanding
and developing,(where economically feasible),
the large and valuable hydrocarbon resources
locked in U.S. tar sand deposits, It is the hope
of the staff, reviewers, and directors of this
study that this collection of information will
help industrial and public managers make more
judicious and timely decisions about the domestic
tar sand and heavy oil resources.
MAJOR FINDINGS
The four major findings of this study are:
1. The Total U.S. Tar Sand Resource is
Estimated at 54 Billion Barrels. The measured
U.S. tar sand resource in-place for major deposits
isestimated at 22 billion barrels. The speculative
resource in-place for major deposits is estimated
at 31 billion barrels. The minor deposits contain
1.0billion barrels of speculative tar sand resource
in-place. Not addressed by this study is the
offshore California area where tar sand/heavy
oil deposits are presumed to exist, but for which
data are not yet obtainable.
The tar sand resource estimate for the U.S. is
shown by state on Figure l (see page 2) and on
the following table. The distribution of tar sand
by state and resource category is shown on
Figure 2 (see page s).
tar sand resource is 11.9 billion barrels,
and the speculative resource is S.2 billion
barrels.
The tar sand resource estimate for California
is 4,7 billion barrels; expansions in the
size of previously identified deposits, the
identification of new deposits, and the
attractive properties of the tar sand reservoirs
should make California an important center
for tar sand development.
The tar sand resource in Texas is estimated
at 4.S billion barrels due to the recognition
and improved definition of three large
deposits-the San Miguel D, the Anacacho
and the Hensel formations.
The Kentucky tar sand resource in-place
isestirmated at 1.T billion barrels measured,
plus an additional 1.7 billion barrels spe-
culative, up from the previous estimate of
less than 50 million barrels.
Alabama is estimated to have 6.5 billion
barrels of tar sand in-place, mainly in one
large deposit, the Hartselle sandstone of
northern Alabama.
A major new tar sand/heavy oil area,con-
tainingabout 10 billion barrels of speculative
resource in-place, has been identified on
the North Slope of Alaska, overlying the
Kuparuk River oil field.
Ouer 1,100 Heavy Oil Deposits Have
Been Identified and Tabulated; They Constitute
an Important, Only Partly Developed National
Resource. Reservoir properties and production
histories were identified (from publicly available
data)for 1,10O heavy oil fields and reservoirs in
the U.S. (Heavy oil fields are defined as deposits
havingan oil gravitybetween 10'APIannd 20'API).
The majority of the heavy oil reservoirs and
fields are in California, with 356deposuts, fexas,
with 350 deposits, and Arkansas, with 120
deposits.
Heavy oil deposits constiture ar important
and challenging UU.S. resource target that require

per year, and evaporation from the reservoir is
estimated at 70 in. (1,780 mm) per year (F. P. Kipple,
written commun., 1975).
When the study began (October 1962) nearly 70
percent of the vegetation on the flood plain was
saltcedar (Tamarix: chinensis)1, with the remaining
vegetation consisting of mesquite (Prosopis), willow
GSalix), cottonwood (Populus), seepwillow (Baccharis),
and seepweed (Suaeda). Vegetation was removed from
the flood plain in segments of several acres at different
periods during 1967-71. Virtually all the study area
was cleared of vegetation by March 1971.

In most places the gypsum in the nodules is massive
and earthy, but locally they consist of sggregates of
diamond-shaped crystals or fibers (fig. 22). At any
given locality the crystal form of the gypsum sppears
to be uniform, but the forms differ from one locality to
another. These crystal forms may be an epbemeral
feature subject to seasonal change and may reflect the
presence of impurities or seasonal differences in pbysical
environment, such as degree and rate of recent wetting
or drying. The hemibydrate, bassanite although com-
mon in the chloride layer at the surface, was not
observed in this buried layer of nodules where there is
little sodium chloride.
The nodules contain traces of borates and nitrates;
no nitrates were detected in the salt crust.
Below the sulfate layer is the carbonate layer of silty
sand, containing tiny delicate crystals of acutely ter-
minated calcite as illustrated on figure 23. This
calcite is abundant, but comprises only a fraction of a
percent of the deposit. The high proportion of calcium
and carbonate in the deposit (see for example, S136a,
table 31) is due chiefly to the clastic limestone and
dolomite. The acutely terminated calcite is the cbar-
acteristic mineral of the carbonate zone, but by no
mesns is it the dominant one. It is in fact a minor one.
Its deposition possibly is facilitated by the organic

source of petroleum hydrocarbons, a possibility
that has been demonstrated by laboratory experi-
ments. As slow as the process of conversion of
organic material to hydrocarbons is, '%C studies in-
dicate that the process can occur in less than 10,000
years.
The higher forms of life that grow and live on the
land are unimportant, but the lower planktonic or-
ganisms, such as diatoms and algae, that thrive
abundantly near the surface of the sea, are now
considered the most probable and important source
materials. Some geologists think that the differ-
ences in oils may be due to differences in source
material, but this seems quite unimportant, since
the complicated processes that follow could yield
vastly greater differences.
The organic remains accumulate in the bottom
muds of lagoons or in depressions on the floor of
shallow seas and there become incorporated in ac-
cumulating sediments. Trask has tested thousands
of bottom mud samples and has found the organic
content to be fairly constant for about 160 kilome-
ters offshore and to range from 0.3 percent in deep
sea oozes to 7 percent off the coast of California.

named, and formally accepted stratigraphic
units that might have an economic potential in
this industry. Lithologically, these break down
into quartz-mica schists, quartzites, sandstones
(variable in degree of consolidation ), quartz
conglomerates. quartz gravels, and several
widely separated tripoli districts. Also included
were many geologically undesignated dune sand
occurrences, terrace sands and gravels, com-
mercial chert deposits, massive quartz pegma-
tites, hydrothermal replacement bodies and
silicified zones, some of which have been and
probably are viable from an economic point
of view.
In this connection there are many scattered,
very pure, silica sand deposits of Holocene age
along the coastal plains of South Carolina.
Georgia, and Florida, some of which have been
and are being reworked by wind and the present
rtver systems. Another interesting and valuable
source type may be referred to as the St.
Lucte soil zone which is well-developed along
a stretch of east Florida coast particularly
un St, Luce county (Hudson, 1946), the type
locality, as well as inland in this state and in
south Georgia (Teas, 1921). The key to the
purity of these deposits relates to a fluctuating
ground water table and an excess of azohumic
and other organic acids resulting from decaying
swamp vegetation which leaches the iron nor-
mally present in the surficial sand. This organic
chemistry develops the so-called Van Dyke or
sap-brown ore at the base of the leached zone
which was much sought after as an organic dye
for paint, wood stains, and inks before the ad-
vent of aniline dyes. Most of these types of
deposits are from 4 to possibly 12 ft thick on
flat terrain with consequent disappointingly low
tonnages. However, they are commercially
viable at a few points in each of the states men-
tioned and can supply local flint glass sand
markets for indeterminant periods of time if
extensive enough, which several have proved to
be. The inevitable silica sand rings which par-
tially surround the puzzling ''Carolina Bays,''
are believed to be a manifestation of this leach-
ng and in one instance were commercially ex-
ploited for several years in Williamsburg
County, South Carolina (Buie, 1958).
Two formational units for high grade ceramic
products exposed in the eastern and a few
middle western states warrant detailed citation
as the most successfully exploited silica raw
material sources on the basis of tonnage and
profit in this country. They are the St. Peter
sandstone together with its stratigraphic equivr
lents of Lower Ordovician age, and the Orl
kany sandstone or orthoquartzite of Lower
Devonian age. The St. Peter is exposed and
exploited principally in northern Illinois.and,
to a lesser degree, in southern Wisconsin and
Missouri. Sandstones of the same time equiva-
lency also are exploited in Arkansas and Okla-
homa (Lamar, 1927; Ham, 1945). These for-
rmations are relatively flat-lying and massively
bedded materials of weak to moderate consoli-
dation that lend themselves equally well to
open pit or underground mining recovery, both
methods being currently employed. Physical
recovery is high and a minimum of plant
preparation is necessary because of its extreme
natural purity. Reserves are large and nearly

ship will soon be, if it has not already been,
completely zoned out of the market by urbani-
2ation pressures.
The Oriskany quartzite, more precisely the
Ridgeley sandstone (Harris, 1972), is a ridge
maker, to a large degree, because of its greater
induration and consequent structural attitudes.
For the most part it is found in strongly
dipping beds ranging from 45' to the vertical
and even overturned. In a few areas it is as
flat-bedded as the St. Peter, whereas, locally, it
may be preserved intact in homoclinal, anti-
clinal, and synclinal postures (Bates, 1960).
Being an integral part of the Appalachian High-
lands, its economic occurrences are pretty well
limited to the tri-state area of Virginia, West
Virginia, and Pennsylvania. The texture, purity.
and degree of induration are all subject to es-
treme variability which is much less seldom
encountered with the St, Peter. However, by
and large, it shares the same perfection of grain
that the St. Peter enjoys and most of the defects
are secondarily induced and can be mitigated
and often nearly eliminated by suitable plant
beneficiation. Here again, all known reserves
in the technical sense and much that could be
classed as potential resource acreage is believed
to be owned by, or under long-term lease t4

tion of what is already controlled will doubtke4
never be completely exploited because of th
ever-increasing zonal restrictions due to urbant-
2zation.

R0P-70% E., transverse to the altered zone. Fluorite is erratically dis.
ttpihuted in the veins, and the content ranges from a trace to as much as

sUGGESTIONS FOR EXPLORATION OF FLUORITE DEPOSITS
The best commereial fluorite deposits are more likely to oceur in a lime-
stone host than in a voleanie one.
The deposits in altered voleanie rocks probably are too low in grade
to support large-scale mining under 1969 priees, and veins rich enough
to warrant selective mining are small. However, richer replacement
bodies in Paleozoic limestone may have formed beneath the voleanie
eover approximately coineident with the extensive altered zones of areas
5 through 8 and along the northwest alinement of the zones. This depth
may approximate 1,000 feet in areas 5 and 6.
Deposits in limestone contain the best grade ore, locally 90 pereent
CaF, hy weight. In some of the deposits, fluorite completely replaees
limestone. but it rarely if ever rcplaces silicifled fragments of limestone,
quartzite, or rhyolite, Hence the grade of ore in tho silicifiel breeeias
will never be as good as that possihle in the limestone ; also, a penalty is
ineurred for silica in fluorspar ore. Howevcr, because most of the fiaorite
in the brecciated jasperized limestone coats and cements breceia frag-
Yments, the bulk of the fluorite can be recovered by crushing to halfineh
grain size and screening out the undersize, whieh contains the fluorith.
Standard flotation methods can be used to separate fluorite and silies
to produce acid-grade (97 percent CaF,) fluorspar, and since metsk
lurgieal grade spar need only have an effeetive CaF content of 60 per-
cent, the deposits in silieified breceias should not be negleeted. To
separate caleite from fluorite by flotation requires expensive heatingo

The possible importance of the deposits in limestone is supporteßh
the striking resemblance of the Hi-Grade and Mammoth deposits to ro7

in ways that numerical meth-ds cannot yet accom-
plish.
Lacking direct information from drilling, favorable
ground is defined largely by comparing available geo-
logic, geochemical, and geophysical data with those
from known and developed ore deposits. The primary
objective is to identify geologic environments favor-
qable for the occurrence of mineral resources in the
are. being assessed. Ore deposit models, especially
tho--: including interpretation of the ore-forming pro-
cesses, embodying these favorable geologic environ-
ments can be powerful tools in evaluating the resource
potential of an area. Do the observed characteristics
of the area being evaluated match the descriptive
model of an ore deposit type? Did the right sequence
of processes take place that could form ore depositsf
Genetic models are needed to flesh out incomplete
descriptive frameworks; moreover, consideration of
processes that form ore is inherent in those circum-
stances where prediction of resource potential is re-
quired. If the basic conditions of an ore deposit model
are met, other factors such as composition of host rock
or availability of structure can be used to determine
degr :s of potential more closely and to focus atten-
tion a specific areas. In any area a large number of
ore deposit models must be considered, some to be
examined closely if geologic factors are favorable,
some to be rejected if they are unfavorable.
Definitions
A high mineral resource potential is deemed to exist
where geologic, geochemical, and geophysical char-
acteristics favorable for resource accumulation are
known to be present, or where enough of these char-
acteristics are present to give strong support to genetic
models favorable for resource accumulation and
where evidence shows that mineral concentration-
mineralization in the broad sense-has taken place.
This category includes not only known mining dis-
tricts i-ut also other areas where data are adequate
to demonstrate or indicate an excellent possibility that
mineralized rock exists. Where available, data on the
4e, grade, and location of individual deposits are
Wmportant in making this assessment, but the avail-
ability of these data is not a primary requisite. Areas
ith high mineral resource potential are more closely
hdged with respect to current economic conditions
than those with lesser resource potential.
Moderate mineral resource potential exists where
@ologic, geochemical, and geophysical characteris-
tics favorable for resource accumulation are known
can reasonably be interpreted to be present but
here evidence for mineralization is less clear cut or
Mas not yet been found. A reasonable possibility for
thediseovery of valuable mineral deposits should exist
all areas rated as having moderate mineral resource
potential. Genetic models are especially valuable in
those areas with moderate potential where extrapo-
lation of subtle data may be required. Those areas
classified as having moderate potential on the basis
of sparse information could have this rating changed
to high by new and favorable information or by
changes in demand for a commodity or in economic
conditions.
Low mineral resource potential is assigned to areas
where geologic, geochemical, and geophysical char-
acteristics are unfavorable, where evidence indicates
that mineral concentrations are unlikely, or where
requirements of genetic models cannot be supported,
such as a lack of source or mechanism of accumu-
lation. This broad category embraces areas with ob-
vious but dispersed and apparently uneconomical
mineral occurrences, as well as areas with few indi-
cations of mineralization. Use of the low potential
category requires an element of positive knowledge;
it should not be a catchall for areas lacking adequate
data.
A category of unknown mineral resource potential
is necessary where the level of knowledge, at the ap-
propriate scale, is so inadequate that to classify a unit
area as high, moderate, or low in mineral resource
potential would be misleading. The size of the unit
area under consideration and the detail of informa-
tion available are key elements in deciding where this
category is best applied. Preliminary assessments of
areas requiring further study would particularly ben-
efit from such a category.
Almost all areas of the earth's crust contain mineral
commodities of at least some possible economic value
were they adequately explored and should a market
develop. It is thus deemed inadvisable to class any
area as having no mineral resource potential, although
some areas may be classed as having no potential for
a particular mineral commodity.
1Discussion
Mineral resources form in all types of geologic en-
vironments, and occurrences vary widely even within
a single general type of deposit. For completeness,
statements describing high or moderate resource po-
tential should specify commodity and mode of oc-
currence; data and logic used to reach the conclusion
should be made clear in supporting documentation.
The magnitude (tonnage, grade, value) of possible
mineral occurrences must be considered in assigning
areas to high, moderate, and low resource potential
categories; an important distinction exists between
possible large or clustered deposits, as compared with
small and isolated deposits. For example, hydrother-
mal metal concentrations range from small isolated
deposits, to clusters of small deposits, to large deposits
surrounded by halos of smaller deposits, to isolated

significant amounts of uranium. The Cottonwood zone is
associated with a uranium deposit reported to contain 13
million tons of 0.5 to 0.6 percent uranium.
Alteration minerals characterizing the sedimentary
section exposed along Cottonwood Creek, at the extreme
west end of the uranium ore deposit, are shown in Figure
13. Clinoptilolite and erionite occur sporadically through
the stratigraphic section and are more abundant in beds
of tuffaceous sandstones. Feldspar occurs throughout the
section.
Uranium occurs at several stratigraphic intervals in
the Cottonwood section. Uranium in the basal 66 ft (20 m)
of section occurs in the opaline silica-rich, thinly-laminated,
ferric hydroxide stained layers.-The uranium is closely
associated with mercury, lithium, arsenic and antimony,
strongly reflecting a common presence in the altering
hydrothermal solutions. This is strikingly shown by the
uranium and arsenic-rich calcite layer at approximately
150 ft (46 m). The variability of the elemental contents
in the lower 66 ft (20 m) is obscured by a composite
sampling in the 13 to 46 ft (4 to 14 m), ie, individual
layers and beds were sampled only in the lower and upper
parts of the interval. Above 66 ft (20 m) the elements
begin to separate. Lithium is less than 50 ppm in the
calcite layer at 150 ft (46 m) and it is inversely related to
the uranium, arsenic, and mercury content. Carbonaceous
debris is plentiful in the 92 to 121 ft (28 to 37 m) interval.
Both lithium but particularly uranium are enriched in the
121 to 138 ft (37 to 42 m) interval of organic-rich (ostracods
and carbonaceous debris) lacustrine mudstones that alter-
nate with black opaline-silica layers. A very coarse-textured
tuff grades upward into a finer air-fall tuff. The tuff is little
altered, contains the highest thorium content in the se-
quence, and is low in uranium, lithium, arsenic, and
mercury. The lacustrine sequence resumes at about 154 ft
(47 m) with an enrichment in lithium, uranium. and arsenic
in an organic-rich claystone. This sequence is interrupted
at about 150 ft (50 m) by a gray air-fall tuff indicated in
the sequence by the thin bed enriched in thorium. Above
this bed, lacustrine claystones are enriched in lithium.
arsenic, and mercury. This is the thickest interval of lithium
enrichment in the section. Above the claystones, at about
200 ft (61 m), the section becomes a very coarse textured
tuffaceous sandstone partially covered by slumping-

Whien c falls betwecn 1 and 2, the point of inflection actually occurs at a
negative value of P, and so no longer corresponds to a point on the expcri-
mental isotherm : the isotherm is then no longer of 'Type ll but has become a
clear Type lll. lf c lies between 0 and 1, the value of P at the point of
inflection is imaginary; again, the isotherm is of Type lll.
2.4 A9lication of the BET Equstion te Type li lsotherms
The form of the BET equation most often applied to experimental data is
that given in (2.37), viz.
A few representative BET plots of Type ll isotherms are given in Higs.
2.6-2.9. Those in Fig. 2.6 for nitrogen adsorption at - 193'C on various
catalysts, taken from the original paper of Brunauer, Emmett and Teller''',
are linear betwcen relative pressures of about 0-05 and 0-35. On extra-
polation they pass close to the origin (a feature which is typical of nitro-
gen adsorption on oxides and hydrated oxides) and this indicates a
srelatively large value of c, which is associated with the presence of a distinct
knee in the adsorption isotherm (p. 57). 'The isotherms and BET plots in
Fig. 2.7, obtained by Davis, DDeWitt and Emrmett''''; illustrate a c>e
where c is small (e.g. for n-C,Hl,g, c = 54 at 0' and c = I16 at -78'C)
The isotherm is much more rounded at the low pressurc end and corre-
spondingly the intercept on the p[x(pg -p)-axis is further away from the
origin; the range of linearity is roughly the same as before, however.
Contrary to what had at one time been supposed, the range of validity ol
the BET equation docs not always extend to relative pressures as high a>
0-30 or 0-35. In Fig. 2.8 and 2.9 there are examples of BET plots wluch
begin to depart from linearity when the rclative pressure excecds 01. The
plots of Fig. 2.8 are taken from the recent work of lsirikyan and K iselev''''
on graphitized carbon black. The range of relative pressures over

1he 8D of fluid inclusions of late Plio-
cene age (laminae 10B-5 through 10B-7
and 10A-5 through 10A-8) average about
-60 per mil, or about 40 per mil heavicr
than that of modern recharge (-99 per
mil) and late (7) Wisconsin age (5)
ground water (--102 per mil) discharging
today from the major artesian springs in
the region (Fig. 2). More significantly,
the &D values, in general, become pro-
gressively lighter with decreasing age
over the last 1 to 2 million years. Do
these values represent deuterium of Plio-
cene and Pleistocene ground water
trapped in the veins during the calcite
precipitation, or are they artifacts of (i)
water-mineral exchange, (ii) rcmobiliza-
tion of fluid inclusions during calcite
recrystallization, or (iii) selective diffu-
sion of 'H4O from the fluid inclusions?
We cannot attrihute the changes in deu-
terium to water-mineral exchange be-
cauuse the water-bearing frhctures in thc
regional carbonate aquifer, feeding the
modern (and fosil flow system, are
typically coated with calcite or dolomite
(8). This coating precludes the echange
of hydrogen between water and clay
minerals during flow from recharge to
discharge areas, In fet, the difference in
therefore, air tends to occupy the larger pores. The two fluids---water and
air--coexist in the soil by occupying different portions of the pore spaw
having different geometric configurations. For this reason, the soil exhiht-
toward the two fluids different conductivity or permeability functions, a-
these relate to the different effective diameters and tortuosities of the pore
sets occupied by each fluid. Only when the soil is completely permeated by
one or the other, be it water or air, should either flowing fluid encounter the
same transmission coefficient of the medium. (See the discussion of intrms.
permeability in Chapter 8.)
Notwithstanding the differences between water flow and air flow, n i-
possible to formulate the convective flow of air in the soil as an equation
analogous to Darcy's law for water flow, as follows:
where (?; and ?, are the amounts of exchange at time t and equilibrium
() respectively; ,, * concentration of tracer ion initially present, and
S, Y, and r represent the surface area, volume, and radius of the exchang-
er particles. The biggest practical problem in determining the diffusion
coefficient is the measurement of the surface area. One method involv-
ing gas adsorption and another involving a projection method have been
used to determine S (60). A better method would be one which is in-
dependent of the surface area. The effective or apparent diffusion co-
efficient, D', is related to interdiffusion of the two exchanging cations,
or interchange of cation A and B with the same valence, D, D] =DI
and is independent of the composition. The apparent diffusion coeffi-
cient varies with temperature according to the Arrhenius equation. For
zeolites, D' varies from 1 x I0'' to 1 g 10' cm' sec''. Detailed studies
of ion exchange kinetics and diffusion have been made on chabazite
(60, 61) and mordenite (62, 63) using radiochemical methods to follow
the ion exchange process. In chabazite, the narrowest apertures, about
3.9 A in diameter (Chap. 2), are large enough to permit diffusion of
most ions without squeezing. It is probable that replacement of some
of the ions found within the hexagonal prism would involve cation dif-
fusion through the 6-rings. The self-diffusion coefficients of certain ions
in chabazite follow the Arrhenius equation (see Table 7. 16). The energy
barriers associated with the self-diffusion process vary from about 7
kcal for the univalent ions to about double that value for calcium and
strontium ions. However, the energy barrier was 8.7 kcal for barium
ion, the largest of the divalent ions.
The Arrhenius equation is used to determine the activation energy, E:

believes that there are also important
advantages in providing for individual
protection in ways compatible with the
containment and assurance
requirements. In discussing this issue,
the SAB Subcommitiee stated that: ''We
support the use of a population risk
criteria. We believe it is impractical to
provide absolute protection to every
individual for all postulated events or
for very long periods. On the other hand,
in our view it is important that, for the
first several hundred years, residents of
the region immediately outside the
accessible environment have very great
assurance that they will suffer no, or
negligible. ill effects from the
repository.''
The individual protection
requirements in the final rule limit the
annual exposure from tUhe disposal
system to a member of the public in the
accessible environment, for the first
1,D00 years afler disposal, to no more
than 25 millirems to the whole body or
75 millirems to any organs. These
limitations apply to the predicted
behavior of the disposal system,
including consideration of the
uncertainties in predicted behavior,
assuming that the disposal system is not
disrupted by human intrusion or the
occurrence of unlikely natural events.
The Agency chose the limits of 25
millirem/year to the whole body and 75
milliremfyear to any organ because it
believes that they represent a
sufficiently stringent kevel of protection
for situations where no more lhan a few
individuals are likely to receive this
exposure. If such sn individual were
exposed to this level over s lifetime
(which seems particularly unlikely given
the localized pathways through which
waste might escape from a geologic
repository]. the Agency estimates his
would cause a 5x 107'chance of
incurring a premature fatal cancer.
In choosing a time period for these
requirements to protect individuals
nearby disposal sysiems, the Agency
took into account concerns such as
those expressed by the SAB by
examining the effects of choosing
different time frames, As 10I00 years
was chosen for the containment
requirements because it is long enough
to encourage use of disposal sites with
natural characteristics that enhance
long-term isolation, 1,D00 years was
chosen for the individual protection
provisions because the Agency's
assessments indicate it ie long enough to
insure that particularly good engineered
barriers would need to be used at
potential sites where some ground water
would be expected to flow through a
rmined geologic repository. Use of a time
much shorter than 1,00 years would not
call for substantial engineered barriers
even at disposal sites with a lot of
ground water flow.
On the other hand, demonstrating
compliance with individual exposure
limits for times much longer than 1,000
years appears to be quite difficult
because of the analytical uncertainties
involved. It would require predicting
radonuclide concentrations-even from
releases of tiny portions of the waste-
in all the possible ground water
pathways flowing in all directions from
the disposal system, at all depths down
to 2,500 feet, as a Junction of time over
many thousands of years. At some of the
sites being considered (and possibly all
of them, depending upon what is
discovered during site characterization)
the only certain way to comply with
such requirements for periods on the
order of 10.D000 years appears to be to
use very expensive engineered barriers
that would rule out any potential
releases over most of this period. While
such barriers could provide longer-term
protection for individuals, they would
not provide substantial benefits to
populations because the containment
and assurance requirements already
reduce population risks to very small
levels.
Based on all of these considerations,
the Agency has decided that s 1000-
year duration is adequate for
quantitative limits on individual
exposures after disposal. For longer time
periods, several of the qualitative
asSurance requirements should help to
reduce the chances that individuals will
receive serious radiation exposures. In
addition. 40 CFR Part 19t in no way
limits the future applicability of the
Agency's drinking water standards [40
CFR Part 141}-which protect
community water supply systems
through institutional controls-or of
similar standards that future generations-
may choose to adopt.
ln assessing the performance of a
disposal system with regard to
individual exposures, all pathways of
radioactive material or radiation rom
the disposal system to people shall be
considered. In particular, the
assessments must assume that
individuals consume all of their drinking
water [2 liters per day) from any portion
of a ''significant source of ground water''
anywhere outside of the ''controlled
area'' surrounding the disposal system.
Significant sources of ground water are
defined to include underground
formations that are likely to be able to
provide enough water for a community
water system as defined in 40 CFR Part
141. (More information regarding this
wastes are generated and when the
projected health effects manifest
themselves made it difficult to
determine what level of residual risk
should be allowed by these disposal
standards, The difficulty arose because
most of the benefits derived in the
process of waste production fall upon
the current generation, while most of the
risks fall upon future generations. Thus,
a potential problem of intergenerational
equity with respect to the distribution of
risks and benefits became apparent.
This problem is sometimes referred to as
the intergenerational risk issue, and it is
not unique to the disposal of high-level
radioactive wastes. If the Agency tried
to insure that these standards fully
satisfied a criterion of intergenerational
equity with respect to the distribution of
risks and benefits, it might appear that
no risk should be passed on to :ture
generations. This is a condition which
the Agency believes cannot be met by
disposal technologies foreseeable within
this century. However, there is one
particular factor which has reinforced
EPA's decision about the
reasonableness of the risks permitted
under the disposal standards. This is the
following evaluation of the risks
associated with undisturbed uranium
ore bodies. Additionally, for the purpose
of comparing the risks permitted under
the standards to other radiation risks
which people are currently exposed to, a
brief discussion of the risks from other
natural sources of radiation is also
included.
Uronium Ore: Most uranium ore in the
United States occurs in permeable
geologic strata containing flowing
ground water. Radionuclides in the ore,
particularly uranium and radium.
continuously enter this ground water.
EPA estimated the potential risks from
these undisturbed ore bodies using the
same generalized environmental models
that were used for releases from a waste
repository. The effects associated with
the amount of ore needed to produce the
high-level wastes that would fill the
model geologic repository can vary
considerably. Part of this variation
corresponds to actual differences from
one ore body to another; part can be
attributed to uncertainties in the
assessment. After revising the
population risk models in accordance
with the recommendations of the SAB
Subcommittee, these estimates of the
risks from unmined ore bodies ranged
from about 10 to more than 100.000
excess cancer deaths over 10.000 years,
Thus, leaving the ore unmined appears
to present a risk to future generations
comparable to the risks from disposal of
wastes covered by these standards.
Variations in Natural Background:
Radionuclides occur naturally in the
earth in very large amounts, and are
produced in the atmosphere by cosmic
radiation. Everyone is exposed to
natural background radiation from these
natural radionuclides and from direct
exposure to cosmic radiation. Individual
exposures average about 100 millirems
per year, with a range of about 60 to 200
milliremfyear. These natural
background radiation levels have
remained relatively constant for a very
long time. According to the same linear.
nonthreshold dose effect relationship
used in EPA's other analyses, an
increase of one millirem per year [about
one percent) in natural background in
the United States would result in about
60 additional deaths per year, or 800.000
over a 10.D00-year period.
Natural Radionuclide Concentrations
in Ground Water: One source of this
exposure to natural background
radiation comes from naturally
occurring radionuclides found in ground
water. Radium is the most important of
the naturally occurring radioactive
materials likely to occur in public water
supply systems, but uranium is also
found in ground waters due to its
natural occurrence. Surveys of
radionuclides in ground water systems
indicate: a United States range of 0.1 to
50 picocuries [pCi] per liter for radium-
226 [with isolated sources exceeding 100
pCifliter). up to 74 pCi/liter for all
alpha-emitting radionuclides other than
uranium [although most of the alpha-
emitting concentrations are below 3
pCi/liter) and up to 650 pCi/liter for
total uranium concentrations. Elevated
radium-226 concentrations are found
along the Atlantic coastal region and the
Midwest; low levels are usually found in
the treated water supplies in the
western States. Elevated uranium and
alpha-emitting radionuclide
concentrations are generally limited to
the Rocky Mountain region and Maine
and Pennsylvania in the east.
The Agency's primary drinking water
regulations (4O CFR Part 141] limit the
contamination levels for radium-226 and
radium-228 to 5 pCifliter and the levels
for total alpha-emitting contamination
fexcluding radon and uranium) to 15
pCilliter. Elevated concentrations of
radium in drinking water are generally a
problem associated with smaller
community water systems, with an
estimated 500 systems exceeding 5 pCif
liter, The Agency's risk assessments
indicate that continuous consumption of
water containing the maximum amount
of radium allowed may cause between
D.7 and 3 cancers per year per million
exposed persons.
Environmental Impacts
A Draft Environmental Impact
Stutement [EIS] was prepared for the
proposed rule, in accordance with tho
Agency's procedures for the voluntary
preparation of ElS's [3o FR 37419).
However, section 121(c) of the NWPA
subsequently exempted this action from
preparation of an EIS under section
102[2](C) of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and from any
environmental review under
subparagraph [E) or (F) of section 1022)
of the NEPA. Accordingly, s Final EIS
has not been prepared for promulgation
of this rule. The potential health impacts
of this action are summarized above,
and much of the information that would
have been contained in a Final EIS is
documented in the Background
Information Document that accompanics
this final version of 4O CFR Part 191.
Regulatory Impacts
This rule was submitted to the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) for
review as required by Executive Order
12291. The final rule has not been
classified as a ''major rule'' in'
accordance with the guidelines provided
by the Executive Order. Any comments
received from OMB and EPA's
responses to those comments are
available for public inspection in the
docket cited above under the heading
''aDDRESSEs.''
The Agency has had to take an
unusual approach in considering the
regulatory impacts of this proposed
action-as required by Executive Order
12291. In most cases, a regulation
concerns an ongoing activity and may
be considered a burden whose costs
should be judged against the regulatory
benefits, Here, it was not possible to
quantify the costs and benefits of this
actiorcompared to the consequences of
no regulation because there is no
specific ''baseline'' program to consider.
The appropriate regulations must be
established before the regulated activity
can even begin. Thus, the typical
perspectives on costs and benefits are
altered. Instead, the Agency evaluated
how the costs of commercial waste
management and disposal might change
in response to different levels of
protection from the containment
requirements, Similar evaluations were
not performed for the wastes from
atomic energy defense activities
because sufficient information was not
available.
To evaluate the effects of diflerent
levels of protection. EPA considered the

Figure 2-4 A glaciological reconstruction of the North
American ice cover between 21,000 and 17,000 BP. A single
Laurentide dome is postulated over Hudson Bay because
postglacial isostatic uplift is greatest there, but the bed was
frozen beneath this dome because few, if any, erratics of
Paleozoic sedimentary rocks from Hudson Bay are found on
the surrounding Precambrian crystalline shield along the ice
divide. Ice streams are shown occupying the fore-deepened
interisland channels on the Arctic continental shelf and in
the ring of elongated lakes radiating from Hudson Bay and
located along the outer boundary of the shield. Floating ice
tongues and ice shelves may have formed beyond ice streams
occupying interisland channels. The extension of a grounded
portion of the Arctic Ocean ice-shelf cover onto northern
Alaska is entirely hypothetical, as discussed in Chapter 8.
Grounded ice lobes and ice fans formed beyond ice streams
occupying elongated lakes. Ice shelves probably became par-
tially grounded as they passed over sills in the narrow straits
between Baffin Island and Greenland, Greenland and Ice-
land, Iceland and the Faeroes, and the Faeroes and Scotland.
The southern Laurentide margin had a surface equilibrium
line separating an inner accumulation zone from an outer
ablation zone; the northern margin did not, except where
katabatic winds flowed down ice streams and into fiords. A
basal equilibrium line separating an inner melting zone from
an intermediate freezing zone was located about midway
across the Canadian Shield, and a second basal equilibrium
line separating the intermediate freezing zone from an outer
melting zone was located near the surface equilibrium line
along the southern Laurentide margin. The present divides
of the Hudson Bay and Great Lakes watersheds are the ap-
proximate locations of these two basal equilibrium lines (see
Chapters 5 and 6). Innuitian and Greenland domes are also
shown, together with minor domes over Nova Scotia, New-
foundland, Devon Island, Iceland, and elsewhere. The Cor-
dilleran ice divide probably had several domes. Ice-free areas
existed on the headlands between fiords, particularly in Baf-
fin Island and Greenland; and on the lee side of islands
separating ice streams, such as Banks Island. The pattern of
flowlines and basal thermal conditions shown is the one used
for the single-dome maximum LLaurentide ice sheet recon-
struction in Chapter f6. Key: Thick solid lines are ice-sheet or
ice-cap margins, thick dashed lines are ice-shelf grounding
lines, thin solid lines are surface flowlines on grounded ice
sheets or ice caps, and thin dotted lines are their extensions
on. floating ice shelves. Areas covered by large dots have
thawed or partially thawed beds, with thawed beds beneath
ice streams and partially thawed beds in zones of basal melt-
ing or freezing (the density of large dots is qualitatively pro-
portional to the degree of ice-bed uncoupling due to thawed
basal conditions). Areas covered by small dots denote sea ice
extent (the density of small dots is greatest along sea-ice
margins). Black areas are open seas beyond the ice-sheet
marine margins, and white blocks scattered in the black areas
represent tabular icebergs calved from these margins (partic-
ularly from ice shelves and where calving bays are migrating
up surging ice streams). Horizontal ruled lines along terres-
trial ice-sheet margins show sectors bordered by proglacial
lakes (no attempt is made to show the areal extent of these
lakes). Heavy broken lines in Figure 2-4 show the approxi-
mate inner and outer boundaries of the Canadian Shield.
Outlines of ice sheets are adapted from Figure 2-2, with
arbitrary ice borders drawn in places where Figure 2-2 lacks
information. Ice shelves are entirely hypothetical and there-
fore were not depicted in Figure 2-2; the possibility that such
ice shelves existed is discussed in Chapter 8.
needed for ice divdes to adjust fully to ice mar-
gins that fluctuated on the order of 100 km every
1000 yr probably prevented full equilibrium con-
ditions along ice flowlines. The fourth and last
major assumption is that the number, type, and
distribution of basal thermal zones is sufficient
to minimize the effect of ice-bed coupling on ice-
sheet volume. Ice volume is affected by extremes
of ice-bed coupling; Figure 5-8 shows that dome
thickness for a melted-bed ice sheet is only 80
percent as great as for a frozen-bed ice sheet
covering the same area.
The first three assumptions are really a single
assumption, namely, that full equilibrium con-
ditions existed everywhere-at ice margins, be-
neath ice sheets, and along ice flowlines-for all
ice sheets. This is an assumption of convenience.
The closest approach to full equilibrium condi-
tions was probably attained at the end of the
period from 21,000 to 17,000 BP. Large ice-mar-
gin fluctuations began shortly thereafter, bedrock
would have had 4000 yr to adjust to nearly con-
stant ice load, and ice flowlines were probably
significantly different before and after that pe-
riod insofar as ice divides and ice margins were
reacting to rapidly changing climatic conditions.
The assumption that all ice margins reached their
maximum extent simultaneously amounts to as-
suming that the largest ice lobes and fans along
terrestrial ice margins all formed simultaneously.
Ice lobes and fans are thin transient features
around the perimeter of the essentially steady-
state core of an ice sheet, and their combined ice
volume was about 0.05 x 10%km%. This compares
with the present-day volume of mountain gla-
ciers and small ice caps (see Chapter 3) and
amounts to only 0.1 m of sea-level equivalent.
The assumption that isostatic equilibrium was
attained can be tested by computing ice volumes
for various values of r in equation (6). We did
this for r = 0 (no isostatic sinking beneath ice
sheets), r = (isostatic bending of continental
rock and flow of mantle rock), and r = 4 (isostatic
bending and flow of continental rock only). The
effect of varying r on ice volume was important.
For example, isostatic sinking of a horizontal bed
by ice of height and thickness h lowers the sur-
face to height h* and the bed to height -h$, so
that isostatic sinking increases ice thickness in
the ratio (h* - h5)h = (1 + r) obtained from
equation (6). This ratio is 1.15 for r = $ and 1.22
for r = 4, a change of 0.07, or about 6 percent.
Incomplete isostatic equilibrium would probably
change r by a similar amount, and an ice thick-
ness smaller by fi percent would reduce late Wis-
consin-Weichselian ice volume by 4.5 x I0kmy%
in our maximum ice-sheet reconstruction and
3.6 x I0%km in ourminimum ice-sheetreconstruc-
tion, The assumption that flowline profiles are in
equilibrium is most reasonable for the nearly
steady-state core of the ice sheet and least rea-
sonable for the ice lobes and fans around the ice-
sheet perimeter. As already mentioned, subtract-
ing these ice lobes and fans decreases late Wis-
consin-Weichselian ice volume by 0.05 x 10km%.
The assumption that basal thermal zones do not
significantly influence ice volume is valid so
long as at least three zones exist beneath major
ice sheets, Both glaciological theory and glacial
geological observations indicate that between
three and four nearly steady-state zones are the
norm-an inner melting zone with minimal ero-
sion beneath ice divides, surrounded by a melted
zone with nearly uniform erosion, surrounded by
a freezing zone with selective linear erosion by
ice streams, surrounded by an outer melting zone
with steady-state basal deposition or an outer fro-
zen zone with basal deposition during disinte-
gration. Small ice sheets may have had only one
or two basal thermal zones, and our largest ice-
volume error would occur if we assigned a frozen
bed condition when a melted bed actually ex-
isted, or vice versa, For example, ice volume for
the small ice sheet on the Putorana Plateau is
reduced about 13 percent when a frozen bed
melts. This would reduce the late Wisconsin-
Weichselian ice volume by 0.05 x 10% km% for
this ice sheet. Assigning the wrong number of
zones to a large ice sheet or the wrong kind of
zone to a small ice sheet could change the total
volume by 0.3 x 10km.
One other assumption that influences late Wis-
consin-Weichselian sea-level estimates from ice-
volume calculations is that our late Wisconsin-
Weichselian Antarctic Ice Sheet reconstruction
is correct. Its additional late Wisconsin-Weich-
selian ice volume was included in the global ice
volumes computed using both our maximum and
minimum reconstructions of Northern Hemi-
sphere ice sheets. Like the maximum Northern
Hemisphere ice sheets, we reconstructed the late
Wisconsin-Weichselian Antarctic Ice Sheet to
the edge of the continental shelf. Chapter 7 re-
views literature that presents alternate argu-
ments against any substantial increase in Antarc-
tic ice volume during late Wisconsin-Weichselian
time, However, that alternate conclusion is based
partly on interpretations of indirect evidence,

The usual procedure for conducting a triaxial compression test is to first apply
the confining pressure all round the cylinder (i.e., o; = 04 = p) and then to apply
the axial load o; - p as the lateral pressure is held constant. In this case, the
triaxial compression experiment can be interpreted as the superposition of a
uniaxial compression test on an initial state of all-round compression. However,
the actual path of loading in service may be quite different; as some rocks demon-
strate strong path effects it may then be desirable to follow different procedures.
For example, the stresses in the rock at the front of a traveling plane wave are
applied simultaneously in all directions. With computer or manual feedback
control, it is possible to follow almost any prescribed path of loading, although as
will be shown later, not all paths can result in fracture under load. For the best
results and a clear interpretation of the effects of load, both the axial shortening,
and the lateral expansion of the specimen should be monitored during loading as
discussed later.
The Brazilian test, described for cylindrical concrete specimens in ASTM
designation' C496-71, is convenient for gaining an estimate of the tensile strength
of rock. It has been found that a rock core about as long as its diameter will split
along the diameter and parallel to the cylinder axis when loaded on its side in a
compression machine (Figure 3.2c). The reason for this can be demonstrated by
examining the stress inside a disc loaded at opposite sides of a diametral plane. In
such a configuration, the horizontal stresses perpendicular to the loaded diameter
are uniform and tensile with magnitude
where P is the compression load, d is the cylinder diameter, and t is the thickness
of the disc (the length of the cylinder). It is much easier to perform this type of test
than to arrange the precise alignment and end preparation required for a direct
tensile test.
THe ''Brazilian tensile strength'' is estimated from the test result by reporting
the value of o, y corresponding to the peak compression load. It should be under-
stood, however, that the actual cause of failure may also reflect the action of the
vertical stress along the vertical diameter in concert with the horizontal tension,
the vertical stress is nonuniform increasing from a compressive stress of three
times o, s at the center of the disc to progressively higher values as the ends are
approached. According to the Griffith theory of failure, the critical point ought
to be the center where the ratio of compression to tension is 3. With a principal
stress ratio of 3, failure ought to result from the application of the tensile stress
alone, without any complication from the simultaneous compression parallel to
the eventual rupture plane. In fact, the Brazilian test has been found to give a
S 50' E. Coordinate axes will be taken as follows: x is horizontal to the east; y is
horizontal north; and z is upward.
The bearing of the upward normal to the plane is the same as the bearing
of its dip, and it rises at a verucal angle complement to the amount of dip. To
apply Equations Al.16 to calculate the stresses across the given plane, given the
local state of stress, we describe each of the axes x', y',z' by a horizontal angle (5)
and a vertical angle (8) as shown in Figure A 1.13; $ is the counterclockwise angle
from x to the horizontal projection of the axis in question while 8 is the vertical
angle between the axis and its horizontal projection. The line Ox' is in the direction
of the upward normal. It proves convenient to take y' positive when directed up the
steepest slope of the plane, that is, opposite to the dip vector, and z' along the strike,
as shown in Figure A1.9. For the indicated bedding plane then, the bearings and
rise angles of the three axes are (Figure A1.12):

conversion of cristobalite to chalcedony or quartz.
The distributon of the silica minerals in Y-7 and ]
Y-8 is first considered in order of increasing stability. ]
Opal is the dominant silica phase in the hot-spring ]
sinter of both drill holes and is also an abundant ce- ]
menting mineral of the near-surface sediments; opal is ]
sparse or absent elsewhere throughout the drill holes. ]
At depth, opal occurs only locally in veinlets in the flow ]
breccia of Y-8. Both recognized species of cristobalite !
are rather erratic in distribution (figs. 3 and 4; tables 5 !
and 7). B-cristobalite is most common in veinlets in the j
sediments of Y-7 and in veinlets in the flow breccia of ;
both drill holes. o-cristobalite is present in the ]
groundmass of most core from Y-7 but is absent from ]
significant intervals of Y-8; a few veinlets include j
a-cristobalite as a relatively early mineral. Chal- ]
cedony is very rare in groundmass and veinlets of Y-7 j
and also in the groundmass of Y-8 but is characteristi- l
cally the earliest veinlet mineral in the sediments of l
Y-8. Quartz has not been reported in Y-7 but is sparse
to abundant in the groundmass and veinlets of Y--8.
Thus, the hotter environment of Y-8 clearly favors
quartz and chalcedony, and with rare exceptions these
minerals are abundant where opal and B-cristobalite
are absent.
This complex picture of the distribution of the silica
minerals can best be understood by focusing on their
occurrence and relative ages in veinlets. Of the 21
veinlets listed in tables 5 and 7 that have two or more
silica species, the relative ages from oldest to youngest
in 18 of these are quartz, chalcedony, a-cristobalite,
-cristobalite, and opal; note that this sequence is also
in the order of highest to lowest thermodynamic stabil-
ity. Y-7-209 (-63.7 m) is a probable exception, as are
the veinlets from Y-8-185.3 (- 56.5 m) and Y-8-197.7
(-60.3 m), where quartz is deposited on chalcedony.
The rarity of these exceptions is surprising in view of
the common deposition of quartz on chalcedony at a
very late stage in cavities in chalcedonic sinter and
elsewhere (White and others, 1956).
The usual sequence from most stable to least stable
is also in the order of increasing solubility in water at
constant temperature (Fournier, 1973). At 100'C, for
example, the solubility of quartz is about 50 ppm, chal-
cedony about 87 ppm, o-cristobalite about 115 ppm,
B-cristobalite about 250 ppm, and amorphous silica
about 370 ppm. Chemical geothermometers indicate
that the thermal waters of Upper Geyser Basin rise to
the surface from a reservoir that is probably rather
homogeneous at a temperature close to 200'C (Four-
nier, 1973, p. 134; Fournier and Truesdell, 1973). At
200C, the solubility of quartz is 260 ppm. With
adiabatic cooling (all excess heat converting water to
steam) to an eventual surface termperature of 93C,
the maximum content of silica in the residual water is
about 330 ppm; if boiled to an intermediate stage of
adiabatic cooling at 150'C, the residual water has 290
ppm of silica. From these relations, we conclude that
water from the reservoir is strongly supersaturated
with respect to quartz, chalcedony, and o-cristobalite
at all temperatures in the drill holes, but is only
slightly supersaturated with respect to ä-cristobalite
and is unsaturated with respect to opal at all tempera-
tures higher than about 80'C (at depths below - 15 m
in Y-7 and -6 m in Y-8).
The indicated occurrence of opal at temperatures as
high as 140'C in Y-7 and 170'C in Y-8 is inconsistent
with these conclusions. Three possible explanations
are: (1) the deep opal was deposited when reservoir
l temperatures and the silica contents of upflowing
i water were much higher; conversion to cristobalite has
l not yet occurred; (2) the deep opal is everywhere asso-
i cited with undevitrified obsidian, which could have a
solubility as high as that of amorphous silica (R.O.
l Fournier, oral commun., 1976); the hot water has lo-
l cally equilibrated with obsidian and has then risen and
i cooled enough to deposit opal; or (3) the deep opal iden-
tified only by its optical properties (isotropic; index of
refraction about 1.46), is nowhere abundant enough to
isolate and confirm as being amorphous by X-ray; it
i may actually be isotropic B-cristobalite of low crystal-
l linity. We suspect, but cannot prove, that the third
alternative is correct.
How are the two strong tendencies for paragenesis
, from most stable to least stable, and for mutual excln-
l sion of quartz and chalcedony from cristobalite and
opal, best reconciled? Were all silica minerals initially
1 deposited in their present form or does the sequence
1 indicate conversion through time from less stable
] forms to more stable forms? White, Brannock and
] Murata (1956) and Murata and Larson (1975) have

] eral; a water supersaturated with respect to opal tends

quartz. If this concept is valid, the present mineral as-

Abstract
The temperature of the dehydration of interlayer water of Na-montmorillonite (SWy-l,
American Clay Mineral Society Source Clay) is determined at pressures to 1 kbar, using
differential thermal analysis (DTA). Two dehydration reactions occur, about 40' and 100'C
above the boiling curve of water. Above the critical point of water the dehydration
reactions show only a modest increase of temperature with pressure. No significant
differences in temperature were found using different heating rates and different size
fractions, as defined by their hydraulic diameter. The presence of two dehydration
reactions suggests that not all interlayer water is bonded equally; a distinction may be made
between weakly bonded and strongly bonded water. It is concluded that hydrated Na-
montmorillonite is stable under normal pressure and temperature distributions in sedimen-
tary basins; in these basins dehydration must involve more complex chemical interactions
with pore fluids. The large increase in the stability of a hydrated montmorillonite with a
modest increase in pressure may have important bearing in its use in nuclear waste
disposal.
AIthough early work had been done on the composition of uranium ions
most of the recent work has been carried on by various Atomic Energy
Commission research projects, Pisani (25) did the early work on the car-
bonate complexes and Wilder (31) has done recent work on the composition
of the uranyl carbonate complex. Pascal (27) investigated the stability of
uranium hydrophosphate and uranium pyrophosphate. Kunin (20) de-
termined the stability of the uranyl ion as a function of pH. Harned (11)
worked on mixtures of uranium IV and uranium VI.
Most of the stability investigations to date are of little use to the geol-
ogist. This results because concentrations of uranium ions above neutral-
ization amounts have not been obtained and the stability of the uranium
ions at elevated temperatures have not been investigated.
Since the writing of this report Garrels (8) has published additional data
on the thermodynamic relations of uranium oxides and Gruner (9) has
published the results of his recent geochemical experiments.

METHODS OF URANIUM ANALYSES
Two analytical procedures were used for the determination of uranium
in solution, each depending on the concentration of the sample. The [ones
reductor with a potassium permanganate titration was used for the analyses
of solutions with a uranium concentration of 10 M or greater. Solutions
with uranium concentrations between 10- M and 10M were analyzed by
colorimetric methods. All precipitates were analyzed by x-ray diffraction
methods.
The Jones Reductor Method.-This method of analysis depends upon the
quantitative oxidation-reduction of uranium. In the [ones reductor,
uranium is quantitatively reduced to uranium (IV) and uranium (II1),
then aerated completely to uranium (IV), and finally titrated to uranium
(VI) by means of a suitable oxidant.
The Jones reductor used in these experiments was a -inch column of
3malgamated zinc in a cylindrical reduction tube. Solutions of uranium,
n 4N sulfuric acid, were allowed to pass through the zinc column at a rate
xf 15 ml per minute. The column was then washed thoroughly with 4N
sulfuric acid and finally by water. The resulting mixture of uranium (IV)
nd (III) was aerated by rapid agitation with a magnetic stirrer to insure
xxidation of red uranium (III) to green uranium (IV). Quadravalent
ranium is stable in the presence of air for a few hours but over a period of
iays is completely oxidized to uranium (IV). The solution of uranium

Thermal gravimetric analyses of heulandite at a heating rate of 40f per
hour show a sharp steepening of the weight loss curve also in the region of
250 C. No break in the weight loss curve was noted for clinoptilolite.
Other authors have indicated thermal reactions for heulandite close to
120' C., but no evidence of such phenomena could be found in this study
(see Milligan and Weiser, 1937).
If the differences in thermal stability between heulandite and clinoptilo-
lite are due solely to the nature of the exchange cation in each spees
(ide infra) one might expect a calcium-exchanged clinoptilolite to ex-
hibit the low temperature reactions and low thermal stability of heuland-
ite. Conversely, a sodium-exchanged heulandite should be more ther-
mally stable than the calcium variety. Such is not the case, Clinoptilolite
from Hector, California, was almost completely exchanged to the calcium
form by repeated slurrying with a large excess of a 1 Normal calcium
chloride solution. A chemical analysis of the washed product gave 6.4
wt-9 CaO, 0.2 wt-'7 Na4O. If it is assumed that no eschange of the
potassium and magnesium occurred, the clinoptilolite product is greater
than 907, calcium exchanged. The d spacings and intensities of the peaks
are virtually identical with those of the original clinoptilolite. A sodium-
rich form of heulandite could not be prepared by the above methods even
when boiling sodium chloride solutions were used,

thereby reducing I by at least one-half (Table 1).
Third, it is possible that past climates were sub-
stantially warmer or drier than those of historic
time; I and P could have been lower and (or) E
could have been higher in direct response to
climatic change.
It is unlikely, however, that any of these three
conditions prevailed for large fractions of the
past 100,000-130,000 yr. And even if one or
more of them did, Tulare Lake's paleolimnology
suggests that, with a few possible exceptions, the
lake still overflowed frequently.
Volume of Tulare Lake Basin
The Corcoran Clay Member is the only
known evidence of a Quaternary lake basin in
the Tulare Lake area with a volume vastly
greater than that of historic Tulare Lake basin.
Lacustrine deposits of the past 100.000-130,000
yr neither approach the Corcoran in lateral
extent, nor are known to exceed greatly the
extent of historic Tulare Lake at overflow level
(Figs. 4, 6). Tulare Lake basin probably was
somewhat deeper than it is today during deposi-
tion of the upper part of the Chatom silt and
during deposition of the lower part of the Blake-
ley Canal silt (Table 3). It is unlikely, however,
that the late Wisconsin basin was too large to
allow overflow under a climate like that of the
19th century. If post-Chatom sedimentation in
Tulare Lake has almost offset tectonic subsi-
dence at the 0.33-0.40 m/1,000 yr rates implied
by depth to the Corcoran Clay Member (Figs. 4,
7), and if the lake's spillway has undergone little
post-Chatom incision or aggradation, then the
post-Chatom volume of Tulare Lake basin has
been decreased chiefly by subsidence of the spill-
way. If the spillway has subsided in post-
Chatom time at the rate of 0.2 m/1,000 yr
implied by depth to the Corcoran (Fig. 2), then
11,000-13,000 yr of spillway subsidence affect-
ing a 2,000-km lake would have reduced lake-
basin volume by 5-6 km?. Tulare Lake basin
therefore may have held --12-13 km? at the
Chatom-Blakeley Canal transition, nearly twice
as much as the historic basin but only 1-2 km?
more than the volume attained by Tulare Lake
when overflowing at altitude 66 m in A.D.
1853, 1862, and 1868. From these considera-
tions, we generalize that there is no plausible
value of V that could have kept Tulare Lake
from overflowing frequently during the past
100000-130,000 yr without a substantial de-
crease in (I + P) - E.
Course of the Kings River
Although little is known about prehistoric
variations in I at Tulare Lake, two properties of
the Kings River's exposed distributary systems
timate for northern New Mexico given in
Table 1 may be too small.
On the other hand, the positions of small
(1 km%3 glaciers and of nivation hollows
(Flint, 1971, p. 134)should accurately reflect
the position of orographic snowline. There-
fore, the orographic depression estimates
for northeast Arizona (1200 m), east-central
Arizona (790-910 m), and central New
Mexico (1300 m), all based on such features,
do not suffer from the above error. The same
is true for the regional depression estimates,
because they are not based on cirque eleva-
tions. However, the climatic indicators used
in locating the modern snowline for the
listed depression estimates must now be ex-
amined.
Today, snowline lies above most moun-
tains in the Southwest. This means that it's
altitude must be reconstructed from climatic
data. Antevs (1952), Leopold (1951), and
Richmond (1965) believed modern snowline
to be controlled primarily by the summer
(July) freezing isotherm. Thus they located
modern snowline in the southern Rocky
Mountains at the radiosonde-determining
position of this isotherm. However, this
supposed correlation of modern snowline
with the July 0'C isotherm is not supported
by ground-level, long-term, meteorologic
data. Figure 1 shows that the present oro-
graphic snowline obtained from elevations
of modern small glaciers (Table 2) rises
southward from latitude 46 to 40'N at no
less than 100 m/1' latitude. If higher latitude
glaciers are considered, the gradient may
be steeper, but for the present purpose the
minimum slope needed to fit points within
these latitude limits is most relevant. It is
clear that modern small glaciers do not
match the slope of the 0'C July isotherm,
which rises at a gradient of only 25 m/1' lati-
tude. The -6'C annual isotherm matches
modern snowline much better, both in terms
of gradient and elevation (Fig. 1). Thus, the
available data favor use of the -6'C annual
isotherm as the best indicator of modern
orographic snowline in the southwest.
A Revised Estimate of Snowline Depression
As noted, where the depression estimates
in Table 1 are based on (1) modern snowline
located by the July 0'C isotherm andlor (2)
relict cirques at the head of glaciated val-
leys, the depression estimates may be in
error. Therefore, as an aid in estimating an
average ''true'' orographic depression value
for the southwest, Wisconsin cirques from
Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico were
selected on the basis of lack of evidence for
large-scale valley glaciation. These were ob-
tained from the literature, and modern topo-
graphic maps were used to check cirque
floor elevations (Table 3). The cirques in
Nevada are considered late Wisconsin in
age and those in northern and central Ari-
zzona and south-central New Mexico have
been more precisely correlated with the
early and middle Pinedale stades (Updike
and P&we, 1974; Richmond, 1963). Regres-
sion analysis was performed on the ports
The surrounding vegetation is dominated
by second-growth Jeffrey pine (Pinus jef-
freyi) and lodgepole pine (Pinus mur-
rayana). White fir (Abies concolor) is
present in lesser amounts and red fir (Abies
magnifica) is also present. Other trees in-
clude a few incense cedars (Calocedrus
decurrens)and California black oaks (uer-
cus kelloggii) and a grove of quaking aspen
(Populus tremuloides) at the head of the
meadow. Bush chinquapin (Chrysolepis
sempervirens) and Sierra gooseberry (Ribes
roezlii) grow on the rocky outcrop east of
the meadow.
The meadow vegetation is dominated by
sedges, rushes, and mosses. Carex prae-
gracilis, Carex rostrata, Scripus congdonii,
Juncus orthophyllus, and Juncus pacificus
grow near the coring site and Potamogeton
illinoensis grows in the adjacent stream.
Two species of dock (Rumex acetosella and
on the right-hand sides of (1)-(3) evaluated every
fifth time step (i,e., every 30 min). Starting from
initial conditions for 1 May as obtained from an
earlier independent run, the model was integrated
through the months of May, June and July, with a
fised distribution of (July) sea-surface temperature
and daily adjustments of the solar zenith angle.
A statistical quasi-equilibrium was reached during
June, and the July climatic statistics were determined
by averaging the 6 h solutions during the last 31 days
of the integration. About 15 min is required on an
cbmputer to simulate one model day.
3. Ice-age boundary conditions
In addition to the specification of the various
physical constants and empirical parameters used, the
atmospheric model requires the specification of the
surface character (i,e., whether bare land, open water
or ice-covered land or water), along with the surface
elevation, the surface temperature of the ocean and
the surface albedo. The July distribution of these
surface boundary conditions as assembled by CLIMAP
(1976) from a variety of paleoclimatic sources for the
ice-age of 18 000 YBP are shown in Figs, 3-5, along
with the corresponding distributions for the present
July. These conditions are those used in the model's
numerical simulations of the [uly ice-age and present-
day July climate, as appropriate.
a, Surface elevation and ice sheets
The elevation of the earth's surface as reconstructed
for 18 000 YBP is shown in Fig. 3a, along with the
these corrections to the diagram would lower the curve (C D E in the im-
mediate vicinity of D, smoothing out the angle at that point, would leave it
unchanged where it intersects the ordinate of 0f, and would carry thhe point
E farther to the right. It would raise the curve A B at A, and lower it at
1B, leaving the central portion unchanged. The point A, or the intersection
with the horizontal axis, would be thrown to thhe left.
Fifthly, in the construction of the curves no allowance was made for
evaporation during summer. The curve D E includes only winter evapora-
tion, the curve A B only summer melting. The rate of evaporation for
snow and ice has its maximum at 0%, its law changing at that point. In
thie general law for aqueous evaporation, the rate of evaporation is a func-
tion of the difference between thne saturation tension corresponding to the
temperature of the evaporated substance and the actual vapor tension of
the evaporating air. Since snow and ice can not rise in temperature above
0', they can only be evaporated when the aqueous tension of the air in
contact with them is less than the saturation tension for 0%, If it rises above
that, moisture is deposited on the ice as dew, instead of being abstracted
from it. In all but very exceptional cases the range of summer tempera-
tures under which n6v6 can evaporate is small-from 0% to 5% oF 6%. The
effect of the evaporation is to retard the wasting of the ice, for the energy
consumed by it is deducted from that available for melting, and a unit of
solar heat can melt seven times as much ice as it can evaporate.' The cor-
rection, if applied to the curve of melting, would slightly increase its upward
concavity.
Sisthly, the winter evaporation embodied with thhe winter precipitation
in the curve D E is tacitly assumed to have a rate corresponding to the
mean annual temperature; its rate is really less, being a function of the
mean winter temperature. An error is thus manifestly introduced, and this
error is greatest for the annual temperatures corresponding to short winters.
A corresponding correction of the diagram would raise the line D E by
amounts increasing progressively from D to E.
averages of P and (P - E ), using the modified equation
where e is the ratio of total land area to the area of internal
drainage (endorheic area) within this belt. We assume that
P e P, = P4, As a first approximation, in view of the paucity of
runoff data from the subtropical deserts, the adjustable para-
meter e was introduced to partition the runoff between the areas
of internal drainage in which closed lakes can form and the
areas draining to the ocean. The modern area-average value of
e for the study area is 2.6 (ref. 25). Thus, for the modern
simulation, -38% (1/2.6) of the model-generated area-average
(P - E) is available for runoff to closed interior basins. No
attempt has been made to estimate the z ratio for lakes within
the areas of external drainage, to which equation (1) is not
applicable. In fact, many additional lakes developed during the
early and mid-Holocene along river systems draining into the
ocean'-4'
The CCM does not calculate E; explicitly for hypothesized
interior lakes. Moreover, except for large enclosed seas, such
as the Mediterranean and Caspian, its coarse spatial resolution
precludes explicit simulation of inland water bodies. A modern
value of E, = 2,600 mm yr'' was assumed. This is representative
of Lake Chad (13* N) in dry years'' and is comparable with the
evaporation rate calculated by the CCM for tropical ocean areas
with offshore winds. It is also comparable to the rate obtained
if the model-generated winds and mixing ratios over land (8.9-
26.6' N) are adjusted for flow over a water surface with a drag
coefficient intermediate between land and open ocean. In the
palaeolake simulations, E; has been varied in proportion to the
calculated changes in land evaporation, to allow for variations
in surface temperature, humidity and wind speed.
Results
The area-averaged CCM results and their statistical signific-
ance are summarized in Figs 3-4, and Table 1. In July, the net
radiation increases from 164 W m'f at 18 kyr BP to a peak of
181 W m'' in the 9 kyr BP experiment (12% greater than the
control) and then decreases again (Fig. 3a ). In January it varies
in the opposite direction, reaching its minimum (- 16%) at 9 kyr
BP.
The surface-temperature lowering at 18 kyr BP is 3.5 K in
January and 2.0 K in July (Fig. 3b). Although the estimated
mean-annual temperature rises rapidly after 12 kyr BP and does
not differ significantly from the control case in the 9, 6 and 3 kyr
BP experiments, the seasonal temperature range is ?-4 K greater
than today between 15 and 6 kyr BP, and 3-4 K greater at 12
and 9 kyr BP. The highest July temperature departure (+ 1.3 K)
occurs in the 9 kyr BP experiment.
The simulated changes in the January surface wind field are
small. In July, the CCM indicates weak northwesterly flow at
18 and 0 kyr aP (Fig. 3c). In marked contrast, the wind direction
at 15, 12, 9 and 6 kyr BP is southwesterly. This intensified
low-level monsoon flow, consistent with lower pressure over the
continents and higher pressure over the oceans, reaches its
greatest strength and statistical significance at 9 kyr BP, implying
an increased transport of moisture from the oceans onto the
Northern Hemisphere land masses.
Figure 4summarizes the simulated hydrological cycle for each
experiment. In July, the precipitation rate is lowest at 18 and
0 kyr BP, attaining its maximum values in the 9 and 6 kyr BP
simulations (2.1 and 18 mm day''' greater than the control value
of 5.6 mm day''', respectively, representing 30-35% increase in
precipitation (p 0.05). Although the land evaporation rate is
also greater (p 0.01) at these times, as a result of higher summer
Miller and Wendorf report ( 136): ''Flora and fauna,
along with such physical features as buried pond de-
posits, clearly indicate deposition under conditions more
moist than at present.'' Although they considered such
evidence to be known from many parts of the South-
west, they noted that direct fossil evidence for climatic
fluctuation is exceedingly sparse in the alluvium they
studied in the Tesuque Valley. At Chaco Canyon, Bryan
(28) was careful to point out that the postpluvial
alluvial deposits there did not produce incontestable
fossil evidence of a wetter climate in the past. Regard-
ing erosion and alluviation in the Near East near Jarmo,
Wright (185) took the precaution to comment that his
climatic interpretation of drought during the postglacial
optimum rested largely on the occurrence of erosion at
that time, not on fossil evidence of aridity. Other geolo-
gists have not always been equally candid in identifying
their presuppositions.
If alluviation occurred under wetter climates and
cutting occurred during or following drought, as is
commonly assumed, one might expect to see such evi-
dence in the pollen record. Such evidence is not ap-
parent. On the contrary, pollen evidence of wetter
conditions during the postpluvial period was found
in sediments closely associated with the time of alti-
thermal erosion.
The oldest period of alluviation, prior to altither-
mal erosion, is commonly considered to represent de-
position under relatively humid conditions. This con-
clusion is based on presence of extinct animal remains
and it raises the question of the ecological and climatic
meaning of the mammoth, camel, and other fossil
mammals.
Extinct Megafauna. Fossil evidence often viewed as
proof that deposition occurred under humid climates
is the presence of extinct animal remains in certain
early postpluvial alluvial beds (deposition 1 of Table 8).
The suggestion that elephants, horses, camels, and other
large mammals of western North America succumbed
to drought following the last pluvial period can be
traced at least to the time of Russell (149). Russell's
view has become embedded in the scientific literature
(111, 1, 27, 104, 91, 78, 79, 7, 62). An essential pant
of the theory is the notion that to thrive large anitmals
require luxuriant vegetation. For example, regarding
New Mexico near the San Jon site, Judson (95) wrote:
''It is inconceivable that a mammoth could survive on
the meager vegetation and surface water of today... .''
Is there biological evidence for such an opinion?
Prehistorians and geologists might recall the re-
flections of Darwin (46) ''that large animals require a
luxuriant vegetation has been a general assumption
which has passed from one work to another; but I do
not hesitate to say that it is completely false, and that
it has vitiated the reasoning of geologists on some
points of great interest in the ancient history of the
world. The prejudice has probably been derived from
India and the Indian islands, where troops of elephants,
noble forests, and impenetrable jungles are associated
together in everyone's mind. If, however, we refer to
any work of travels through the southern parts of

way to the point where the river has cut through; it then falls off with an
abrupt descent to a level six or eight feet lower, the crest of the structnre
at the same time becoming broadened and curved slightly westward. Con-
tinuing southward, one descends three more similar scarps of less height
before reaching the lowest point in the embankment. Each of these
descents is formed by the end of a comparatively thin layer of grasel that
was added by the currents to the surface of the structure, and wonld no
doubt have been carried along its whole extent had not a rise in the lnke
caused the currents to begin the formation of another similar sheet of gravel
near the shore and at a higher level. Each of the steps in the crest of thhe
embankment represents a pause in the rise of the waters of the ancient lake.
T'he highest in the series was the last formed. The incompleteness in this
instance furnishes the suggestion that similar embankments which seem from
their form to be homogeneous may in reality be highly compound. Th4

atmosphere at such times, Dust-storms are common on the deserts during
the arid season, and impart to the atmosphere a peculiar haziness that lasts
for days and perhaps weeks after the storms have subsided, Whirl-winds
8upply a characteristic feature in the atmospheric phenomena of the Far
West especially during calm weather, as noted already, and frequently form
hollow dust-columns two or three thousand feet or even more in height,
which may many times be seen in considerable numbers moving here and
there over the valleys, The loose material thus swept about at the caprice
of the winds tends to accumulate on certain areas and forms dunes or drifts
that at timmes cover many square miles of surface, During its journey
across the country the material which finds a resting place in the dunes
becomes assorted with reference to size and weight, so that the resulting
sand-drifts are usually homogeneous in their composition, but are character-
ized by extreme irregularity of structuure when seen in section, In the
Lahontan basin the subaärial deposits are usually composed of fine, sharp
quartz sand, but in some instances small drifts are principally formed of the
cases of ostracoid crustaceans.
A large area buried beneath sand dunes of post-Lahontan date occurs
a few miles north of Winnemucca and extends westward from the lower
part of Little Bumboldt Valley to the desert between Black Butte and the
Dona Sehee Hilla, This belt of drifting sand is about forty miles long from
east to west by eight or ten miles in width. The drifts are fully seventy-five
feet thick and present their steeper slopes to the eastward, thius indicating the
direction in wlich the whole vast field of sand is slowly travelling. No
measurements of the rate at which these drifts advance has been made, but
their progress is evidently quite rapid, as it has necessitated a number of
changes in thhe roads in the southern part of Little Bumboldt Valley during
the past few years, In some places in the same region the telegraph-poles
have been buried so deeply that they required to be spliced in order to
keep the wires above the crests of the dunes 'Thhe sand is here of a light
creamy-yellow color, and forms beautifully curved ridges and waves that
are covered with fret-work of wind-ripples, and frequently marked in thne
most curious manner by the foot-prints of animals, thus foruming strange
hieroglyphics that are sometitmes difficult to translate.

same age throughout the deposit. The Overburden ]
Mud, which is more heterogeneous, consists of inter- j
bedded mud and saline layers. In the central part of ]
the deposit, its basal contact is gradational and con- ]
sists of a zone having an upward increase in the per- ]
centage of clastic-rich mud layers and a decrease in '
saline layers; around the edges, the contact is at the
base of a zone of solid mud that includes near-shore
equivalents of horizons in the Upper Salt as well as in
the Overburden Mud.
In studying cores, it is generally easy to separate the
mud units from the saline units. The muds' are mostly
dark green to brown, soft, and appear nonporous.
They consist chiefly of chemical precipitates made up
of Ca, Na, and Mg combined with CO,. The major
minerals are fine-grained aragonite and dolomite and
fine- or coarse-grained gaylussite and pirssonite (the
names and chemical compositions of the nonclastic
minerals in the Searles Lake evaporites are given in

creases in human mutations due to the action of any environmental agent
is still difficult. For somatic abnormalities induced in utero by radiation,
the position is somewhat intermediate-that is, some human data have
been obtained, but we also depend on animal data.
The emphasis on human studies for determining the somatic effects of
ionizing radiation remains valid, although theoretical and experimental
studies continue to be important in extending our basic knowledge. For
most types of health effects occurring in those exposed to radiation, we
now have considerable human experience, as the balance of this report
shows, Moreover, in terms of establishing human risk estimates, it is a
well-recognized principle in the field of environmental toxicology that
results obtained in animal experiments are not necessarily translatable
directly to human populations. For example, the fact that the human pop-
ulation is genetically heterogeneous, with widely varying individual
physiologic and biochemical characteristics, makes it likely that there are
subpopulations at special risk from radiation exposure. It is difficult to
simulate this kind of heterogeneity in animal populations, other than by
inferences drawn from species variation in responses or from differences
in susceptibility between strains of a given species.
We lack adequate information on the effects of low radiation doses in
human populations, and in this regard we still depend on concepts that
have been developed on the basis of experimental studies. In this report,
these studies are discussed in some detail.
Although epidemiologic studies constitute our principal source of infor-
mation on somatic effects of ionizing radiation in human populations, one
must recognize that there are problems in their use. The first problem
arises from the fact that generally the group has been exposed to radiation
because of some particular characteristic and thus may not be represen-
tative of the population at large. The reasons why those exposed to radia-
tion are not typical of the general population may not affect radiation sen-
sitivity, but an appropriate comparison group is nonetheless required.
The epidemiologic technique to deal with the scientific problem of a
potentially biased sample is to obtain a control group matched as nearly as
possible to the exposed persons. In radiation epidemiology, considerable
effort has been made to deal with the question of the suitability of a con-
trol group. For example, in the Japanese atomic-bomb survivors, the zero-
dose groups (those in the cities at the time of the bombing, but so far away
from the bomb detonation that they were not exposed) are useful controls,
although in the Nagasaki sample they are comparatively few. An alter-
native method has been to consider the regression of effects (such as
cancer rates) on radiation dose. Systematic differences in rates of cancer
not related to radiation exposure, for example, might be expected to be
to determine whether the simplest extrapolation curve, the linear no-
threshold model adopted by the subcommittee to estimate cancer risks
from low LET radiation, is reasonable or not. As the above comments in-
dicate, use of the linear extrapolation can hardly be considered to provide
an ''extreme'' estimate of low-dose risk.
The only population study that does provide dose-response data of this
type is that of the Japanese A-bomb survivors. It is not generally recog-
nized that the strength of the Japanese data in epidemiologic terms lies in
data obtained for low doses, less than 100 rad kerma. The major part of
the number of survivors with significant exposures are in the two dose
groups, 10-49 rad kerma, or a mean tissue dose of about 1l rad, and
50-99 rad kerma, or a mean tissue dose of about 35 rad. For doses greater
than 200 rad kerma, about 120 rad mean tissue dose, the numbers of sur-
vivors included in the Life Span Study October 1, 1950, and who were over
age 20 at the time of the bombing (the group in which nearly all cancer
deaths had occurred between 1950 and 1974) were only 942 in Hiroshima
and 684 in Nagasaki, numbers that are small enough that if the dose is
fractionated further into three dose categories, as has been done in RERF
Report 8, the results are likely to lead to statistically unstable estimates of
excess cancer risk, especially in Nagasaki. Thus, it is fair to say that in the
long run, a principal value of data obtained from this study population
will be to permit estimation of cancer risk from acute exposures in a range
of 10-3S rad mean tissue dose.
The fact that the A-bomb survivors are the only large group with a wide
range of whole body radiation exposure makes them singularly important
in dose-response evaluation of the carcinogenic effect of radiation in man.
There was general agreement for this position among the subcommittee
members, and it was the reason that extensive debate concerning inter-
pretation of the follow-up data through 1974 from RERF Report 8, took
place up to the final meeting of the subcommittee.
The areas of discussion revolved especially around interpretation of the
Nagasaki data to evaluate effects of low LET radiation. Because the
Hiroshima bomb led to a significant neutron exposure whose effect was
difficult to assess independently, the Nagasaki data thus became the basis
for defining low LEr radiation effects. Unfortunately, the Nagasaki study
population is much smaller than the Hiroshima group, and is especially
small in the zero dose category, the accepted control population for the ex-
posed populations. A better control population can be developed by com-
bining the zero dose group and those exposed to 1-9 rad kerma (mean
tissue dose about 1.8 rad), an approach which has been widely used to im-
prove the analysis by investigators reporting results from these studies.
Regardless of the control base selected, however, the data from Nagasaki
Thus far, after exposure periods of 4-5 yr and cumulative doses of more
than 11,000 wLM, seven dogs among the groups exposed to radon and
uranium have developed lung cancer: three bronchoalveolar cancers
(without cigarette-smoking), three epidermoid cancers (smoking status
not stated, but one evidently nonsmoking), and one fibrosarcoma of the
peripheral lung (nonsmoking). In animals of these groups that were
sacrificed after 40 mo or more, extensive adenomatosis was found at
the bronchoalveolar junction, as well as granulomas and bullous emphy-
sema,' Three dogs have had squamous carcinomas of the nasal mucosa
(two nonsmoking and one smoking). No cancer at any site has appeared
among the smoking dogs not exposed to radon and uranium, and at 4-S yr
pulmonary changes have been minimal in this group.
The Hanford group has exposed hamsters and rats to radon daughters
(900 and 1,200 wL) with and without uranium-ore dust (15 mg/m') for
5 mo, with total cumulative doses of about 10,000-12,000 wLs.'
Squamous metaplasia of the nasopharynx was a very common observation
in both hamsters and rats exposed to radon daughters only, and there
were a few squamous-cell cancers of the nasal epithelium. The groups ex-
posed to dust and radon daughters had changes in the deep lung, instead
of nasal mucosal metaplasia. Hamsters thus exposed had no lung neo-
plasia, but did have fibrosis, emphysema, and adenomatosis, However,
rats exposed to radon daughters and dust had a high proportion of bron-
choalveolar squamous carcinomas and occasional adenocarcinomas. It is
evident that hamsters were more resistant than rats to development of
lower respiratory tract neoplasia. Moreover, the contrast in results be-
tween those exposed and not exposed to dust indicates that radiation ex-
posure without dust was chiefly to the upper airway, presumably owing to
absorption there of the free-ion fraction of radon daughters,
Little and colleagues have demonstrated bronchoalveolar cancer induc-
tion from polonium-210 instilled intratracheally in hamsters at mean
doses as low as 15 rads,'' A single dose of 100 nCi in 0.2 ml of saline pro-
duced tumors in fewer animals (two of 31) than a slightly lower cumulative
dose given in 15 instillations each of 5.6 nCi each (14 of 59 animals).
A most important observation in these experiments has been that instilla-
tion of salt solution alone increased the effects of polonium instillation.
For example, if, under the same conditions of exposure, the single instilla-
tion (100 nCi) was followed by 14 weekly intratracheal instillations of 0.2
ml of normal saline, the proportion of animals with tumors was approxi-
mately the same as in the group given 15 instillations of S.6 nCi, A num-
ber of such experiments have shown the enhancement of lung-cancer
production in hamsters from alpha-radiation exposure by this potential
stimulus to bronchial cell proliferation.- Saline alone was as effective in
certainty a dose below which teratologic effects in man are not induced by
exposure at sensitive stages in development. As discussed above, such
thresholds do, however, probably exist, and they may be higher for pro-
tracted or fractionated radiation than for acute single exposures, '%.24.138
Radionuclides Administered During Pregnancy
The effects of various radioisotopes administered to pregnant mammals
have been less extensively studied than the effects of externally ad-
ministered radiation. Furthermore, one cannot generalize on the effects of
administered radionuclides, because, depending on the chemical form and
the type and energy of the emitted radiation, they may or may not cross
the placenta, they may have specific target organs, the distribution of
radiation may be nonrandom, the metabolism of radioactive elements or
compounds may vary greatly from person to person because of individual
biologic variations or because of the disease state of a given subject, and
the change in dose rate with time may be difficult to evaluate.
Radioisotopes administered to the mother may also affect the newborn if
they are administered shortly before birth, because many are excreted in
the breast milk, .178
In any event, before one can estimate the potential hazard of ad-
ministering a radioactive nuclide or compound to a pregnant woman, one
must determine with some accuracy the total dose to the fetus or a par-
ticular fetal tissue, the dose rate and how it varies with time, and the
stages of gestation during which the radiation is received.
Until recently,'?! the radioactive isotopes of iodine were the radionu-
clides most commonly used in nuclear medicine. The two most important
ones are iodine-131 and iodine-125. Although inorganic iodide readily
crosses the placenta, iodine attached to proteins, hormones, and even
radioactive rose bengal is less likely to cross, However, a significant
amount of iodine usually is released from the labeled compounds and
becomes available to the fetus. There is probably no radioactively labeled
iodine compound that does not release some iodine to the circulation after
administration.
The human fetal thyroid does not take up iodine before the twelfth
week; 8thereafter, however, its uptake increases, and it comes to a peak
in the sith month.'' In the mouse, there is some evidence that the fetal
thyroid has a greater avidity for iodine than does the maternal thyroid.%
Because the human fetal thyroid accumulates considerably more
iodine-131 per gram than do other fetal tissues, an inadvertent
therapeutic dose to the mother of S mCi would deliver 6,500 rads to this
organ and thereby ablate it.?'' If the dose of radioactive iodine is high

the combined transporter/emplacer vehicle except
that the cask is removable from the mainframe. Alter-
nate vehicle concepts include more traditional, articu-
lated designs, with the tractor at one end and the cask
at the other. The transport and emplacement cycle
again starts, with the transporter aligning itself with
the hot-cell door. After the canister is loaded, the
driver heads for the active storage room.
The rail-mounted emplacer gantry-which looks
somewhat like a straddled crane-sits astride the
intersection between the haulageway and the em-
placement room. Upon arrival at the intersection, the
transporter operator drives through the gantry, then
stops with the cask positioned such that two sets of
lifting arms can remove the cask from the transporter.
Perfect alignment of transporter and emplacer is not
necessary because the lift mechanism on the gantry
has 5 degrees of freedom, iie., horizontal (travel),
vertical, axial, and two angular adjustments. Clearly,
these attitude-control features are also required to
align the cask with the emplacement hole.
With the cask firmly held by the gantry lift arms,
the transporter, now without cask, moves from under
the gantry and returns to the hot cell, or waits to
accept an empty cask, The gantry, in the meantime,
travels on rails carrying the cask to the emplacement
hole where it aligns and mates the cask with the
emplacement hole-door. Once mated, the final em-
placement process, described earlier, is performed.
When final emplacement is completed, the gantry
returns to the intersection to unload the now empty
cask onto an empty transporter and accepts a loaded
cask from the next transporter.

Blast planning
it s not unusual for tunnel constructors to fail to
consder the effects of the charges in the rows
adjacent to the often well-planned smooth blasted
contour row. Charging the adjacent rows with a
heavy charge resuits in cracks spreading further
into the remaining rock than from the srmooth
blasted row. It is better to optimize the charge
calculations such that the damage zone from any
hole in the round will not exceed the damage zone
from the contour holes. This can easily be done by
use of F ig. 2(a), where the damage zone is given
for different charge concentrations.
Table 2 contains recommended burdens for some
Swedish explosives for use in smooth blasting. For
a hole diameter of 48 mm and 17-mm GURlT pipe
charges, a burden of 0.8 m is normal, From F ig.
2(a) we find that this charge will result in a darnage
zone of about 0.3 m. Choosing a fully charged hole
oof ANFO (1 = 1.5 kg/m) in the next row with a
damage zone of 1.5 m is of no value because this
results in a damage zone that extends 0.4 m further
into the rock (1.5-0.8-0.3 = 0.4 m) than the
damage zone from the G URIT charges. It would be
better to use a charge concentration that results in
a damage zone equal to that caused by the GUR IT
plus the burden, i,e. 1.2 m (Fig. 5) - such a charge
should have 1 = 0.8-1.2 kgIm.

An important characteristic demonstrated in Figure 4 is
that the error from the linear polarization assunption is
asymmetric, i.e., greater for anodic polarization than for
cathodic or vice versa, except for the 0.5 curve (b,' *
lbu''l). The asymmetry can be very pronounced, as shown
numerically in Tabyie 2. Listed here is the maximum value
of E . E ', below which the linear polarization error remains
less than 5%, The maximum 2E is seen to vary consider-
ably, from 6 to 57 mV, as the anodic Tafel slope is
changed.
Basic information of this type can help the corrosion
engneer decde whether to select anodic or cathodic
polarization for linear polarization measurernents on a given
corroding metal, That is not the only choce open, however,
There is a third technique, namely the dual electrode
technique-an important variation of the small potential
aDproxmation, It combines both anodc and cathodic
DOlarization in a single measurement. A two-electrode cell is
used, in which the electrodes are duplicate specimens of the
test metal, When a potential difference CE is appled across
the twoo electrodes, each experiences a potential change of

to calculate corrosion current from dual-electrode measure-
rments.
The dual electrode technique was first developed in
1963 by Marsh,'' whho utilized polarity reversal of the
applied potential so that both a forward current l; and a
reverse polarity current l, were measured. The average of
these meter readings is inserted into Equation (158) to
calculate 1'. In application of this method to real corroding
metals, allowance must be made for the fact that duplicate
test electrodes seldom yield identical corrosion potentials
or corrosion currents, As Marsh sowed,'' it is necessary to
determine the starting potential difference between the two
test electrodes 1 and 2, (E, - E,), and to calculate the mean
current as 1 = 1r2 (l + ,) when iE, - E(] C l6El and a i

Marsh's reverssl method has been widely applied in
engineering studies of corrosion resittant metals, In fact, in
the past decade, much more electrochemical corrosion rate
data have been generated by dual-electrode polarization
than by anodic or cathodic polarization singy.
A simpler dual-electrode procedure, which eliminates
the polarity reversal feature of Marsh'4 method, was
'ecently reported,'' It is termed ''Direct'' method because

twelve heats indicated IGSCC susceptibility after dynamic strain testing,
with an Isi value of 0.6S established for this heat treatment in this environ-
ment as the lower limit for susceptibility. The most extensive IGSCC noted
occurred in one of the 10.2-cm (4-in.) seamless pipe heats (M7616), where
IGSCC occurred even in the mill-annealed condition (Fig. 2) in this severe
environment. The mill-annealed specimen did reveal some mized mode
cracking (intergranular plus transgranular), but crack initiation was always
intergranular. This particular heat of material was also etremely susceptible
to IGSCC in other studies [,5] using more severe sensitization treatments.
Thislevel of susceptibility would have been predicted by degree of sensitization
measurements using both A 262, Practice A, and the EPR technique. But,
the EPR method provides quantitative data relative to the level of sus-
ceptibility between mill-annealed and sensitized conditions (P, = 7.3 and
40.0 C/cm compares to Iu = 0.69 and 0.92, respectively), while the
A 262, Practice A method shows little differentiation (40 and S0 percent
ditching). The etch structures developed after the A 262, Practice A, and
EPR expusures are shown in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3,
the etent of grain boundary ditching appears comparable for both con-
ditions; however, the EPR-produced structures (Fig. 4) clearly delineate
the difference in grain boundary attack (chromium depletion around carbide
particles) [5] between the mill-annealed and lightly sensitized condtion.
ln contrast, the A 262, Practice E, test does not appear very sensitive
at these lower degrees of sensitization. The structures developed in the
mill-annealed and sensitized specimens after three T2-h exposures are shown
in Fig. S, where penetration depths after straining 3 to S percent can only
be measured with great difficulty. Based on the data developed by A 262,
Practice E, for the other eleven heats, the difference between penetration
depths of 0.2 mil for the mill-annealed condition and 0.4 to 0.8 mil after
sensitizing do not appcar significant.
The 25.4-cm (10-in.) seamless pipe heat (TH6656) revealed the lowest
level (I 4. = 0.65) of IGSCC after sensitizing of the seven susceptible
materials; this material was not susceptible in the mill-annealed condtion.
The fracture surface for this specimen after dynamic strain testing is shown
in Fig. 6. Only one corner of the specimen revealed IGSCC; the remainder
of the specimens failed ductilely (approimately 90 percent of the fracture
surface reveals lGSCC in highly susceptible materials after severe sensitization
treatments) [3]. This specimen also contained only a few secondary cracks,
while highly susceptible materials, such as Heat M7616, usually develop
secondary cracking too numerous for counting.
The etch structures produced in the sensitized Heat TH6656 specimen
during degree of sensitization measurements using the three methods are
shown in Fig. 7. Again, the A 262, Practice E, results are not sufficiently
discerning to predict the IGSCC behavior. Both the A 262, Practice A, and
EPR method reveal a sensitized microstructure, but only the EPR measure-

Introduction
Scanning electron microscope observations of the surface of the reacted wafers from experiments DB7
and DB8 indicated that the secondary minerals present were large enough to be plucked from the surface
of the wafer for more detailed characterization, This was performed by using a binocular microscope and a
dissecting needle dabbed with alcohol. One crystal mass was mounted on the end of a glass fiber and
prepared for XRD analysis using a Gandolfi camera. Many other crystal masses were plucked from the
surface of the wafer and used to prepare an epoxy grain mount. The crystals were confined within a
stainless steel nut that was floated in the partially set epoxy. By carefully polishing the grain mount, we
were able to remove the overlying epoxy and expose the crystals at the surface. This polished grain mount
was suitable for quantitative analyses using WDS techniques on the EMP.
The dominant secondary mineral formed as a result of the hydrothermal interaction of this densely
welded, devitrified ashflow tuff (compositionally a high-silica rhyolite) with a dilute (Na + HCO4)
ground water at 250 C was the rare zeolite dachiardite. Dachiardite is a mordenite-group, high-silica
zeolite with a cation content similar to that of mordenite, with which it is commonly associated (Wise and
Tschernich, 1978). The type locality for dachiardite is a hydrothermally altered zone in a pegmatite near
San Piero di Campo, Elba, Italy (Bonardi, 1979). Its generalized compositon is given as

However, these equilibria are not equally reducible by the
hydrogen ion equilibrium as shown in Figure 14; and only
the iron appears to be significantly oxidized with nickel
being sparingly so. This trend suggests that increasing nickel
would inhibit caustic cracking, which it does. Chromium
forms a soluble species (CrO7 ) but more sparingly than
either nickel or iron at the same pH.
1. Environmental Factors. Siderov and Ryabchenkov
investigated the effect of NaOH concentration on the
cracking of Type 310 at 330 C and obtained the tesults of
Figure 76 showing that the concentration of NaOH below
which cracking would not occur is about 0.1 to 1%14
Cracks were intergranular and transgranular with the latter
predominating. Picket et al investigated the cracking of
Type 304 and found similar trends.'' Snowden' used
Type 347 to investigate the effects of concentration, stress,
temperature and the composition of NaOH with KOH. His
results are smmarized in Table 20. In general, NaOH
appears to be about twice as aggressive as KOH. This same
trend was noted by Coriou and Grall,*'' The concen-
tration dependence of Snowden's work appears to agree
with that of Sidorov and Ryabchenkov. The cracking of all
specimens showed no prior susceptibility to sensitization.
Snowden also investigated the effect of dewpoint and
superheat environments on the cracking of contaminated
Type 347 in a temperature range of 275-350 C. The
contamination was applied by immersing specimens in a
30% solution. The most ignificant finding of these experi-
ments was the shifting in mode of cracking. Contrary to the
results of solution tests described in Table 20, the cracking
for the NaOH contaminated solutions was predominantly
transgranular. Specimens contaminated with KOH cracked
intergranularly below 380 C (the melting point of KOH)
and transgranularly above. Figure 77 shows typical inter-
granular and transgranular cracks from the work of
Snowden.
Wheeler and Howelly'' investigated the effect of
NaOH concentration on the cracking of Type 347 in liquid
sodium and water environmentt at 360-450 C. Oxygen was
purposely excluded. Their results are shown in Table 21.
Cracking in very high caustic concentrations at 399 C and
362 C appears to be stifled; whereas cracking was observed
when the concentration reaches 100%. All cracking in this
study was transgranular.
The effect of LiOH on the cracking of Type 347 was
studied by Pement using cold formed bellows
specimens,! ' Concentrations were varied from 1Q'' to 5
molar and specimens were tested at 160, 289, and 315 C.
Oxygen was purposely excluded from the experiments.
Cracking occurred at all three temperatures; an 0.1 molar
concentration appeared to be the approximate division for
susceptibility with only one crack observed at this concen-
tration. Intergranular cracking was observed in all cases.
Pement states that fhe cracking in LiOH solutions was less
aggressive than in NaDf solutions; and he sggests that this
may result from the lower ionization and lower solubility
of the LlOH.
The effect of additions to caustic solutions has been
investigated. Siderov and Ryabchenkov studied the effect
of NaCl additions to a 3% NsOH solution at 330 C and
found that the cracking was progressively inhibited as the
concentration increased accogiing to the trend in Figur<

Dne approach to the chemical modeling of a
disordered phase is to treat it numerically
as a mixture of discrete component phases,
with individual stabilities. The advantage
of this procedure is that each such component
phase can be treated in simulation as a dis- -
solved solid with a stability that can be re-
lated to an equilibrium aqueous composition.
The methodology of Tardy and Garrels (1974)
it a well-known procedure for the estimation
of the stabilities of layer silicates that
may be applicable to the less ordered prod-
ucts of glass dissolution. They showed that
for the layer silicate structure, the compo-
nent oxides make constant contributions to
the total free energy of the phase. It was
possible to make estimates of their stabil-
ities that were consistent not on ly with
those of composite phases, but with solubil-
ity data, 1.e., the activities of dissolved
species in equilibrated leachates. The free
energies of formation of simp le oxides as
''silicated' components that were determined
in this way are in many cases very different
from their standard state values, reflecting
their degree of bonding. Once detersined,
however, they could simply be added and sub-
tracted to construct other comp lex phases of
similar structures but different stoichio-
metries and previous ly unk nown stabilities.
The concept can be extended to the alteration
products of specific glass compositions at
constant temperature if there is sufficient
regularity in the structures that are formed.
In the present application, we do not exactly
duplicate the Tardy-6arrels approach, since
there is not a comparable set of alteration
product phases known to be of similar struc-
ture and with known thermochemical proper-
ties. For our purposes, this set must
be generated from the reference glass
composition.
The most direct approach is to measure ex-
perimentally the concentrations of dissolved
$pecies. As they approach steady state, the
free energies of reaction computed from the
activity products also become constant. If
the solid composition is also known, the
Overall reaction can be writtenn, and the
value of the composite solid phase free

to estimate the stabilities for silicated
components that are otherwise difficult to

ucts conform to expected silica-alumina aque-
ous reaction behavior, with the titanate and
zirconate phases showing little reaction.
Samples of the Rockwell RSC-S29 ceramic
forms were sealed in gold capsules with
various water compositions (deionized, con-
nate, NBT-6a 8rine) and heated to 200, 300,
and 400C for 7 days (Wite 1982; Freeborn
and White 1984). The reaction products and
solution concentrations were determined. The
general results indicated that the hydrother-
mal conditions accelerated the dissolution
of the nepheline and trace hauyne phase and
caused some corrosion of the perovskite
phase. None of the studies indicated any
dissolution on the primary actinide hosts
phases zirconolite, magnetoplumbite, and
murataite. 0f the radionuclide simulants,
Cs, Sr, la, Ce, 0, and Th, in the ceramic
form only U and Cs were found in measurable
quantities in solution. The observed solu-
tion concentrations in the T day tests are
listed in Tables C.l, C.8, and C.9. Note
that the blank values for the elements have
not been subtracted.
Reaction products were observable in the
various tests by RD and SEM/EDS. The re-
sults are sumarized in Table C.10. In the
deionized water tests at 200'C small crystals
of a wairakite-type phase were observed and
some clay-like material. At 300C the crys-
tallization reactions were enhanced and well-
formed crystals of analcime, containing Cs,
were observed. In addition there was a phase
with micaceous habit composed of Ca, Al, and
Si. The EDS analysis indicates the phases
to be of the anorthite or margarite type.
At 400'C the only identified product was a
plagioclase feldspar, formed from the decom-
position of the analcime phase. There were
also very small crystallites present, possi-

The fission products that form solid solutions with the
heavy-metal oxides include yttrium, the rare earths, the
portion of the zirconium not contained in the alkaline earth

molybdenum present as oxide, The last three are tetravalent
ions that form oxides of the general formula MO4, which
has the same fluorite structure as the actinide oxides.
Although the stable crystallographic form of yttrium and
the rare earths in their pure state is the sesquioxide M4 O 4,
they assume the fluorite structure of the host lattice when
dissolved in UO4. Figure 12.8 shows that the difference in

Equation 16.97 represents Nabarro--Herring diffusional
creep (Eq. 16.27). The observed linear stress dependence is
also exhibited by Coble's gram-boundary creep formula
(Eq. 16.47) or Gifkins' grain-boundary sliding model
(Eq. 16.95), but the gran-size dependence of the latter two
mechantsms are d'' and d''. respectively, Beyond the
transition stress, 0;,, the creep rate becomes independent of
grain size and increases as the 4th or 5th power of the
applied stress. These features of the creep rate are con-
sistent with the dislocation climb-annihilation model of
creep (Sec. 16.7).
In principle, the total creep rate should be expressed as
the sum of a,tr and ag, but the difference in the
exponents of the stress in the two models is so large that
the transition region w here both modes contribute more or
less eq ually to the total creep rate is quite narrow. It is
sufficient to assume that the transition occurs dis-
continuously at a stress 0;,, Assuming that the activation

The importance of the redistribution process should be self-evident, as it
determines the amount of water retained at various times by the different
depth zones in the soil profile and hence can affect the water economy of
plants. The rate and duration of downward flow during redistribution deter-
mine the effective soil water storage, a property that is vitally important,
particularly in relatively dry regions, where water supply is infrequent and
plants must rely for long periods on the unreplenished reservoir of water
within the rooting zone. Even in relatively humid regions, where the water
supply by precipitation would seem to be sufficient, inadequate soil moisture
storage can deprive the crops to be grown of a major portion of the water
supply and can cause crop failure. Finally, the redistribution process is
important because it often determines how much water will flow through the
root zone (rather than be detained, or temporarily stored, within it) and
hence how much leaching of solutes will take place.
As we shall explain more fully in the sections to follow, soil-water storage
is generally not a fixed quantity or a static property but a dynamic phe-
nomenon, determined by the time-variable rates of soil-water inflow to, and
outflow from, the relevant soil volume.
Internal Drainage in Thoroughly Wetted Profiles
We have already made a distinction between the postinfiltration movement
of soil water in cases where a groundwater table is present fairly close to the
soil surface (i.e., at a depth not exceeding a few meters) and in cases where
groundwater is either nonexistent or too deep to affect the state and move-
ment of soil moisture in the root zone.
At the groundwater table, also called the phreatic surface, soil water is at
atmospheric pressure. Beneath this level the hydrostatic pressure exceeds
atmospheric pressure, while above this level soil water is under suction.
Internal drainage in the presence of a water table tends to a state of equilib-
rium, in which the suction at each point corresponds to its height above the
free water level. The downward drainage flux decreases as the hydraulic
gradient decreases, both approaching zero in time (provided, of course, there
is no further addition of water by another episode of infiltration, or abstrac-
tion of water by evapotranspiration-processes which would prevent the
attainment of static equilibrium). At equilibrium, if attainable, soil wetness
would increase in depth to a value of saturation just above the water table, a
depth distribution which would mirror the soil moisture characteristic curve.
Phenomena involving falling water tables and groundwater drainage will be
treated in our next chapter.
In the present section, we wish to concentrate upon the internal drainage
of profiles initially wetted to near saturation throughout their depth. We
Common practice in irrigation is to measure the total water content of
the root zone just prior to an irrigation, and to supply the amount of water
necessary to replenish the soil reservoir to some maximal water content,
generally taken to be the ''field capacity.'' Some ecologists and irrigationists
have tended to assume that the deficit of soil moisture which develops
between rains or irrigations is due to evapotranspiration only, thus dis-
regarding the amount of water which may flow through the bottom of the
root zone, either downward or upward. This flow is not always negligible
and often constitutes a tenth or more of the total water balance (Robins
et al., 1954; Nixon and Lawless, 1960; Rose and Stern, 1967a, b).
It should be obvious that measurement of root-zone or subsoil water
content by itself cannot tell us the rate and direction of soil-water movement
(van Bavel et al., 1968a, b). Even if the water content at a given depth
remains constant, we cannot conclude that the water there is immobile,
since it might be moving steadily through that depth. Tensiometric mea-
surements can, however, indicate the directions and magnitudes of the
hydraulic gradients through the profile (Richards, 1965) and allow us to
compute the fluxes from knowledge of the hydraulic conductivity versus
suction or wetness for the particular soil. More direct measurements of the
deep percolation component of the field water balance may eventually
become possible with the development of water flux meters (Cary, 1968).
Such devices have not yet proven to be practical, however.
The most direct method for measurement of the field water balance is
by use of lysimeters (van Bavel and Myers, 1962; Pruitt and Angus, 1960;
King et al., 1956; Pelton, 1961; Mcllroy and Angus, 1963; Forsgate et al.,
1965; Rose et al., 1966; Harrold, 1966; Black et al., 1968; Hillel et al.,
1969). These are generally large containers of soil, set in the field to repre-
sent the prevailing soil and climatic conditions and allowing more accurate
measurement of physical processes than can be carried out in the open
field. From the standpoint of the field water balance, the most efficient
lysimeters are those equipped with a weighing device and a drainage system,
which together allow continuous measurement of both evapotranspiration
and percolation. Lysimeters may not provide a reliable measurement of
the field water balance, however, when the soil or above-ground conditions
of the lysimeter differ markedly from those of the field itself.

complex interplay of rates of biological uptake and loss, together with radioactive decay in the
many organs and tissues that mght determne an ALI. and it would be prudent to consider
carefully each separate case. In fact, relevant data are scarce but the followng examples wll
serve to dlustrate the nature of the problem.
From constderations of water balance, the mean life of water in the body is about 14 days
for adults and 6 days for mfants aged 6 months iICRP, 1975) and that of the long-lived
radonuclide ttium tn the form of tritiated water w1ll have simlar values. In consequence, the
committed dose equIvalent to body tissues from unit intake of tritium as titiated water will be
only about four times greater for such tnfants than for adults, rather than the ten times greater
factor derved above that would be expected on the basis of ther differences in mass alone.
Smlarly, as a consequence of the more rapid turnover of the long-lived caesium-137 in people
of smaller mass (Cryer and Baverstock, 1972), the committed dose equivalent in body tissues
from umt mtake of the radionuchide 1s only about l.5 times greater for the 6-month infant than 1t
1s for adults (Medcal Research C ouncl. 1975).
The mean lfe of iodine n the thyrod also increases with age, but this may be accompanied by
a small decrease In the uptake nto the gland from the blood, (Medical Research Council, 1975;
UNSCEAR, 1977: Dunnmg and Schwarz, 1981: Stather and Greenhalgh, 1983). For the
relatively short-lived radonucltde odne-131, differences in biological turnover are of little
consequence because its rate of loss from the thyroid is dominated by radioactive decay and Its
mean life in that organ is therefore about the same at all ages. In consequence, the committed
dose equvalent to the thyrod per unt intake of iodine-131 is about ten times greater for the
nfant aged 6 months than it s for adults (Medical Research Council, 1975), reflecting ther
approxmately 10-fold difference n thyroid mass. However, for the very long-lived iodine-129,
the more rapid bological turnover n young people tends to offset ther smaller mass, and the
commtted dose equivalent to the thyroid per unt intake of iodine-129 for the 6-month child is
only about twce that for adults (UNSCEAR, 1977)
Papworth and Vennart (1973) and Leggett et al. (1982) have described how the uptake of
strontium into bone and 1ts retention therein vates wIth age. The former authors have gIven
values for the commtted dose equivalent in red bone marrow and on bone surfaces from unt
intake of dietary strontium-90 and strontium-89. For the long-lived strontium-90, the value for
a b-month nfant 1s about five times the adult value, but for the much shorter-lived strontium-89
thecorresponding ratio lies n the range 20-40, the actual value depending on the model used for
the dosiumetry of the radionuclide in bone. There may be additional contributions to the
comrmtted effective dose equvalent from other organs and tissues for which the factors mght be
dfferent.
Chemical Form
Values of AlLI given in ICRP Publication 30 are usually appropriate to those chemical
compounds of a radionuclide that are most likely to be encountered at a place of work.
Compounds of the same radionuclide found in the environment or in food may be metabolized
differently. The consequent changes in values of committed effective dose equivalent have to be
considered very carefully. For example, increased absorption of a radionuclide from the
gastrointestinal tract into the blood will decrease the committed dose equivalent to the lower
part of the tract, but increase the doses in other tissues of the body; such increases are most
marked when radioactive decay is small during the time taken for transfer from the
gastrontestinal system to the other organs and tissues.
It is known that absorption of some elements from the gastrointestinal system is increased in
new-born anmals of several species by factors up to 100 for compounds that are very poorly

isolated in their areal distribution to pluglike bodies with somewhat
variable margins and diameters. Internally, domes tend to be
structurally more complex (in places almost 'homogenized''), but not on
their tops and borders, where extensive dissolution has generally
occurred. Also, adjacent strata penetrated by domes tend to be faulte d
and folded in a complex manner, making their physical continuity and
effects on water flow more difficult to characterize. This makes the
prediction of radionuclide transport less certain. Fluid inclusions in
domal salt tend to be smaller and lower in total volume than those in
bedded salt that has not been subjected to as much pressure and
compactive force. However, because of the very high thermal
conductivity of salt, heat from depth is focused upward through salt
domes. Thus, temperatures are generally higher in the upper parts of
buried domes, and water contents are much lower relative to bedded salts
and other rocks at similar depths. Up-warped and faulted sedimentary
strata on the margins and tops of salt domes are especially attractive
for oil and gas exploration, and their hydrology is more complicated and
uncertain. Domes are also attractive as a source of nearly pure rock
salt, as sites of deposits of elemental sulfur formed by reduction of
calcium sulfate on the dome margins, and as sites for underground
excavations for storing oil, gas, and other fluids.
Domes are limited in number and easy to locate, making them more
likely targets for future human intrusion. Because they penetrate
various water-yielding sedimentary rocks to great depths, they are
subject to dissolution near their margins and may be surrounded by both
potable water at shallow depths and more mineralized groundwater at
greater depths. Their locations near the Gulf Coast are favorable in
that any minor amounts of radionuclides transported in highly saline
groundwater must be greatly diluted at shallow levels before becoming
potable or will be discharged directly into the sea for ultimate
dilution. Despite the dynamic piercement origin of salt domes, various
lines of evidence document their present structural stability.
Long-term future changes in sea level may alter details of groundwater
flow systems operating in enclosing coastal plain aquifers by increasing
or decreasing path lengths and water velocities, but the consequences of
s uch possible changes can be adequately bounded.

constitute only a small percentage of the physically similar rocks

States near the surface and at shallow depths, especially in
tectonically stable areas and in the cores of many mountain ranges.

nenu sedimentary deposits by correlating
their deposition with marine isotopic rec-
ords of global ice volume requires an as-
sumption that the largest fluctuations in
middle-latitude hydrologic regimes were re-
lated to and in phase with the growth and
waning of high-latitude ice sheets. Evi-
dence from a long record of lake fluctua-
tions in a closed basin east of the southern
Sierra Nevada suggests that this assump-
tion is invalid and that the largest shifts in
hydrologic regimes were caused by other
phenomena that produced changes every
several hundred thousand years. Those
data also show that although some regimes
allowed lake levels to fluctuate, with cycle
lengths having periodicities like those that
characterized high-latitude ice-sheet histo-
ries, suggesting that middle-latitude cli-
matic cycles were produced by them, other
regimes were inherently so wet or dry that
those climatic cycles produced no variation
in lake sedimentation, suggesting that the
magnitudes of extreme regimes exceeded
those of the shorter cycles. Some of the

INTRODUCTION
The mathematical analysis of mass transport in groundwa-
ter systems has been an accepted technique for more than 10
years. In almost every case the dispersion-convection equation
forms the theoretical basis for a wide variety of predictive
mathematical models.
Conventional practice in the application of the models in-
variably involves a simple scaling-up of the porous medium
dispersivity value from the very small values observed in col-
umn experiments to the much larger values calculated from
field trials. There is increasing evidence to suggest that the use
of large dispersivity values associated with uniform hydraulic
conductivity fields is an inappropriate basis for describing
transport in geological systems. The main issue is that mod-
eling large-scale dispersion as a diffusion phenomenon is an
unsubstantiated approximation to what is a different and
more complex phenomenon.
Stallman [1972] considered this deficiency of the transport
theory to be one of the most important limitations in the pre-
dictive evaluation of field problems. Gillham et al. [1975]
pointed out the problem of defining a unique dispersivity be-
cause the value commonly increases with distance from a
point source as the transported mass encounters successively
larger scales of heterogeneity. In addition to these essentially
philosophical arguments there are demonstrated cases where
the diffusion model can be shown to be inadequate. For ex-
ample, Simpson [1978] used a set of simple experiments to il-
lustrate how the use of a large dispersivity value will cause the
upstream migration of a tracer from a source to be over-
estimated. Using a theoretical approach, Schwartz [1977] ex-
plained how the dispersivity coefficient is not uniquely de-
fined and could not be considered as a characteristic
parameter for some porous media. All these arguments, how-
ever, are equivocal and do not clearly indicate the nature of
the problems resulting from extending the diffusion-based
model of dispersion to large systems.
The classical statistical model of microscopic dispersion
considers the position of individual tracer particles in a flow
field to be determined by the ever changing velocity field at
the microscopic scale. Because individual particles of the en-
semble moving through the medium follow different paths,
each encounters slightly different flow conditions [Bear, 1972].
On the basis of the central limit theorem it can be shown that
if the travel time for an individual tracer particle becomes
much larger than the time interval during which its successive
velocities are still correlated, then the probability distribution
of its total displacement should be normal [Bear, 1972]. Appli-
cation of the ergodic principle allows it to be concluded that
the spatial distribution of the ensemble will also be normal.
It-is this tendency for the cloud of tracer particles to con-
verge to a normal distribution and to spread with a variance
that is proportional to time that makes it possible to model
mass transport as a diffusional process.
One purpose of this paper is to describe a stochastic mod-
eling concept that casts macroscopic dispersion as a process
related to the spatial heterogeneity in hydraulic conductivity.
This model represents a realistic analog of the actual process
and does not require the use of large dispersivity values to
generate macroscopic dispersion. Thus limitations which may
be inherent in the conventional treatment are overcome. The
stochastic approach takes account of the spatial variability of
the flow parameters and the inability to describe a hetero-
geneous conductivity distribution exactly. Model output is in
the form of probability distributions which reflect the uncer-
tainty inherent in prediction.
The use of large dispersivity values to model geological sys-
tems implicitly assumes that the microscopic theories apply to
larger systems. A second objective of this paper is to test this
3sSumption and determine whether the commonly accepted
>quivalence between column-scale and field-scale transport is

seems apparent that the Precambrian sedimentary rock
units and the Tertiary rocks have not yet been fully identi-
fied and described. In addition, the detailed physical strati-
graphy and facies relationships in the Upper Ordovician,
Silurian, Late Devonian (Frasnian especially), and, to a
lesser extent, the Late Mississippian through Permian
sequences, are poorly known. The most important ad-
vances in Great Basin stratigraphy, however, may be ex-
pected from biostratigraphic study. Most of the fossils
found in the Great Basin have not yet been described or
figured and, although progress has been made, satisfactory
biostratigraphic zonation cannot be established without
adequate systematic description of the fossils involved.
Members of the Eastern Nevada Geological Society,
led by E, H. Phelps, in about 1960 began thinking of com-
piling a new correlation chart for the Great Basin Area as
a ''ten year'' progress report following their original chart
of 1953 (Easton, 1953). Early in 1961, a committee of
geologists working in the Great Basin was organized for this
purpose under the chairmanship of J. C. Osmond. Subse-
quently, in September, 1961, Osmond was succeeded by
E. H. Phelps and, finally, R. LL Langenheim assumed res-
ponsibility in January, 1962. In 1969 E. R. Larson assumed
the responsibility for the final phases of publication. Ten
others, serving as committee members during all or part
of the time during which the chart was in preparation, have
compiled data for one or more localities treated in the
chart, These men are D. H. Adair, J. P. Albers, D. M. Blue,
W. H. Easton, E. R. Larson, V. E. McMath, D. C. Noble,
A. F. Sanborn, J. H. Stewart, and B. W. Troxell. R. J.
Roberts also served as a committee member, contributing
much personal data and knowledge and also arranging for
assistance by many U. S. Geological Survey personnel work-
ing in the area. In addition to the committee members,
specialists were asked to review correlations for rocks of
specific ages or to review treatment of areas in which they
had significant experience. Cambrian correlations were ex-
tensively criticized and evaluated by A. R. Palmer; R. J.
Ross checked the Ordovician presentation; A. J. Boucot of-
fered comments on Silurian correlations; R. H. Waines thor-
oughly revised and amplified coverage of Devonian rocks;
and N. J. Silberling provided much information on the
Triassic System. Others offering critical assistance, chiefly
in regard to areas of which they have detailed knowledge,
include H. L. Bauer, D. A. Brew, R. L. Christiansen,

its petrography to the intracaldera tuffs and rhyolites of ]
Area 20. The xenolithic inclusions of intracaldera Grouse ]

indicate a source within the Silent Canyon caldera. The ]
total erupted volume of the Stockade Wash was about ]
20-40 km (5-10 mi%). Recurrent minor subsidences ]

accumulated inside the caldera, with the result that the ]
underlying Crater Flat Tuff was eventually downdropped ]
more than 2 km (diagram 2, fig. 26).

caldera of unknown extent. Only a small segment of the ]

Timber Mountain caldera, to be about 25 km (15 mi) in ]

of the Paintbrush Tuff, he Topopah Spring, was erupted ]
about 13 m.y. ago with a total volume of about 250 km*(60 ]
mi%). Recurrent subsidence within the cauldron followed ]
eruption of the Topopah Spring Member of the Paint- ]
brush Tuff, and probably a minor collapse followed the ]
eruption of the Pah Canyon and Yucca Mountain ]
Members. Within the caldera they accumulated to several ]
times their thickness outside the caldera. The Tiva ]
Canyon Member, representing the climactic eruption in ]
the evolution of the Claim Canyon cauldron, flowed out ]
about 12.5 m.y, ago mainly to the west of the Claim ]
Canyon cauldron.The tuff of Chocolate Mountain, which ]
is about 1,000 m (3,300 ft) thick, was erupted as a late [
quartz latitic phase of the Tiva Canyon and was confined ]
within the Claim Canyon cauldron, suggesting that ]
collapse was occurring during its eruption, although ]
Christiansen and others (1976) infer a collapse to the west ]
of the site of Oasis Valley. Tuff breccia, similar petro- ]
graphically to the Tiva Canyon, was generated at vents ]
along or near the wall of the Claim Canyon cauldron ]
segment. The volume of the Tiva Canyon, including the ]
intracauldron tuff of Chocolate Mountain, may have ]
totaled as much as 1,000 km* (250 mi'). The youngest
separate cooling unit of the Paintbrush, the tuff of Pinyon
Pass, followed very soon after the Tiva Canyon was
confined to the newly formed caldera.
After eruption of the ash-flow sheets of the Paintbrush
Tuff and after the formation of the caldera, intricate
faulting occurred within the Paintbrush cauldron, similar
to that on Timber Mountain, The fault pattern is inter-
preted by the present authors (see also Christiansen and
others, 1976) as owing to magmatic resurgence with uplift
of the cauldron block from its former subsided position
(diagram 4, fig. 226). The entire Paintbrush cauldron later
participated in a broad magmatic doming preliminary to
the culminating stages of volcanism-the eruption of ash-
flow sheets of uhe Timber Mountain Tuff. Quartz-bearing
pre-Rainier Mesa rhyolite lavas were extruded from
fractures probably related to this broad doming (diagram
5, fig. 26). Gas-charged silicic rhyolitic magma
accumulated at the top of the domical chamber, and tuffs
were assimilated from the roof as crystallization proceeded
lower in the chamber.
The Timber Mountain Tuff chapter of the caldera
complex began 11.3 m.y. ago with eruption of the
voluminous Rainier Mesa Member from the central part of
the broad dome that had formed over the magma chamber.
The domed roof over the magma chamber ruptured
sufficiently to cause a considerable reduction of pressure
and to trigger vesiculation which greatly increased the
volume of the gas-charged magma escaping through
fissures. As the eruption proceeded, collapse of the roof
occurred, and the Rainier Mesa accumulated to a greater
thickness inside the subsidence area than outside (diagram
6, fig. 26). As the caldera deepened with continuing
eruption a more crystal-rich, but less gas-charged, quartz
latitic magma was tapped, whose eruptions were largely
confined within the caldera. Poorly sorted debris flows
containing large blocks of welded tuff and lava slid off the
newly formed oversteepened caldera walls and inter-
tongued with the upper quartz latitic part of the Rainier
Mesa Member. A total volume of about 1,200 km(300 mi')
of tuff had been extruded by this time, and a large volcano-
tectonic depression formed, including the Timber
Mountain caldera and probably the adjacent Oasis Valley
caldera segment. There is little evidence to indicate
whether or not there was central resurgent doming of the
] Rainier Mesa Member within this depression, except for
] the westward-tilted block in the Transvaal Hills west of
] Timber Mountain caldera.
] During the brief interval between the eruptions of the
] Rainier Mesa Member and Ammonia Tanks Members of
] the Timber Mountain Tuff (11.5-11,1 m.y,), pre-
] Ammonia Tanks rhyolite lavas were extruded within the
] caldera that had resulted from the Rainier Mesa eruptions
] (diagram 7, fig. 28).
] The Ammonia Tanks Member of the Timber Mountain
] Tuff was erupted ll.1 m.y, ago. Nearly half its total
] volume of 900 km*(230 mi')probably accumulated within
] a concomitantly subsiding caldera, as evidenced by the fact

] with the tuff. This episode of cauldron subsidence of

] what smaller than the Rainier Mesa collapse area

not distinctly shown on the Variable Den-
sity/Signature Logs even when the casing signal is
weak, it signifies a poor bond between cement and for-
mation. The high acoustic attenuation may also be
caused by formations like soft shales, unconsolidated
gas sands, etc. The eccentered tool or the presence of
gas in mud would also result in weak formation signal
amplitudes.
Presence of even a very small gap between the cas-
ing and cement may erroneously indicate a poor ce-
ment bond on the compressional wave amplitude
curve. Such a microannulus or microseparation is
caused by one or more factors, such as holding
pressure in the casing after cementation, thermal ex-
pansion of the pipe during cement setting, thermal
contraction due to circulation of cooler fluids before
running the ACBL, and oil/grease on the external sur-
face of the casing. Such a condition may be suspected
when both casing as well as formation signals are
moderately high. By the application of pressure during
measurement, the ACBL may be repeated over zones
of interest to confirm the presence of the micro-
annulus. If a significant reduction in the casing signal
amplitude is observed, the entire log should be run
under pressure, because a microannulus usually pro-
vides a hydraulic seal, preventing fluid movement.
SUMMARY
The Dresser Atlas Borehole Compensated
Acoustilogis designed to record 2t,, the specific com-
pressional wave travel time in formations. The
measurements are unaffected by the borehole and
have excellent vertical definition. In clean and con-
solidated formations, the linear time-average relation-
ship yields realistic porosity values. In uncompacted
formations, Wyllie's formula provides abnormally
high values of porosity, which necessitates application
of corrections for lack of compaction. Presence of
shale and/or hydrocarbons also tends to increase
specific acoustic times, and must be corrected. Porosi-
ty derived from acoustic measurements in fractured or
vuggy carbonates is too low, reflecting only the
homogeneous porosity. By combining data from the
Density and Neutron Logs, the BHC Acoustilog can
be used for the determination of lithology and the esti-
mation of secondary porosity in carbonate rocks. The
Acoustilog is very helpful in correlation of strata and
seismic interpretation. Abnormal formation pressures
can be predicted by a study of 2St in shales.
Acoustic logging systems for measurements other
than Ct are available. Shear wave travel times provide
the basis for determining rock mechanical properties.
Problems of sand production and fracturability of
formations can be studied. Acoustic amplitude logs
are used in open holes for fracture identification and
The heat flow, normally measured in the upper l% of the crust, pro-
vides only a boundary condition from which we should like to determine
the thermal regime of the crust, i.e., to determine q (z) throughout the
entire crust. This requires a knowledge of how the terms on the right
side of (3) vary throughout the crust. To provide meaningful constraints
on these terms we must obtain insight into the physical processes that
they represent. Interpretations of the crustal regime generally repre-
sent attempts to integrate (3) with simplifications believed to be
appropriate for specific regions.
In our discussion, A will represent heat generated by radioactive
decay of U, Th, and '?K, elements present in minute amounts in crustal
rocks. The process goes on steadily, irrespective of what else might be
happening in the earth. The second term on the right in (3) represents
effects of relative vertical movement of crustal (and upper mantle)
masses; they may be solid blocks moving along faults or magmatic and
aqueous fluids generally moving through fractures created by faulting or
through pore spaces. As these movements are generally intermittent or
short-lived, they generate transient disturbances represented by the
last term in (3). Surface indicators of these mass movements are earth-
quakes, young volcanic rocks, and hot springs, which are shown with the
heat flow distribution in Figures 3, 7, and 8. These manifestations are
generally concentrated in the western regions of anomalously high heat
flow, suggesting that the anomalies there are due primarily to convec-
tion and associated transients (i.e., to effects of the last two terms
in (3)). The manifestations are rare in regions of low heat flow in the
Sierra Nevada and the eastern half of the United States, and the crustal
ASSESSING PALEOENVIRONMENTAL
RECONSTRUCTIONS
Packrat-midden analysis affords a high-resolution view
of the environmental history of the Nevada Test Site and
vicinity. However, potential errors and unknown vari-
ables that exist should be considered. Errors could be
introduced in estimating modern climates at the fossil
sites, in reconstructing past vegetation, or in extrapolat-
ing climatic parameters from reconstructions. Retrodictive
studies, such as this one, describe phenomena that no
longer exist; conclusions derived from such analyses
cannot be tested through observation. However, they
can be tested by attempts to replicate the fossil record
and by application of proposed paleoclimatic parameters
to models of physical systems, such as pluvial lakes and
cryogenic deposits.
ACCURACY OF REPRESENTATION AND
GENERAL ANALOGS
Plant-macrofossil assemblages from ancient packrat
middens possess distinctive characteristics that permit
identification of specific vegetation types. Analyses of
modern middens in this study, and those performed by
Cole (1981, p. 36-41; 1982), indicate that sufficient fidelity
exists in the midden-vegetation relationship to permit
accurate reconstruction to at least the community-type
level (table 1). The possibility that first-order errors have
been made in this study (such as reconstruction of juni-
per woodland when ponderosa-pine forest was actually
present) is remote. Errors may exist in second-order
reconstructions of specific plant associations (table 1),
but this also is unlikely. Analyses of modern packrat
middens show that plant species that are abundant or
common in nearby vegetation are well-represented in the
assemblages. Therefore, it is unlikely that a macrofossil
assemblage would be interpreted as representing, say, a
juniper-shrub woodland, when a pinyon-juniper wood-
land was actually present. Studies of modern middens
thus far have failed to demonstrate consistent biases
in foraging behavior of packrats that would invalidate
the conclusions presented here. These paleoecological
reconstructions usually are based on multiple macrofos-
sil assemblages controlled by multiple radiocarbon dates.
Non-representative assemblages may be sampled on
occasion, but these would have little effect on paleoeco-
logical reconstructions based on many samples.
Diverse bioclimatic regions of the western United States
provide a range of general analogs to the fossil records
that are used to infer the nature of late uaternary
climates. Use of such analogs provides an effective paleo-
environmental tool, even though exact analogs between
vegetation and environments of the late Pleistocene and
those of today probably do not exist (Hare, 1976; Birks,
1981). Thus, the climate that existed at the time when
xerophytic juniper woodland was widespread is assumed
to have been more similar to that of current dry wood-
land than to that of less similar vegetation types in
existence now. There are no logical alternatives to the
assertion that, because the late Wisconsin vegetation of
the Nevada Test Site region resembled current vegeta-
tion of northern Nevada, the past climate probably was
more similar to the present climate of that area than any
other area.
The fossil record provides evidence for various paleo-
ecological phenomena which, in turn, are used to recon-
struct different aspects of the past climate. Among the
most important used in this study are values of the
relative vertical displacement of individual species and
the inferred absence of particular taxa from the region
during the late Wisconsin.
ELEVATIONAL DISPLAGEMENT
Estimates of minimum elevational displacement of
limber pine and Utah juniper (table 8) are based on a
large data set. Contributing environmental variables,
such as aspect, exposure, and substrate, were considered
in the calculation of displacement estimates (Spaulding,
1981, p. 166-171). Wells (1977, p. 238)has cautioned that
a vertical uncertainty of 100 m may exist in such estimates,
because of the possibility of downslope transport of plant
fragments from higher elevations. This is balanced, to
some extent, by the probability that the lowest fossil
record of a particular species does not reflect the lowest
elevation that it attained. Neither consideration should
seriously affect the validity of minimum estimates. For
example, the three lowest fossil records of limber pine on
calcareous substrate in the region are within 50-m eleva-
tion of each other and are from different sites (Spaulding,
1981, table 35). At one of these sites, Basin Canyon-1 at
an elevation of 1,635 m in the Sheep Range (Spaulding,
1981, p. 136-140), limber pine is well represented in the
macrofossil assemblages. It is improbable that these
fossils represent downslope transport, because: (1)They
are present in quantity; (2) the locality does not possess
extreme topographic relief (Spaulding, 1981, fig. 20);
and (3) two other middens from a different locality pro-
vide similar elevational records.
Occurrence of limber pine and Utah juniper far below
their lowest modern populations is attributed to cooler
summers during the late Wisconsin. These two taxa
were chosen as indicator species of summer tempera-
tures because they are the most xerophytic arboreal taxa
in present subalpine (limber pine) and woodland (Utah
juniper) vegetation. The assumption is made that their
downward displacement primarily was due to increased
slopes is evident. Furthermore, the range of Mojave prickleleaf
(Hecastocleis sbockleyi Gray) was apparently attenuated on north-
ern slopes during the full glacial, while Forsellesia pungens Heller
occurred on both mesic and xeric exposures.
Similar phenomena have been documented in the Grand Canyon
(Cole, 1981) as well as in the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts.
Plants presently restricted to washes in the low deserts, such as
catclaw acaca (Alcacia greggii Gray), occurred on rocky slopes dur
ing the Wisconsin (Van Devender, 1973; Van Devender and
Spaulding, 1979). Van Devender and Riskind (1979) have recorded
the presence of woodland on limestone during the late glacial in the
Hueco Mountains of western Texas. These mesophytic plants persist
in the area to this day but are restricted to outcrops of syenite. The
obtained, they were recorded over relatively long intervals. Comparisons with
core values such as shown in Figures 2 and 3 were not appropriate because
of the large volumes of rock involved. However, full-wave acoustic logs permit
examination of shear velocities and dynamic moduli on a much smaller scale.
This enables comparisons of small-interval in situ readings with core values
obtained in the laboratory.
Although data obtained from the 3-D log yield sufficient information on
elastic constants without resorting to logs other than density, it is desirable
for several reasons to attempt to relate these data to another log or less elabo-
rate combination of logs. This arises from the difficulty at times in obtaining
a shear velocity. To obtain the dynamic moduli, a shear velocity is needed.
Occasionally in the borehole the attenuation characteristics of the medium are
such that a shear wave is hard to discern on a 3-D log. In addition, the density
log is not always easily obtained due to borehole effects.
Of the three variables - shear and compressional wave velocity and den-
sity - required to calculate dynamic moduli, the measurement most easily

It is possible to use the regression models to estimate the magnitude, as a function
of depth, that could be expected to be exceeded in a given proportion (1 - o) of
eruptive volumes, vesicularity, and degree of
chemical differentiation decreased.
Pyroclastic flows were first observed shortly after
noon on May 18; resulting deposits extend as much as
8 km from the vent, cover an area of about 15 km',
and have a bulk volume of about 0.2 km? (Rowley
and others). The deposits form a fan-like pattern of
sheets, tongues, and lobes of mostly poorly sorted
ash and clasts of pumice and dense dacite. Succes-
sively younger 1980 pyroclastic-fiow deposits, in gen-
eral, cover progressively smaller areas and have
smaller volumes. The flows formed along with devel-
opment of large vertical ash columns. Most pyro-
clastic flows originated when bulbous masses of ash,
lapilli, and blocks rose only a short distance above
the inner crater before spreading laterally to the
north, but some flows were observed to result from
gravitational collapse of parts of an accompanying
vertical ash column.
Morphologic and rheologic measurements on pyro-
clastic-flow deposits of July 22 and August 7 indicate
that the flows moved as non-Newtonian fluids, most
readily modelled as Bingham plastics (Wilson and
Head). Reverse grading of coarse, low-density
pumice clasts in marginal levee deposits is interpreted
as the consequence of briefly increased fluidization,
related to interaction between the flow and surround-
ing air at the time of emplacement.
Petrographic and textural studies indicate that all
1980 pyroclastic-flow deposits consist mainly of
juvenile dacite, containing plagioclase, hypersthene,
horrnblende, and Fe-Ti-oxide phenocrysts in a vesic-
ular glassy matrix (Kuntz and others). In general, suc-
cessively younger deposits show increasing modal
proportions of plagioclase, hypersthene, and Fe-Ti-
oxide phenocrysts, increasing average anorthite con-
tent of plagioclase, increasing phenocryst:glass ratios,
and decreasing porosity. These relations suggest that
successive eruptions have tapped deeper levels in a
compositionally zoned magma chamber, have pro-
gressively depleted the magma of volatiles, and have
been characterized by decreased amounts of vesicula-
tion and gas thrust.
ANALYSIS OF
POTENTIAL HA2ZARDS
Predictions of potential eruptions and assessments
of volcanic hazards, based on the past activity of
various volcanoes in the Cascade Range, have been
made over about the past 15 yr for long-range land-
use planning. These assessments postulate kinds,
locations, severity, frequency, and effects of future
eruptions and suggest some possible responses. Such
an assessment for Mount St. Helens was completed in
the mid-1970'e and the report published in 1978.
Because such assessments are for long-range plan-
ning, they differ from day-to-day hazard assessments,
which in addition to past activity consider current in-
formation provided by monitoring. A skeleton array
of seismometers, recently emplaced, picked up the in-
itial earthquakes associated with the 1980 eruptions,
and was expanded to monitor seismic activity
through the rest of the year. Thus, the eruptions
tested predictions of potential eruptions and their
associated hazards, and also the efficacy of seismic
monitoring for a Cascade Range volcano.
After May 18, the new potential hazard created by
debris-avalanche deposits that raised Spirit Lake and
dammed several streams tributary to the North Fork
Toutle River led to stability analysis of the debris-av-
alanche and computer-aided analyses of floods that
could result from its overtopping.
Initial USGS recommendations in response to the
increase in earthquakes at Mount St. Helens (Miller
and others) were based entirely on past eruptive ac-
tivity at the volcano. Access to the volcano was re-
stricted first because of danger from snow avalanches
on the cone itself. As seismic activity increased, ac-
cess to the area around Mount St. Helens was re-
stricted because of the likelihood of eruptions. After
the first eruption, recommendations regarding haz-
ards and appropriate responses were based not only
on the record of past activity, but also on day-to-day
visual and instrumental monitoring. USGS hazards-
analysis coordinators described ranges of expectable
eruptions, possible responses, and expectable warn-
ings to government officials, private interests, and the
public. Hazards forecasts were generally accurate,
but the magnitude of the massive landslide and
laterally directed blast of May 18 exceeded expecta-
tions. Experiences during the 1980 eruptions em-
phasized the need for a hazards assessment before an
eruption occurs, an extensive monitoring network, an
onsite agency capable of handling emergency situa-
tions, and hazards-assessment personnel familiar with
local geography and land use as well as the eruptive
record.
Some seismometers were in place at and near the
volcano when the March activity began, and the net-
work was immediately expanded when a swarm of
earthquakes followed that of March 20 (Malone and
others). After March 25 frequency and magnitude of
earthquakes leveled off, however, and no further
changes signaled the cataclysmic eruption of May 18.
AFter May 18, a relatively low background of seismic
activity allowed changes to be more readily recog-
nized; the eruptions of June 12 and August 7 were
preceded by increases in level of harmonic tremor,
and eruptions of July 22 and October 16 were pre-
ceded by increased numbers of shallow volcanic
earthquakes. For each of these, the precursors were
recognized and warnings issued at least 2 hr before
the eruption began.
A review of eruption forecasting on a probabilistic
basis, using both evidence from past events and mon-
itoring, is encouraging (Decker). Two approaches are
fruitful-the documentation of past eruptive history
to provide evidence of long-term potential kinds and
frequencies of eruptions, and monitoring to provide
information about eruption potential on a short-term
basis. Some predictions of Mount St. Helens eruptive
events and effects were very successful, including
those for most events of May 18, and of forthcoming
eruptions in June, fuly, August, October, and
December. Eight significant eruptions in 1980 were
preceded by multiple phenomena over periods of
months to hours: false alarms that occurred generally
were based on occurrence of only one precursory-
type phenomenon. Significant improvements are still
needed in judging extents, magnitudes, times, and
locations of coming eruptive events, especially when
seismic activity is high. Gas studies show promise of
predicting times of forthcoming eruptions, and
ground-deformation studies and thermal monitoring
have detected some changes that could be useful for
anticipating specific events.
ARer the May 18 eruption, the huge debris ava-
lanche in the North Fork Toutle River valley raised
the level of Spirit Lake by about 60 m. The debris was
known to contain abundant water and hydrother-
and snow thicknesses where cracks in the glaciers
reveal bedrock below, changes in texture of rock and
ice on the bulge, and differences in snow condition
and runoff.
In order to produce a digital terrain model, the
three-dimensional coordinates digitized during map
compilation were transferred by magnetic tape to the
U.S. Geological Survey Flagstaff Image Processing
Facility. Raster images of the contour lines were made
with a resolution of 5 m per pixel (picture element).
The resulting raster image of contour lines, approx-
imately 2,000 pixels square, was flled in by broad-
ening individual contour lines until they met, and
generating an intermediate contour level at their in-
tersection. This process was repeated until no picture
elements were unassigned, thus generating a full
elevation array on the digital terrain model.
This procedure differs from conventional topo-
graphic mapping in that no hand-editing of any kind
is done to the position of the contour lines. In areas
where the positional uncertainty exceeds the contour
interval, contour lines may actually cross. This prob-
lem is particularly noticeable within large snowfields
that have no identifiable surface features. The digital
terrain model can be cosmetically improved by use of
a 3X 3 pixel (15 m square) low-pass filter that replaces
each pixel with the average of nine pixels in the
original array. This process has no effect in areas of
uniform slope; it tends to subdue the topography
slightly in areas of rapid slope changes, and it is par-
ticularly effective in removing the slope reversals due
to erroneous contour crossing. The preeruption
digital terrain model, filtered in this manner, was
processed to produced a shaded-relief image of the
topography (fig. 79).
As mentioned previously, during the last few days
before May 18, suitable photography could rarely be
obtained without the presence of some atmospheric
obscuration. In order to construct as complete a
digital model as possible for a late date prior to May
18, the digital terrain data for May l6 were used to fll
in the region obscured on May 12; the resulting com-
posite is called the May 12/16 model.
The changes in elevation and thus changes in
volume could be automatically determined by simply
subtracting the digital terrain model for one date from
that of another. From these terrain-difference models,
a map was produced to show the changes from
pre-1980 to May 12/16 (fig. 80). The total volume
change can be computed directly by summing over all
the elements of the elevation-difference array. This
automatic processing of elevation data renders ob-
vious the major topographic variations: the large ap-
parent upward motion of the surface of the upper
Forsyth Glacier, subsidence of the large graben across
the summit area of the mountain, and the northwest
displacement and small vertical change in the Goat
Rocks area. Topographic change between pre-1980
and April 11 and from April 11 to May 12/16 are
shown in figures 81AA and B, respectively. The bulging
of the north side of the mountain and the graben for-
mation at the summit can be seen in both images.
Over the second period, the response of the Forsyth
Glacier to initial oversteepening can be seen as a
relative increase in elevation (actually, largely lateral
motion of a sloping surface) of the lower part of the
glacier.
The general unreliability of control points on the
upper parts of Mount St. Helens resulted in apparent
elevation changes of several meters in areas that
surveying indicated to be stable in April and May
(Lipman, Moore, and Swanson, this volume). In
order to correct for these errors in the photogram-
metric models, the apparent elevation changes were
determined along a line surrounding the area of
definite topographic change (fig. 80). The mean and
standard deviation of the differences between digital
terrain models for this line of about 1,500 points are:

eruption was greater than 50 C, hot enough to result
in leaf death. However, volcanic SO, or droplets of
HSO, may also have played a role in causing leaf
death. Site 1 was closer to the volcanic crater, was
higher in elevation, and was subjected to tempera-
tures nearly 200 C cooler than site 2. Although hot
ejecta were deposited on site 1, this site was at the
southern margin of the eruption cloud and it is in-
ferred from this study that the air temperatures re-
mained relatively cool. Site 2 was 2,400 m lower in
elevation than the crater and 21 km away, but it was
in one main path of the directed blast. The higher air
temperatures at site 2 may have resulted from heated
air, which was trapped and carried between hot ash
particles that were falling and flowing downhill.
Analyses of leaves from additional sites (fig. 185) may
provide further insight into the temperature patterns
in the seared zone of the blast area. These estimates
would be of geological interest and could reveal pat-
terns of heat dispersion from the eruption of May 18.
1980.
250 excavations scattered east to northwest of the
volcano (fig. 353). The total-thickness isopach map of
May 18 units shows a broad northward lobe and a
sharp east-northeast lobe (fig. 355). These lobes are
the deposit from two principal events of May 18: (1) a
directed blast (pyroclastic density flow) that cata-
strophically swept 10-25 km to the north, northwest,
and northeast and an attendant air fall extending
another 30 km outward (Waitt, this volume); and (2)
the vertical eruptive column and other events that
ejected material high enough to enter the east-
northeast windstream. All but roughly 2 cm (layer
A3) of the northward lobe is the direct deposit of the
blast (density-flow) event (layers A1 and A2) (figs.
258, 262 and 263). The east-northeast lobe comprises
four overlapping air-fall units, mostly coarse air-fall
pumice and lithic fragments from the central eruptive
column (unit B). But the four units do not all emanate
from exactly the same source area.
Beyond 5 km from the volcano, there is little local
variation in thickness of the primary air-fall units
within or among nontimbered areas. Near the trunks
of living conifers, however, air-fall material is
somewhat thinner because of outward shedding by
the limbs overhead.

stratigraphic unit at the base of the air-fall sequence,
which beyond 20 km is a sandy silt only millimeters
thick, thickens and coarsens to gravel and sand more

Near the volcano a basal gravel (layer A1) decimeters
rupted transportation, shut down sewage disposal
systems, and caused massive problems of ash removal
and disposal. Table 95 summarizes the relationships
between the various eruptive processes and products
of Mount St. Helens and the types of civil works and
operations impacted.
The growth of communities and development of
other land uses in areas downvalley and downwind
from Mount St. Helens occurred almost entirely after
1857, the time of the last eruption prior to 1980.
During the following 123 yr of volcano inactivity,
communities, highways, bridges, hydroelectric dams
and reservoirs, railroads, and airports were con-
structed in the region, but the possible effects of
future eruptions on these developments was given
little or no thought. This disregard for volcanic erup-
tions in planning new developments has not been
unique to the Mount St. Helens region, but has char-
acterized the entire Cascade Range with its many in-
active but potentially dangerous volcanoes (Crandell
and others, 1979).
This report has described examples of the effects of
various kinds of volcanic events on structures and on
other developments that are vital to the economic
wellbeing of an entire region. Many of these effects

vhich have substantial nonisotropic components (Press and Archambeau, 1962;
Toksoz et al., 1964; Toksoz and Kehrer, 1971; among others). The surface-wave
)bservations provide the evidence which is most commonly cited for this source
asymmetry. For example, for the explosion GREELEY, the observed ratio of the
lLove to Rayleigh wave excitation is much larger than would be predicted for a pure
esplosion source and scattering in a simple layered earth. In addition, the Rayleigh
waves display a radiation pattern (Toksoz and Kehrer, 1972). In the case of the
Shagan river region of the Eastern Kazakh Test site, explosions which are only
kilometers apart produce Rayleigh waves which are 180'' out of phase (North and
Fitch, 1981; Goforth, 1982). As for body waves, SH waves at teleseismic distances
are a fairly common observation (Nuttli, 1969). Similarly, in the near field, there are
Angential accelerograms which are much too large to be explained by simple
scattering (Aki et al., 1969).
A widely accepted explanation for the phenomenon of SH-type seismic wave
eneration by explosions is the release of tectonic strain. Considering the abundance
of examples for the influence of tectonic release on SH and surface waves, it is
8omewhat surprising that there is very little documentation of its influence on P

movement on the Las Vegas shear zone.
Later work by Fleck (1967; 1970) and An-
derson and others (1972) demonstrated a
late Tertiary age for the Las Vegas shear
zone. Recent work by Davis (1973) and
Longwell (1973) have returned to
lLongwell's original interpretation of the
Red Spring thrust, Only the westernmost
fault blocks containing the Red Spring
Thrust have been remapped and are shown
on Figure 3.
Davis (1973) believes that rocks below
the Keystone thrust and south of the Cot-
tonwood fault, which belong to the Contact
thrust plate of Hewett (1931), are correla-
tive with the Red Spring thrust plate. He
further interprets the Cottonwood fault as
similar to faults that cut the Red Spring
thrust, Thus he suggests that the Red Spring
thrust plate once covered most of the Juras-
sic Aztec Sandstone shown on figure 3, but
it was uplifted on a horst between the La
Madre and Cottonwood faults and was
subsequently eroded prior to the thrusting
of the Keystone thrust plate.
Longwell (1926) described discontinuous
conglomerate lenses beneath the Red Spring
thrust which he interpreted as surficial de-
posits overridden by the thrust plate. A re-
study of these conglomerates by Davis
(1973) reconfirms Longwell's interpreta-

PALEOPACIFIC oCEAN
Knowledge of the late Paleozoic assembly and
post-Paleozoic fragmentation oE Pangaea may help
define the ultimate paleogeographic origins of the
voluminous upper Paleozoic eugeosynclinal terranes
of oceanic and island-arc assemblages. Similar
suites of rock are present in broad accreted ter-
ranes northward along the Cordilleran orogen through
British Columbia and Alaska, and also across the
Pacific in Japan and adjacent parts of Eurasia
(Dickinson, 1977h). The temptation in each area of
their occurrence has been to suppose that each seg-
ment of this band of accreted eugeosynclinal mater-
ials is composed entirely of rocks formed in
marginal seas and fringing island areas or contin-
ental slivers that stood near the respective
continental margins. In each individual place,
this approach seems provincially to be the most
conservative stance and to invoke the fewest unsub-
stantiated assumptions. However, in aggregate,
this position requires that the initial distribution
of the marginal seas and fringing arcs lay in a
circumferential belt bordering but not involving the
central region of an ancestral Pacific Ocean. When
extended thus to the whole sweep of the northern
Pacific rim of the circum-Pacific orogenic belt,
there are powerful arguments that such a view is
wholly untenable. Instead, it is likely that each
segment of the orogenic belt includes eugeosynclinal
increments swept against the continental margin from
thousands of kilometers away.
Panthalassa as Paleo acific Ocean
Consider the global configuration of continents
and oceans in Permo-Triassic time about 250 mybp.
The Atlantic and Indian oceans had not yet opened
to split Pangaea. The vast Panthalassa ocean was
essentially a Paleopacific realm lying offshore
from both the Americas and Japan. On conventional
paleogeographic reconstructions such as Figure 7,
the paleo-Pacific region occupies nearly half the
surface of the earth. Reference to Figure 2 sug-
gests that several oceanic belts of indeterminate
width probably still stood open in the Asian and
Alaskan regions, but even so the Paleopacific Ocean
tmust have had an imense expanse. The various suture
belts along which the major crustal blocks of Pan-
gaea were welded together had already closed in the
Appalachian, European, Uralian, and Pan-African
regions during Paleozoic orogenies.
Note that the whole floor of the Paleopacific
Ocean was pre-Jurassic in age (the Jurassic had not
yet come at the time!). By contrast, the entire
floor of the present Pacific Ocean is known to be
Jurassic or younger from magnetic anomalies and
deep-sea drilling. This can only mean that the
entire floor of the pre-Jurassic Paleopacific
Ocean has been subducted, mainly in the circum-
Pacific region, since Triassic time. As the
pacific lithosphere descended into the mantle,
monly fill pore spaces in the reduced sandstones and conglomerates: frag-
ments of wood, lignite, or bone material that acted as centers of reduction
were replaced by rich concentrations of uranium minerals-whole pseudo-
morphed logs of uraninite and brilliantly colored uranium-vanadium oxides
were rich prizes encountered in many mines. The principal ore minerals
after pitchblende and coffinite are canary yellow carnotite
KU04)4VO,48H401 and tyuyamunite ICaU0;)VO,488H40l, bright
yellow-orange-red gummite (a mineraloid mixture of hydrous oxides of
U, Th, and Pb), and a variety of yellow, orange, blue, and black vanadium
oxides like montroseite [VO(OH)]. Minor amounts of pyrite, marcasite, ga-
lena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, bornite, chalcocite, covellite, and many other
sulfide minerals also are found. Minor amounts of native selenium are char-
acteristically associated with some uranium and uranium-vanadium ores,
and the molybdenum oxide ilsemannite (Mo4O, nH,07) is also common (Kerr,
1958).
The ore-bearing formations are nearly horizontal, but they are dis-
turbed in places by moderately strong monoclinal and anticlinal folds and
by high-angle faults. Major structural basins, such as the San Juan Basin,
the Uinta Basin, and the Piceance Basin, delimit relatively barren areas
between which there are clusters of ore deposits. A regional northwesterly
structural grain apparently reflects deep-seated igneous and tectonic move-
ments, yet there seems to be no direct relationship between the distribution
of uranium and regional structure, except insofar as tectonic history has
controlled sedimentation, geomorphology, and igneous activity, and insofar
as the ore deposits lie within the uplifted tectonically positive regions be-
tween structural basins (Kelley, 1955; Kerr, 1958). Salt domes and various
types of igneous intrusives are widely distributed in the Colorado Plateau,
and lava flows and pyroclastics are also present. Except for some Precam-
brian batholiths, the intrusives are all Miocene or younger. No general
spatial distribution between igneous activity and ore deposits can be dem-
onstrated, except where uranium mineralization is associated with dia-
tremes and volcanic collapse structures (Shoemaker, 1956).
The origin and source locales of the ore components have been the
subjects of much discussion and disagreement. Four principal ideas have
been advanced. It has been argued that (1) the ores are syngenetic and
were deposited with the sediments or as an early diagenetic cement, (2)
the uranium and vanadium were leached from overlying or interlayered
tuffs and volcanic rocks, (3) groundwaters leached the metals from the
enclosing sands or from nearby granitic sources, forming deposits where
the proper Eh-pH conditions prevailed or where groundwater circulation
was channeled, and (4) the ores are products of ascending hydrothermal
fluids derived from underlying magmas (McKelvey, Everhart, and Garrels,
1956). The syngenetic hypothesis was one of the first proposed (Coffin, 1921:
Fischer, 1950), and was widely accepted until the 1950s (Wright, 1955;
Fischer, 1956); it was based in large part upon the obvious association

island extended north-northeast across the entire
length of the Great Basin, from California to south-
ern Idaho. The cool rock in my hand contained frag-
ments of marine sediment from the Antler Moun-
tains. The great heap of stacked marine sediment
created a mountain system that pressed down on
the crust, and the edge of the continent foundered
from the weight. A deep, ocean-filled basin formed
east of the thrust front. The fragments that com-
posed my rock washed and tumbled down into this
Mississippian trough. The trough filled rapidly with
the great volumes of debris that flooded down the
flanks of the Antlcr Highlands. Deltas and turbidite
fans banked in against the submerged flanks of the
uplift in thick heaps of gravels and coarse angular
clastics, Locally this pile of debris is more than ten
thousand fcet thick.
Only the finest clastics washed to the continental
shoreline, far to the east of the Antler Mountains.
Thcse shalcs intcrbedded with limcstoncs and dol-
omites on the shallow contincntal shelf. The thin
Mississippian shelf sediments are only one-tenth as
thick as the basin sediments.
What was the environment to the west of the
Antler Mountains? We aren't certain, since there are
only a few scattered outcrops of Antler-aged rocks
found today to the west. These siliceous and vol-
canic rocks indicate deposition below the snowline
in a deep-water oceanic region, so we presume it
was deep ocean to the west. There is, however, a
thick sequcnce of late Paleozoic volcanic rocks to
the west of the Antler. These may not relate to
Antler time, but they are perhaps part of an exten-
sive younger island arc terrane. The volcanics are
now largely buried by younger rocks.
Later events werc to move the western rocks over
the former Antler highland. Their present locations
may not relate to their past sites of deposition. When
the clues are later moved around, it is difficult to de-
termine the original scene of the events,
We do know that the North American continent
was slowly drifting northward across the cquator
during the late Palcozoic. In Mississippian timme, the
cquator lay just to the south of the Great Basin,
trending from ILos Angeles to northern Wisconsin.
In Pennsylvanian time, the Great Basin was on the
cquator, as it stretched from San Francisco to Salt
Lake City, By the Permian, the equator extended
from northern California to Minnesota and the
Great Basin was just in the southern hemisphere.
gado, a few kilometers north of the fortieth parallel. Beyond Delgado, the fault
apparently arcs to the west and becomes the submarine Gorda scarp. This curve
is shown by submarine rift topography, the beheading of a submarine canyon,
and a smoothly arcuate canyon that opens at the base of the scarp [Shepard and
Emery, 1941, pp. 38-42; Shepard, 1957]. Epicenters of distinctive Franciscan-
continental-crust earthquakes, generated within 10 km of the surface, extend
along the Gorda scarp [Cameron, 1961]. This north-facing scarp is about 1.5
km high and has an average slope of about 30 [Krause et al,, 1964, Figure 3].
We infer from the onshore geology that the Gorda scarp bounds a continental
block formed of Franciscan terrane; consistent with this inference, dredge hauls
from the crest of the scarp at a depth of about 2 km and about 110 km offshore
included serpentine [Krause et al., 1964, pp. 248-249]. The San Andreas fault
thus swings westward from a coastal trend to one directly offshore and displace-
the continental margin directly seaward; the Gorda scarp is developed along the
margin of the higher standing continental plate.
The north-facing Gorda scarp is directly continuous with the south-facing
Mendocino escarpment, which begins at the foot of the continental slope (Figure
5) and continues westward for something like 2500 km. The crossover occurs
where the depth of the continental slope south of the Gorda scarp becomes
greater than the depth of the crest of the MIendocino escarpment. The MIendocino
structure apparently marks a left-lateral strike-slip fault, probably inactive,
along which a distinctive pattern of magnetic anomalies and the westward-
sloping ocean floor have been displaced about 1150 km [V'acguier et al,, 1961].
The near-shore part of the MIendocino escarpment is marked by a submarine
ridge, which stands 2 to 2.5 km above the ocean floor to the south but only
about 1 km above the floor to the north, and is formed of basalt [Krause et al.,
1964, Figure 4 and pp. 247-248].
The San Andreas fault thus turns directly seaward at the point at which
the south-facing NIendocino escarpment projects into the continent. San Andreas
and MIendocino displacements are in opposite senses; hence they cannot be part
of a single motion system. The San Andreas is highly active; the MIendocino,
apparently inactive. These anomalies, and the other features of the San Andreas-
Gorda structure, are easily accounted for if the continental plate west of the
San Andreas fault is riding over the crust of the Pacific Ocean basin. The
narrow continental slice west of the San Andreas has been drifting northwest-
ward, past interior and northern California, throughout Cenozoic time, and its
point may have been deflected westward as it encountered the south-facing
Mendocino escarpment on the ocean floor. About 100 km of displacement along
the San Andreas has postdated this encounter, the balance having occurred
before the coastal strip reached the escarpment. The inception of the Eel River
basin, which trends northwestward just north of Cape MIendocino, in the late
Miocene [Ogle, 1953] may have been due to deformation resulting from thhe
initial impinging of the San Andreas sliver against the Mendocina scarp. De-
formation of the Eel River basin has continued to the present.
Significance. The San Andreas fault system thus appears to end both to the
an inland body of water, fresh or saline, that is
too large to be called a pond. Attempting to
quantify the difference between lake and pond
is as futile as trying to define the useful but in-
exact terms mountain and hill. Swamps and
marshes are distinguished by abundant vegeta-
tion in the water: they may be as large as lakes
or as small as ponds,
According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the
lakes of North America, including the Great
Lakes contain about a quarter of all the world's
fresh surface water. This volume of water is
and weakly developed, for the ash is young and
not deeply weathered. The organic layer is thin
or lacking, At many playas the soils are alkaline
or saline.
The Payette Section and Snake River Plain are
mantled with loess 2 to 10 feet deep, and these
soils also have weakly developed profiles and are
classed as Desert Soils. In places, however, there
are Brown Soils with distinct soil horizons. On
the north side of the Snake River Plain extensive
areas are bare lava.
Water Resources
Despite being semiarid the Columbia-Snake
River Plateau has abundant water supplies, both
as surface water and as groundwater. The Co-
lumbia River enters the province with an average
annual discharge greater than the Missouri River.
Where it leaves the province and enters the Cas-
cade Range the discharge is nearly half that of
the Mississippi River at Memphis. Its principal
tributary, the Snake River, has a discharge 3 or
4 times that of the Colorado River.
A network of dams and reservoirs has been
constructed along the Columbia River (Fig. 17.30).
The largest, the Grand Coulee Dam, partly takes
the place of the Pleistocene ice dam of the
Okanogan glacial lobe. The dam is 550 feet high
and more than 4,000 feet long. The Franklin D.
Roosevelt Lake above it stores nearly 20,000,000
acre-feet of water, some of which is pumped to
a storage reservoir in Grand Coulee, where it is
distributed for irrigation in Ouincy Basin (Fig.
172).

late Mesozoic granitic. batholiths-by far the
greatest of the batholiths along the Pacific Coast
of North Amcrca, 1.000 ailes long and in places
more than 100 miiles wide. At many places the
western base of the mountains descends abruptly
to oceanic depths some thousands of feet below
sea level: the relicf. therefore, is much greater
than the mountainous heights one sees. At Van-
couver and Queen Charlotte islands and the is-
lands of southeastern Alaska are comparative
lowlands formed of Paleozoic and Mesozoic
eugeosynclinal sedimentary formations. The
many islands are separated by deep trenches,
most of them fault valleys. The summits are very
jagged with numerous matterhorns and aretes
between the ice-filled cirques, Many or most of
the glaciers extend to within 500 feet of the sea
and some reach the sea. The deep, steep-walled
valieys that extend into the mountains form
spectacular fjords. During the Pleistocene, gla-
ciers from the Coast Mountains crossed the Strait
of Georgia and extended onto Vancouver Island.
East of the Coast Mountains- are interior
mountain ranges, mostly under 8.000 feet altitude,
and mostly formed of folded Mesozoic eugeo-
synclinal formations. Associated with these
ranges are extensive plateaus capped by lavas.
The most extensive of these extends the southern
half of British Columbia covering about 15.000
square miles along each side at an altitude of
about 3,000 to 4.000 feet. It covers much of the
south half of British Columbia. The lava-capped
plateau, at an altitude of 3.000 to 4,000 feet, has
three large shield volcanoes near the middle of
the west side. The lavas are Tertiary to Holocene
in age. They overlie folded and faulted eugeo-
synclinal sedimentary formations, including
Paleozoic rocks on the east and Mesozoic on the
west. The canyon of the Frazer River is incised
into the plateau and reaches the Strait of Georgia
in a valley that curves around the south end of
the Coast Mountains (Fig. 18.29).
Uplift of the Coast Mountains began in [uras-
sic time, and during the Cretaceous Period this
was part of a mountainous area west of the geo-
synclinal sea that connected the Gulf of Mexico
and the Artic Ocean (Fig. 2.14,C: p. 378). Struc-
tural deformation and igneous activity have con-
tinued to the present time. One volcano, Mount
Alternate hypotheses assign most right-lateral
movement to much earlier times. Albers (1967) argues
that movement along the Walker Lane began in Early
Jurassic (about 150 m.y ago). He notes that Jurassic
plutons conform to the structural bends associated
with right-lateral movement but notes that the plu-
tons are not internally sheared. He also cites tight
folding in the Miocene Esmeralda Formation as evi-
dence for at least minor Miocene to Pliocene shearing
along Walker Lane. The same investigator argues for
post-early Tertiary movement along the Las Vegas
Valley Shear Zone because local Cretaceous and youn-
ger rocks are deformed along right-lateral trends.
Thus, Albers (1967) suggests that right-lateral move-
ment in southern Nevada started in the Mesozoic and
continued at least until the early or middle Tertiary.
Invoking plate tectonic theory Atwater (1970) fol-
lows Wise (1963) in suggesting that a diffused plate
boundary exists between the Great Basin and San
Andreas shear zones, Atwater (1970) assigns all move-
ment to ages younger than 30 m.y, with most as less
than f6 m.y., at least along the San Andreas system.
This suggestion is not incompatible with the conclu-
sions of Carr (1974) and Longwell (1974) based on
local evidence.
Left-Lateral Faulting
Left-lateral shearing in the NTS area is not so
easily related to regional structures, Carr (1974) sug-
gests a zone of northeast trending left-lateral shearing
occurs in the southern NTS area with displacement
broadly distributed among numerous individual fault
planes (Poole et al., 1965b; Orkild, 1968; Ekren and
Sargent, 1965; Hinrichs, 1968a). Three major fault
zones of left-lateral movement have been identified:
the Mine Mountain (not to be confused with the Mine
Mountain Thrust Fault); the Cane Springs; and the
Rock Valley fault zones (Figures 27 and 29). Another
left-lateral shear zone may transect Timber Mountain
(Carr, informal communication) (Figure 27).
Carr (1974) argues that left-lateral movement has
been slight and is a component of oblique-slip dis-
placement. The left-lateral faults offset, and in turn,
are offset by right-lateral movement along the Las
Vegas Valley Shear Zone, indicating simultaneous
development of the two strike-slip systems (Carr,
1974). Carr (1974) cites stratigraphic evidence of de-
creasing activity along the left-lateral system begin-
ning about 1l m.y, ago, with only minor offsets con-
tinuing until the present. Rogers et al. (1977) present
evidence of slight current seismic activity along these
left-lateral shear zones,
of this unit. It is overlain by fine-
grained clastic rocks of the third
unit. The two units in the upper
half of the formation are a light
gray and orange limestone and, at
the top, a darker gray thick-bedded
clayey, silty, or dolomit1zed lime-
stone that is marbleized at so me
places.
The lo wer half of the C arrara
formation is greenish-, yellowish-,
and brownish-gray shale with l or
2 bands of dark-gray limes,one,
which form ledges in the steep shaly
slope. The upper half of the for-
mation forms a striking series of
broken cliffs, visible from a distance
as a broad band of alternating
white, orange, pink, and brown
limestone overlain by dark-graY
limestone.
The upper contact is not easily
discernible and the Carrara forma-
tion appears to be transitional into
the overlying Bonanza King forma-
tion through a zone of irregularly
dolomitized limestone with dolomi-
tization increasing upw ards into
the overlying formation.
A trilobite, identified only as an
olenellid type, collected from a bed
beneath the algal (Girvanella)
limestone in the lower part of the
for mation indicates a late Early
Cambrian age. The age of the
Carrara formation is Early and
Middle Cambrian and it correlates
roughly both in lithology and in
overall thickness with units of the
same age overlying the StirlingC)and

Alternating light- and dark-gray
dolomite layers, forming a sequence
3,800feet thick, are correlated on the
basis of stratigraphic position and
lithology with the Bonanza King
formation of the type locality in
the Providence Mountains, Calif.
(Hazzard and Mason, 1936, p. 234-
238), and with the Bonanza King
formation in the Nopah Range.
Calif., as revised by Palmer and
Hazzard (1956, p. 2494-2499). The
formation is mostly thin- to thick-
bedded dolomite with a few zones
as much as 150 feet thick that
contain intercalated silty and sandy
layers and partings, and locally thin
cherty zones.
A co mplete section measured
north of the mouth of Tungsten
Canyon contains roughly a dozen
units that differ from one another

and secondary dolomite and in the
Pseudoagnostus, a distinct U pper
Cambrian agnostid, as well as other
poorly preserved agnostid and
aphelaspid trilobite forms, have
been identified from the lower shale
member of the Nopah formation at
Bare Mountain. These indicate the
equivalence of the member with the
basal Nopah formation at its type
locality in the Nopah Range, Cali-
fornia, and with the basal shaly
part of the Cornfield Springs for-
mation of Hazzard and Mason,
1937, in the Providence Mountains.
California (P almer and Hazzard,
1956). The lower shale member of
the Nopah formation together with
several hundred feet of limestone
and dolomite above and below the
shale also correlate closely litho-
logically with the Dunderberg shale
and carbonate units ad)acent to it
in the A EC Nevada Proving Grounds
(Johnson and Hibbard, 1957, p. 340-

MacKevett, 1958, p. 6). Units within
the group were not differentiated

In 1947, Murata found that the quantity of silica determinable by
standard colorimetric methods in aged-water samples from Steamboat
Springs, Nevada, was much less than the total silica content determined
gravimetrically (White, Brannock, and Murata, 1956). In contrast, it
was later found by Murata and White that the values for colorimetrically
determinable silica in fresh samples were approximately equal to those
for total silica determined gravimetrically. A series of detailed observa-
tions and measurements on the state of silica in hot spring waters were
then carried out in the field by Brannock and White (White, Brannock,
and Murata, 1956). In 1961, Morey and others reported upon the colori-
metrically determinable silica in water from several hot springs and
geysers in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. This work was con-
tinued in 1962 and 1963. Many of the results are shown in figure 2,
where the silica contents of various actively discharging hot springs
and geysers are plotted versus the temperature of the water in the pools,?
The circles indicate colorimetrically determinedr silica measured at
poolside immediately after collection. The triangles show the total dis-
solved silica content of each water sample. A curve showing the solubility
Progressing from the fresh waters to thermal waters, a marked
ecrease occurs in the proportion of the divalent cations,
especially calcium, relative to the monovalent cations sodium
gnd potassium.
Ratios of elements which may be useful in determining flow
irection and extents of solution-rock interaction have varyin
atterns of distribution (Table 2). The high ratios of Cl/Ca
gnd Cl/Mg in thermal waters from along Hot C reek are prob-
ably due to the loss of carbon dioxide and the precipitation of
calcium carbonate at depth. The (Ca''')/Na ratios for these
springs are less than 1 for the same reason. Springs with higher
yratios of Cl/Ca and Cl/Mg generally have lower Ca/Mg ra-
tios, perhaps indicating precipitation of magnesian calcite.
g]/(HCO, + CO,) ratios decrease as spring temperature de-
creases. Truesdell [1975] attributed a similar change in Sho-
ghone Geyser Basin, Yellowstone Park, Wyoming, to the reac-
tion
That is, as hot water cools in contact with alkali alumino-
silicate (or silicate) minerals at constant activity of the
alkali ions, the pH increases [Hemley, 1959] and more dis-
golved carbon dioxide is converted to bicarbonate with simul-
taneous introduction of alkali ions. If this reaction is con-
trolling the ClHCO, + CO,) ratio, then the Cl/Na rato should
change in a similar manner, and the ratio of Na/(C1
HCO, + CO,) should remain approximately constant. The
Cl/Na ratios generally follow the Cl/(HCO, + CO,) ratios,
alhough the Na/(Cl + CO, + HCO,) ratios range from 0.81
to 1.05. Thermal springs along Hot Creek and Little Hot
Creek have constant ratios of Na/(C1 + CO, + HCO,),
0.98-1.01, indicating that solution of sodium feldspar and
precipitation of clay may be controlling the ratio in this area.
However, lower ratios of Na/(C1 + CO, + HCO,) and higher
Cl/K ratios in the area between Hot Creek and Lake Crowley
may indicate solution of something other than sodium feldspar
or the precipitation of some sodium-potassium phases.
Low ratios of Na/K for thermal springs along Hot Creek
may indicate that they are associated with a higher-tem-
perature part of the thermal reservoir. Oruille [1963] and
Wkite [1965] have shown that low N a/K ratios indicate high
temperatures of equilibrium. The (Ca''')/Na ratios range from
0.28 for the steam well at Casa Diablo to 2.0 for the hot spring
on Little Hot Creek. Ratios of Cl/Rb, Na/Rb, and Na/lLi
generally increase in hydrothermal areas as the fluids react
with the country rock, producing hydrothermal minerals
[Ells, 1970]. In Long Valley, Cl/Rb, Na/Rb, and Na/lLi
ratios are smallest for hot springs along Hot Creek, increasing
as spring temperatures decrease toward Lake Crowley. Per-
haps thermal spring waters issuing in the area between Hot
Creek and Lake Crowley have relatively less rubidium and
lithium because of more extensive reaction with the country
rock. The slight increase in Cl/Li and Cl/F as the spring
temperatures decrease may indicate loss of these minor ele-
ments into alteration minerals. Low N H,/Na ratios are found
in the springs which are releasing gas. Ratios of C1/SO, are
nearly constant, increasing slightly from northwest to south-
east with the highest ratios in thermal springs south of the
alkali lakes.
Thermal springs in Long Valley have Cl/B ratios in the
range 6.6-5.6. C1/B ratios for springs in and near Hot Creek
Gorge may be highest (6.4-6.6) because of phase separation
with loss of boron into the vapor phase. Such phase separation
is not uncommon in hot-water systems; this vapor phase con-
ABSTRACT
Evaluation of volume and temperature data
available in June 1978 indicates that 1650 t 140
x 104 1 are present in reservoirs of 215 iden-
tified hydrothermal convection systems 290C in
the United States to a depth of 3 km (excluding
energy in National Parks). Thermal energy re-
coverable at the surface from these reservoirs
is estimated to be 400 $ 60 104 1. Electri-
cal energy producible from identified high-
temperature (>150C) systems is estimated to be
23,000 3400 megawatts for 30 years, and bene-
ficial heat producible from identified interme-
diate-temperature (90%-1150%C) systems is esti-
mated to be 42 13 x 101 1. Undiscovered
thermal energy is evaluated by geologic prov-
inces ; the total undiscovered component is esti-
mated to be 8000 I0M 1, of which 2000 x
)04 1 might be recoverable. The total identi-
fied and undiscovered thermal energy in reser-
voirs of hydrothermal convection systems to a
depth of 3 km (excluding energy in National
Parks) is estimated to be 9600 s 104 7. Total
recoverable energy of 2400 s 101 1 could con-
tribute 95,000-150,000 megawatts of electricity
for 30 years and 230-350 s 10 1 of beneficial
heat, with the higher number for electricity
going with the lower number for beneficial heat,
and conversely.
INTRODUCTION
This report deals with hydrothermal convec-
tion systems in the United States with mean re-
servoir temperatures greater than or equal to
90C and depths less than 3 km. Our goal is to
determine (1) the accessible resource base,
(2) the 35SEES5. and (3) the amount of Eg-
EE2S3$Y or beneficial heat that might be pro-
duced from these systems. We divide the thermal
energy in hydrothermal convection systems into
that which is identified and that which is g-
discovered. The identified systems are listed
in tables 4, 5, and 6, along with estimates of
their reservoir properties, thermal energy con-
tent, recoverable energy, and electricity or
beneficial heat production. Undiscovered ther-
mal energy is estimated by geomorphic province
and is listed in table 8.
The accessible resource base is the stored
thermal energy for individual hydrothermal con-
vection systems and for the sum of all the sys-
tems. The accessible resource base for an in-
dividual system is defined for this assessment
as the amount of geothermal energy within a spe-
cified volume of rock and at a specified temper-
ature referenced to 15C. The accessible re-
source base corresponds to the 'resource base'
of White and Williams (1975) and Renner, White,
and Williams (1975) in the Assessment of Geo-
thermal Resources of the United States--1975
(U.S. Geological Survey Circular 726). It dif-
fers slightly from the 'accessible resource
base'' defined by Muffler and Cataldi (1978) in
that we refer to energy in the Earth between two
specified depths, rather than from the surface
to a specified depth. The depth limit of eco-
nomic production drilling for geothermal re-
sources varies with drilling costs and economics
and currently is about 3 km. As in the 1975 as-
sessment, we therefore do not consider any sys-
tem or part of a system deeper than 3 km.
The recoverable energy is that fraction of
the accessible resource base that can be pro-
duced at the wellhead under reasonable assump-
tions of future technology and economics and is
defined as the E9EES5 (Muffler and cataldi,
1978).
Essential components of a hydrothermal con-
vection system are a heat source, a fluid (usu-
ally water but in a few rare instances steam),
and adequate vertical permeability to allow the
hot, low-density fluids to rise and, in most
systems, be replaced by cooler fluids. Most of
the thermal energy in the Earth is stored in
rocks. Convective circulation of hot fluids is
the primary mechanism whereby the energy is
transported to reservoirs near enough to the
Earth's surface so that it can be economically
extracted.
Geologic settings of hydrothermal convection
systems in the United States are diverse. They
are most likely to develop in areas where there
is residual heat related to relatively young
volcanic activity and in areas where regional
heat flow is high. Fault zones appear to be the
most common conduits for movement of fluids in
convecting systems; locations of many systems
seem to be controlled by intersecting struc-
tures. Reservoirs from which the hot fluids are
produced can be either porous or fractured rock;
fracture reservoirs are more important in high-
temperature systems.
Hydrothermal convection systems can be clas-
sified into two main types--vapor-dominated and
hot-water, depending on whether steam or liquid
water, respectively, is the continuous, pres-
sure-controlling phase in the reservoir. The
characteristics of each type of system have been
described by White, Muffler, and Truesdell
(1971), Truesdell and White (1973), and White
(1970, 1973).

areas, where small channels conducted the flow to s
pool, the flow for each channel was estimated and the
several flows were totaled. Small flows are difficult to
estimate, but by making measurements of width.
depth, and velocity, and checking these against
volumetric measurements when feasible, it is believed
reasonably accurate results were obtained.

Seven float measurements of discharge of Salt Creek
were made about half a mile below McLean Falls in the
canyon, just before it emerges from the Salt Creek
Hills. The stream channel here flows on bedrock of
fine-grained sandstone, and there is little opportunity
for underflow. The channel is from 4 to 6 feet wide,
but maximum depths are usually not more than 3 or
4 inches. All the measurements were made at the same
location by T. W, Robinson. Depths were measured
with a steel tape and velocity by timing floats with a
stopwatch. The measurements are believed to be
sufficiently accurate to show true variations in flow,
and these are attributed to evapotranspiration losses.
channels usually continue from the mud flats into the
permanent salt crust where the water eventually
disappesrs.
The discharge of the spring area was estimated by
noting the number of channels and estimating their
flow. To this figure was added the loss by evaporation
from the seep areas of mud and salt. The combined
flow in some 30 channels was estimated at 150 gpm.
The loss from 250 acres of salt and mud flat was esti-
mated as 78 gpm, making the total spring discharge
225 gpm.

This marsh is a much smaller spring area than the
one just described. However, water was discharged
in much the same manner. The flow from 10 small
seep areas was estimated as 10 gpm, and loss from about
80 acres of mud and salt flat, partly overgrown with
salt grsss, s sbout 20 gpm. Total discharge is 30 gpm

This marsh is similar to, but smaller than, the sod

rather widely spaced seep areas. The discharge fron
them was estimated at about 15 gpm. In addition
the loss in some 10-15 acres of wetted mud and sal
flat was estimated as about 5 gpm. Total discharg
for the area on this basis is about 20 gpm.
The area next south of the marsh on the north sid
of the Harmony Borax Hills, where there is discharg
of water from springs onto the saltpan, is the alluviE
fan of Furnace Creek Wash. However, the source c
this water is largely from Travertine Springs in F urnac

distance of about 17 miles, there is no measurabl
discharge of water onto the saltpan. From Badwate
south to the end of the saltpan there are several spring
and marshes.

According to Gudde (1949), the name Badwater orig
nated in a notation on the Furnace Creek Atlas shee
published in 1908, that the water was not drinkabl
that is, ''bad water.'' The springs at Badwater are .
the lowest altitude-280 feet below sea level-of ar
in the United States. The lowest land-surface altitu
282 feet below sea level, occurs in the saltpan at 2 poin
4 miles west and 3 miles northwest of the spring
The most prominent feature of Badwater is the lar
pool into which the springs discharge (fig. 11). The
are two pools at Badwater, the second and smaller o
is about one-tenth of a mile north of the large pool s1
not so prominent. The total water-surface area of the
two pools in January and April 1959 was about b.
3 mm thick and about 30 mm long; an occssional one
may be 40 mm long and only 1 mm thick. They are
holllow tubes, and many contain a drop or so of water.
Most of them lesn or are bent in the direction of the last
strong wind.
Another festure of the flood plains is the salt pools
which develop where the water table is shallow enough
to dissolve through the salt crust, giving rise to struc-
tures collapsed into the underlying pool for the most
part of sslt-ssturated water (fig. 37). They are most
abundant and best developed 5% miles northwest of
Badwater, around the north end of the massive rock sslt.
coaPOsITION OF TEE EBIMEs
In general, the content of salts in the brines in Desth
Valley increases panward, is grester in ground water
than in surface water, greater in dry years than in wet
years, and grester in standing water than in running
water. The increase in sslts psnward is due both to
evaporation of water and to re-solution of salts. Semi-
quantitative chemical analyses of the brines are given
in tables 50-52.
The effect of the several variables on the composition
of the brines is illustrsted by a series of grapbs (figs.
38-50) representing suites of samples along ground-
water and surface-drainage courses into the pan.
Differences in major constituents along s 5-mile
stretch of Salt Creek where it enters the pan are illus-
trated on figure 38. This grsph illustrates the incresse
in total salts panward and the increase in sodium and
potassium relative to calcium and magnesium. Car-
bonates were not determined in these brine samples, but
other analyses (table 34) indicate that along one stretch
of Salt Creek there is about a fifth as much bicarbonate
A series of samples along s 3,000-foot traverse into
the northesst corner of Cottonball Basin, in the Salt
Springs ares, is illustrated on figure 39. This graph
illustrates the panward incresse in salts, but it also
shows that the ground water is more saline than surface
water at the same position in the pan. Later tests in
this same sres indicate that the uppermost layer of
the ground water is more saline than deeper layers.
In February 1958, a few days after s rain, the uppermost
ground water, 3-4 inches below the surface, contsined
4.3 percent dissolved solids, wheress ground water
bailed from 3X feet contained only 2.5 percent.
Springs used as a source of domestic water supplies
in the Furnace Creek ares are located along faults on
the fans north of Furnace Creek Wash. Four major
sources are Travertine and Nevares Springs, and
springs in the bluffs near Cow Creek. Analyses of the
waters sre given in table 35, page B73.
The springs at Cow Creek probably are fed by
ground water underflow from the Nevares Springs;
the other springs are warm springs, and probably the
high temperatures are due to circulation at no grest
depth but through warm rocks. The thermal gradient
in the ground in this highly faulted area probably is
higher than average, and an increase of only 30 F
over the annual average temperature would beat the
water to the maximum observed (104 F). This could
be aceomplished with circulation no deeper than about
1,500 feet (see p. B40).
The water is believed to be moving into Desth
Valley along faults itn the Furnace Creek fault zone
and derived ultimately from the Pahrump Valley
(p. B38; see also Hunt and Robinson, 1960). This
water is very different from that on the west side of
Cottonball Basin, which probably moves in along faults
from Mesquite Flat (p. B37; see also Hunt and
Robinson, 1960).
The total dissolved solids in these spring waters is
low compared to other Death Valley water; but by the

set has two cases for the composition of unit CHn that correspond to the
extremes that may be found at Yucca Mountain; either it is vitric with a
relatively high conductivity (the unit is then referred to as CHnv), or
it is zeolitized with a relatively low conductivity (the unit is then
referred to as CHnz). The relative elevations of each of the units used
in the one- dimensional calculations (Figure 7) are based on the
stratigraphy of drill hole USW G-4, which is located on the eastern
boundary of the prospective repository location (Figures l and 2). Unit
TSw3 is combined with TSw2 in this column because it is relatively thin
(--15 m) and has rock mass hydrologic properties similar to those of
TSw2. The combined unit is referred to as ''TSw2-3''. These calculations
assume that the unit properties are constant throughout each unit.
The percolation rate values listed in Table 2 span the range
su5E5ested for the Yucca Mountain site under current conditions and under
currently postulated future scenarios (DOE, 1984). As shown below, these
values also span the range over which water movement occurs only in the
matrix and in both the matrix and the fractures. The cases having a
percolation rate of 0.1 mm/ yr have water movement only in the matrix
nearly everywhere in the column. The 0.5-mm/ yr problems have a
relatively small amount of water movement in the fractures in some
units. The 4.0-mm/ yr problems have considerable water movement in
fractures in some units (e .E., units TCw and TSw2- 3).

the tin production now comes from placer deposits.
The ''stream tin,'' which is derived from the weath-
ering of stockworks and lodes in granite and other
rocks, has accumulated in alluvial and eluvial de-
posits in a manner similar to gold.
The stream tin is in the form of rounded pellets
of shot, bean, or nut size. Associated minerals are
similar pellets of limonite, hematite, magnetite, gar-
net, wolframite, tourmaline, and other placer min-
erals.
The greatest tin placer deposits are those of Ma-
laysia (Table 13-2), where extensive alluvial depos-
its containing only half a pound of tinstone to the
cubic yard are worked by some of the largest
dredges in the world.
The Indonesian tin deposits resulted from deep
trpoical weathering of granite containing lean stock-
works and sparse veinlets of quartz and cassiterite
giving rise to eluvial concentrations of cassiterite
(koelits) and of alluvial concentrations (kaksas) dur-
ing Quaternary time. An eluvial origin is indicated
by unworn cassiterite, in high concentration, along
with angular fragments of other resistant Indone-
sian.g1Inerals. These deposits contribute a consid-
erable part of the tin production (Table 13-2). They
are really a transient stage in the formation of the
alluvial tin placers because eventually the eluvial
material reaches the stream channels and there
undergoes rigorous stream concentration to form
the productive stream placers. During a slight sub-
sidence of the region in Quaternary time, when the
islands became separated from each other, the pay
streaks of tinstone became covered by subsequent
gravels and sands and the downstream parts be-
came submerged beneath the sea, so that former
stream gravels are now dredged from the sea bot-
tom.
Small amounts of stream tin are also found in
Nigeria, China, Zaire, Bolivia, Thailand, Burma,
Victoria, New South Wales, and Tasmania. A triv-
ial amount was obtained as a by-product from gold
gravels in Alaska. About two-thirds of the world
supply of tin is obtained from placer deposits.
See Chapter 21 for the history, production, uses,
and deposits of tin.

feldspar-biotite-hornblende gneiss. It is suggested
that the deposits have a syn- or pre-tectonic intru-
sive origin. Post ore folding has resulted in a vari-
able thickness of the ore. Widths range from about
40 meters to less than 1 meter (Fig. 19-31).
According to Valentine, the Pikwe ore body
forms an arcuate shape at the surface and has a
strike length of 3300 meters, which reduces below
to 400 meters. The deepest point of intersection of
the ore zone is 370 meters. The deposit can be
divided roughly into three zones: a southern mas-
sive plus 70 percent sulfide zone with grades up to
2.5 percent Ni and 1.5 percent Cu, enclosed in grey
gneisses; a central semimassive 40 to 70 percent
sulfide zone underlaid with poorly mineralized host
amphibolite; and a northern low-grade 0.8 percent
nickel and 0.8 percent copper zone of generally
disseminated ore with localized bands of massive
sulfide distributed throughout the host amphibolite.
and quartzitic rocks. The ore bodies follow the gen-
eral trend of the country rocks and the dips vary
from 90 degrees to 35 degrees south. There are
structural similarities of these bodies to the dilatant
ore deposits of the Homestake deposits in South
Dakota.
The most important and abundant ore mineral is
sphalerite accompanied by some chalcopyrite and
galena. The largest zinc ore bodies are located at
the northern edge of the complex near the footwall
contact of quartzitic and dolomite-skarn rocks. The
structure of the deposits is complicatred due to
metamorphism, faulting, folding, and replacement
changes.
The Ristonaho-Valisaari zinc ore body at Vihanti
is about 400 meters in length and 10-40 meters in
width. The composition of the zinc ore bodies is 7-
14 percent zinc, 0.5-0.8 percent copper, and 0.4-
0.7 percent lead with small amounts of silver and
gold.
The pyritic ores that are mined in the Outokumpu
deposits consist of pyrite, of course, but with vary-
ing amounts of pyrrhotite. Sphalerite and chalco-
pyrite are. present only-in small quantities. Because
of the complex nature of the ore mineralogy of
these deposits, Finland is noted for her develop-
ment of large, efficient, automated smelters and
refineries. Their plants are sold, and constructed in
many different nations including Russia.
Outokumpu Oy is a government-led company
whose capital stock amounts to 96 million Fmk.
The biggest shareholder is the Finnish state with 51
percent of the shares. Kansanelokelaitos (Old Age
Pensions Scheme) has about 49 percent, and 0.001
percent of the shares are owned by five other share-
holders.
Each of the mines has its own distinctly unique

Other Provinces. South America contains important
local lead-zinc deposits in Peru, Bolivia, and Ar-
gentina. Europe is fairly bountifully supplied with
lead and zinc. There is a Mediterranean province
with deposits in Spain, Roumania, Turkey, and
Tunisia; a central European province includes parts
of Czechoslovakia, Germany, Poland, and England.

FIGURE B1. Antimony deposits in northern Nye County (Lawrence, 1963, pl, 1),
tered localities in the low hills extending northwest along
the boundary of Esmeralda and Nye Counties.
The visible secondary copper minerals are mainly asso-
ciated with quartz veins at the Florence Mine, San
Antone district and at the Lodi, Reveille, Troy and Twin
River districts, Copper minerals are associated locally with
skarn in contact-metasomatized zones at the Fairplay,
Lodi, and Tonopah (Rays area) districts and with mafic
plugs and dikes at the Lodi district. The minerals occur in
a shear zone in altered andesite at Ellendale district. An
unusual copper deposit west of Duckwater near Brown
Summit, Pancake Range mining area, consists of anas-
tomosing veinlets, fracture fillings, and coatings of sec-
ondary minerals (chalcocite, cuprite, malachite, and a
little azurite) that cut and stain fractured Permian Ely
lLimestone and Rib Hill Sandstone and sandy con-
glomerate (Newark Canyon Formation, pl, A1). Quartz
veins are absent and alteration is weak, Several properties
there have been explored by strippings and shallow cuts,
Modern exploration cuts near a very old shallow shaft of
unknown age with log cribbing appear not to have reach-
ed the Paleozoic strata that underlie most of the sur-
rounding area. Copper-stained conglomerate (Newark
Canyon Formation, pl. A1) is esposed there near the axis
of an overturned syncline that involves the range for a
length of at least 9 miles (14.5 km). These and other cop-
per prospects extend for about 1 miles (2.4 km) along a
narrow, north-trending zone generally just east of and
within several hundred yards of a major north-trending
normal fault. The fault drops Permian Rib Hill Sand-

Newark Canyon Formation down on the east against Ely
Rattlesnake Canyon, Tybo district, Hot Creek Range,
has yielded a banded rhyolite (tuff?) suitable for
building and flagstone material (Kral, 1951, p. 194). A
small amount of stone was taken from the Miocene and
(or) Pliocene Horse Camp Foundation of Moores (1964)
southeast of Currant, Nevada, but its disposition is
unknown, A Tertiary siliceous, tuffaceous siltstone and
shaly siltstone unit, ethibiting liesegang bands on
bedding surfaces, was quarried about 9 miles (14.4 km)
southwest of the Ellendale district for use in store fronts
(Painted Chief claim, Kral, 1951, p. 57). The strata are
thin-bedded, and the best material splits into slabs as
much as several inches thick. The beds are considerably
fractured, however, and most slabs seen were less than a
few feet across, When examined in July 1966, the
southernmost of two properties there was posted as the
Rainbow Placer claims. During barite mining just west
of Warm Springs, southern Hot Creek Range, Devo-
nian argillite and siltstone yielded minor amounts of
banded, iron-stained ornamental stone. The major use
of the stone was not detemined, but a very little was
made into carvings and sold in the store at Warm
Springs,
A travertine deposit (RP-3, pl, B1) in limestone of the
Triassic Luning Formation was being quarried in
September 1965 in the Republic camp, Royston Hills
area, As Kral (1951, p. 44-46) made no mention of the
deposit, it is believed to have opened after the date of
his report. The travertine forms a series of pure-white
mammillary crustifications on the east wall of an
andesite(?) dike. The travertine deposit dips steeply
west, as does the Luning Formation, and it feathers into
limestone on the south. Its maximum outcrop dimen-
sions are 150 x 400 feet (46 x 122 m); the center part is
more pure and massive than its edges, which show
crustification and a greater tendency to split into mam-
millary fragments, The quarried material was cut and
polished into table tops and similar products, The
largest quarried block was nearly equidimensional and
measured 4 feet (1.2 m) on each side,
Fluorite
The largest known deposits in northern Nye County
lie in two fluoritized areas, neither of which has yielded
more than several hundred tons of ore but both of
which may have large potential resources. These two
widely separated areas, one in the Willow Creek district
and the other in the Union district, are the only places
where fluorite has been mined in northern Nye County
up to 1980. Hearsay reports indicate that the Hi Grade
claims in Willow Creek district, Quinn Canyon Range,
may have been mined most recently (1970's) and may
have yielded several thousand tons of ore, We wish to
emphasize that the Willow Creek district has the poten-
tial to become a major fluorspar mining area of the
United States, The numerous deposits in the Shoshone
Range, especially in the Union district, imply that this
area also may have considerable future potential, Little
specific data is available for the Shoshone deposits,
however, and which localities will be explored or what
directions future development will take cannot be
ascertained.
The observed fluorite in northern Nye County is
generally colorless, but locally it is not uncommon to
find white and purplish material; green fluorite was seen
at the Nyco Mine, Willow Creek district. The fluorite
commonly may be so finely crystalline as to have a
sugary texture, especially in some deposits in carbonate
rocks of the Willow Creek district, or it may be coarsely
crystalline, as in veins in volcanic rocks there and in
veins at property near Berlin, Union district.
Claims in the Union district, Shoshone Range, are
under diverse ownership and have been developed and
explored by trenching and minor underground workings
(Kral, 1951, p. 203; Horton, 1961, p. 16-17). The
fluorite deposits in the Willow Creek district have been
developed similarly to those in the Union district and
are also under diverse ownership. Fluorite has also been
reported or observed, but not mined, in the Paradise
Range. The noteworthy large Kaiser (Baxter) fluorspar
mine described by Ross (1961, p. 77, 80, table 6.1) lies
near the Paradise Range on the north flank of the
Monte Cristo Mountains just outside the county,
The most common type of alteration associated with
the fluorite deposits, particularly those in the Willow
Creek district, is silicification, which affects both pre-
Tertiary strata and Tertiary volcanic rocks. Massive
silicified zones are particularly conspicuous where Ter-
tiary welded tuff is the host rock. Bleached and argil-
lized welded tuff is also common locally.
Fluorite and sulfide deposits are spatially related in
the Shoshone Range, and pyrite is disseminated in the
wallrock of the fluorite veins at the Nyco Mine, Willow
Creek district. Other fluorite deposits in the Willow
Creek district are mostly devoid of other ore minerals;
gangue is commonly silica and silicified, brecciated host
rock. Besides occurring as veins and crystals lining
fracture surfaces and vugs in the Willow Creek, Union,
and Cloverdale districts, the fluorite in other deposits of
the Willow Creek district fills irregularly shaped
fracture zones. Also, fluorite forms replacement bodies
in carbonate strata and silicified carbonate rocks in
the Willow Creek district and in the Union district
(Silberling, 1959, p. 12). Some of the bodies in the
Willow Creek district are spatially and probably
genetically related to a northeast-trending acid porphyry
dike swarm that cuts the carbonate strata (Sainsbury
and Kleinhampl, 1969, pl. 1).
All the fluorspar deposits in the Willow Creek district
are presumably Tertiary and related to volcanism, but
ages are not everywhere well documented, The deposits
occur in either Tertiary volcanic rocks or Paleozoic car-
bonate strata; none has been noted in association with
granitic plutons. Fluorspar of the Union district com-
monly lies adjacent to steep faults in a host rock of
limestone of the Triassic Grantsville Formaion, Also,
fluoritized and silicified lenses occur in the Luning For-
mation along the Shoshone thrust and subsidiary shears
(Silberling, 1959, p. 12, 18). The deposits were tentative-
ly considered mesothermal, presurmably pre-Tertiary.
and they were excluded from a general north-trending
western epithermal fluorspar belt containing most of the
other fluorspar deposits of Nevada (Horton, 1964a,
p. 199-202).
mations of this rock have been recognized and mapped
by Messrs. Emmons and Garrey. These fortmations are
not necessarily individual flows. Some of them are really
parts of a single thick flow, and others are certainly com-
posed of several fluws. Intercalated between the rhyo-
lites are five fluws of plagioclase basalt, one flow of
quartz latite, some stratified tuffs, and finally capping the
series, a flow of quartz-bearing basalt. The effusive
rocks are cut by intrusions of rhyolitic porphyry, plagio-
clase basalt, and leucite basanite. Most of the basalt
dikes occupy fault fissures.
The Tertiry lavas and tuffs are generally conformable
to one another, but at a few places slight erosional un-
conformity has bbeen detected.
The entire series of voleanic rocks iss divided by faults
into a large number of blucks in each of which the flows
are in general tilted to the east at angles up to 40''. The
fault planes strike from northwest to northeast and dip
generally to the west. The displacement as a general
rule, is normal; that is, the hanging wall in each case
has slipped down relative tu the foot wall. In conse-
quence of this structure anyone traveling across the dis-
trict from west to east will see the edges pf the same
flows repeated again and again in the successive western
fronts of the ridges.
regard to the veins they say:
Most of the lodes are not simple veins, but are fissure
zones (of nearly vertical dip) containing numerous vein-
lets or stringers of vein material and in most cases show-
ing no definite walls. The principal stringers are parallel
with the sides of the loddde as a whole, but they are linked
by numerous irregular cross veinlets, and similar small
stringers extend for varying distances into the country
rock. The lodes range in wilth from a few inches to 10
or even 100 feet.
Typical vein quartz, such as is characteristic of the
gold veins of the Appalachians or Sierra Nevada or such
as is ffound in the pre-Tertiary schists of the IBullfrog
district, does not occur in the mines near Rhyolite, with
the exception of the Original Bullfrog. The quarts is
prevailingly fine grained, often of a porcelain-like tex-
ture, and is usually intercrystallized with calcite.
longest, is in about 200 feet. Place states that most of the work
has been done on a vein of white quartz, 1-3 feet wide, which
contains free gold and arsenopyrite. He states that this vein can
be traced for 4,300 feet. The present owner became interested
in the ground in 1932 and installed a small mill with which he
milled 50 tons of the better dump rock. He states that he recov-
ered about $450 and decided to stop his activity until he could
become associated with someone having a better knowledge of
mining operations.
A property cummonly known as the Melbourn group, lies about
1 mile above the Colurado group on the northwest side of Wjllow
Creek. As previously mentioned, this property was discovered
in 1913 and the high-grade found caused considerable excitement.
'Tho ground was later sold to IEly interests and was known as the
tiuoddman pruperty. Hlill states that the vein strikes N. 67- W,
and dips 40-70' S. It is 10- 18 inches wide and consists of
crushed white quartz with a green talc along the seams. The
values are largely in native gold which usually occurs in the talc.
The vein is in altered lime shale associated with an andesite dike.
It is reported that the ground was once leased by Cassidy and
Cater who produced about $25,000. The property is reportedly
opened by several adits, the lower of which is known as the Good-
man tunnel.
About 4 miles air line south of the W illow Creek properties is
a group of fluorite claims known as the Spar, reportedly owned
by A. F. W. Carlson and C. W. Jones of IBishop, California. The
claims are estimated to be at an elevation of 8,000 feet. They
are reached from the Adaven post office by traveling generally
southwest 12 miles to the Pine (Creek raneh, th-n 6 miles up Pine
Creek. Although a ''Jeep'' road of sorts has been bnnilt to within
a few hundred feet of the princip)al wurkings, it is necessary to
walk about one-half mile up this road. The best fluorite was seen
at the lower workings where a short adit and winze have been
dug on a 5-foot width of high-grade spar occurring in a limestone
eliff, Several short adits and cuts expose the same or a parallel
shear zone bearing westerly up a steepm slope. It appears that this
zone is along the south contact of a large rhyolite dike with the
limestone. Paulting along this area has caused a slight ravine to
the ridge which is about 800 feet west of the lower adit. The
owners' sample returns show values ranging frrom T5 to iH98.6
percent: CaF,. Several exposures were seen where high-grade
fluorite could be sorted from the softer waste rork.
A property of unknuwn ownership, known as the Dresser Mine,
Properties. Old workings, possibly abandoned, include a 150-
foot inclined shaft and an old adit about 100-feet in length. 'The
shaft was sunk on the dip of a 4-foot quartz vein in rhyolite. It
appears that the work may have been started on near-surface
enrichment of oxidized silver minerals. These enriched surface
ores, were usually an incentive for deeper work. A cabin on the
ground is in rehabilitable condition and indicates that the last
work here may have been done in the thirties.
The Pittsburg group, owned by E. J. Reed and Ed Slavin of
Tonopah, is said to lie about 4 miles east of the Tolicha road and
the old workings of the Wilaons district. A mineralized zone lies
in and adjacent to several parallel quartz veins striking north-
east. The values are in silver and gold.
The workings include a 300-foot inclined shaft with 40 feet of
laterals on the 100-foot level, 1T5 feet on the 200, and 850 feet on
the 300- or bottom level. Samples noted, indicate low silver values
and some gold in the workings off the shaft. A 425-foot adit is
said to show little indication of ore.
the conglomerate progressively bevels the Aztec Sandstone, the Chinle For-
mation, and the Moenkopi Formation. Thick wedges of coarse conglom-
erate higher in the formation show by northward thinning and decreasing
coarseness that an important source was in an area to the south where vol-
canic rocks and related intrusive bodies now form the chief outcrops.
Above the basal conglomerate the Thumb Formation consists of reddish
andstone and siltstone, conglomerate, fresh-water limestone, gypsum, and
thin-bedded flagstone, with a total thickness of 2,ooo to ;oo feet. Basalt
flows and tuffaceous beds are included locally. Numerous large lenses of
breccia, made up of Precambrian gneiss, schist, and granite, are seen at many
horizons of the section; these lenses are as much as ;0o feet thick, and some
are more than half a mile long. Probably they represent landsliding from
growing scarps south and east of the basin of deposition (Longwell, 1g5r,
p. 352), Toward the northeast, outcrops of the formation are interrupted
by a cover of younger deposits,
Nothing analogous to the Overton Fanglomerate occurs in association
with the Thumb Formation.
Cretaceous(i) or Tertiary(?) System
Overton Fanglomerate. The Overton Fanglomerate as originally de-
Snned (Longwell, 9a, p. s2) included he Willow Tank and Baseline For-
mations, Later (Longwell, 1949. P. 931), these formations were given sepa-
rate status and the name Overton Fanglomerate was restricted to the thick
section of coarse deposits resting unconformably on the Baseline Sandstone
and older formations, The redefined Overton, made up largely of carbon-
ate fragments derived from Paleozoic formations, has crude bedding in
which large blocks, many of them tens of feet long, have disordered arrange-
ment, It is steeply tilted to the east and has been bevelled by erosion through
its entire thickness, which at a maximum exceeds 2ooo feet. Apparently this
coarse debris accumulated as coalescent fans in front of an advancing thrust
sheet, which moved eastward across a strongly folded belt.
Southwest of Logandale the basal part of the formation, with average
thickness about oo feet, consists of conglomerate made up of stream-worn
bbles and cobbles. This deposit grades upward into sandstone and silt-
stone, tan-colored and greenish, which locally contains small shells of gastro-
pods and fragments of fossil wood. This unit, more than zoo feet thick,
grades upward into a similar thickness of stream-laid gravel, which in turn
grades into coarse fan deposits as much as ,5oo feet thick. East of Glendale
these deposits enclose a mass of Kaibab Limestone more than half a mile
long and fully a quarter of a mile from a possible source in bedrock. West
of Logandale an intact block of Mississippian limestone about ,Soo feet long.

are directly in contact with unsilicified country rock. Some of the
pay shoots are mere bunches or ''pockets,'' On the Velvet claitm,for
example, several thousand dollars' worth of rich ore was found at the
surface, but efforts to find a continuation of this shoot in depth have
thusfar beenfutile. The St. Ives,Simunerone,andConqueror(Tonopah
Club) mines have had similar histories, although this in itself does not
warrant the conclusion that deeper ore bodies may not yet be found in
these properties. The Kendall mine at the time of visit had produced
about $100,000, all from ore within 60 feet of the surface, and the
deeper workings at that time showed no ore worth shipping. The
rich ore of the Sandstorm mine has all come from very irregulnr pay
shoots, which in many cases rest on flat floors of hard, barren, silicified
rhyolite. These bodies are usually
found at the intersection of later
cross fissures with the mmain silicified
ledge. Although some rich ore has
recently been opened at a depth of
100 feet, the bulk of the production
has come from ore within 50 feet of the
surface. The ore bodies first worked
in the Combination mine occurred in
short irregular shoots, most of them.
at points of intersection of two or
more fissure zones and with a tendency
to a vertically elongated or pipelike
form, A sketch plan of one of these
shoots on level A is shown in fig. 8,
and in fig. 9 are represented plans of
shoots on the level below. At
greater depth these irregular pay
shoots appear to come together, and
on level D the deposit is lodelike,
with a length of about 250 feet. About 100 feet of this is shipping
ore, the rest being of milling grade.
The so-called ''No. 2 shoot'' of the Combination mine is, with
the possible exception of the Jumbo pay shoot, the longest and most
regular body of ore known in the district, having been stoped on the
130-foot or B level(fig. 9) for over 300 feet. Moreover, it is separated
by only a short, barren interval from the Reilly ore body, which is
on the same line of fissuring. This pay shoot is the hanging-wall
portion of a shattered silicified ledge, 30 to 40 feet wide, which
strikes northwest and dips northeast at angles ranging from 75f to
0%. The ore, which is up to 6 feet in width, has no walls and
can not always be distinguished by the eye from the barren or
low-grade ledge matter. It lies near, but not atways in contact
Salinity Stwdies,-Salinity measurements of the fluid inclusions in Pennine
minerals were made on a freezing stage consisting of a hexagonal aluminum
cell with a circular inner wall, around which were placed six thermomodules
connected in series. The heat generated on the hot side of the thermomodules
was removed by circulating pre-cooled tap water through copper plates
clamped to the thermomodules. The aluminum cell was fitted with quartz
windows at top and bottom and a thermocouple placed in the cell in close
proximity to the sample, which was supported in the center of the cell. The
entire system was insulated and the cell filled with acetone. It was found that
npplication of a current of 10 amps to the thermomodules resulted in a tempera-
ture of -18' C within the cell, and that above -18' C it was possible to
adjust the temperature in the cell within E: 1' C by varying the current fed
to the thermomodules. Unfortunately it was not possible to obtain tempera-
tures lower than about -18' C with this freezing stage. The stage was
calibrated by measuring the melting temperature of n-dodecane (M,P.
-9.6' C) sealed in glass capillary tubes, and by placing the bulb of a ther-
mometer adjacent to the thermocouple in the cell.
Fluid inclusions generally exhibit considerable super-cooling before freez-
ing (33), consequently each specimen was pre-cooled in a mixture of dry ice
and acetone for 30 minutes and then rapidly transferred to the cooling stage
which was at a temperature of --18* C. By gradually increasing the tem-
perature within the cell, the temperature at which the last ice crystal in an
fnclusion melted could be obtained. These last melting temperatures have
en interpreted in terms of the system NaCl-E,O (Table 3). In some
.stances it was found that the ice crystals in inclusions had already melted
at --18* C, In such cases it has only been possible to place a minimum value
on the salinity of the inclusion contents.
Investigation of the Na/K ratios of Fluid Inclusions,-In order to measure
the relative amounts of Na and K in Pennine fluid inclusions samples of

5. The geographic area to which any
resourcelreserve estimate refers must be defined.
6. All estimates must show a date and author.
7. The reserve base is an encompassing
resource category delineated by physical and
chemical criteria. A major purpose for its recogni-
tion and appraisal is to aid in long-range public and
commercial planning. For most mineral com-
modities, different grades and tonnages, or other
appropriate resource parameters, can be specified
for any given deposit or area, or for the Nation,
depending on the specific objectives of the
estimators; therefore, the position of the lower
boundary of the reserve base, which extends into
the subeconomic category, is variable, depending
on those objectives. The intention is to define a
quantity of in-place material, any part of which
may become economic, depending on the extrac-
tion plans and economic assumptions finally used.
When those criteria are determined, the initial
reserve-base estimate will be divided into three
component parts: reserves, marginal reserves, and
a remnant of subeconomic resources. For the pur-
pose of Federal commodity assessment, criteria for
the reserve base will be established for each com-
modity.
8. Undiscovered resources may be divided in ac-
cordance with the definitions of hypothetical and
speculative resources, or they may be divided in
terms of relative probability of occurrence.
9. Inferred reserves and the inferred reserve
base are postulated extensions of reserves and of
the reserve base. They are identified resources
quantified with a relatively low degree of certainty.
Postulated quantities of resources not based on
reservelreserve-base extensions, but rather on
geologic inference alone, should be classified as un-
discovered.
10. Locally, limited quantities of materials may
be produced, even though economic analysis has in-
dicated that the deposit would be too thin, too low
grade, or too deep to be classified as a reserve. This
situation might arise when the production facilities
are already established or when favorable local cir-
cumstances make it possible to produce material
that elsewhere could not be extracted profitably.
Where such production is taking place, the quanti-
ty of in-place material shall be included in the
reserve base, and the quantity that is potentially
producible shall be included as a reserve. The
profitable production of such materials locally,
however, should not he used as a rationale in other
Mesozoic siliceous and volcanic rocks and Tertisry volcanic rocks,
On the other hand, eastern Nevada is underlain lnrgely by Pre-
cambrian metamorphic and sedimentary rocks and aleozoc car-
bonate rocks locally covered by Tertiary volcanic rocks (Nolan, 1943,
1902).
These differences in rock types of western and eastern Nevada must
reflect fundamental differences within the crust, which nre further
reflected in thhe distinctive metal suites of the two areas, Western
and eastern Nevada accordingly are two distinct metallogenic prov-
inces (see fig. 12); western Nevada contains the major gold, silver,
tungsten, antimony, mercury, and iron deposits thus faar discovered
(Ferguson, 1944; Nolan, 1950). Eastern Nevada contains the major
lead and zinc deposits with associated gold and silver deposits,
The division between the two provinces is not a sharp line, but
rather a broad transitional zone that follows along the 117% meridian
in southern Nevada, and switngs northeastward to the 115% meridian
in the northern part of the State (fig. 12). Deposits withhin the transi-
tional zone include representutives of both provinces; likewise, in
eastern Nevada, the base metal deposits are ringed by precious metal
and antitdmony zones, Major copper deposits may be found in both
provinces; evidently copper is not so directly related to crustal rock
type but may be derived from sources below the crust within the
mantle. The sources of metals and their mode of transport upward
are yet not clearly understood.
Within the two metallogenic provinces in Nevada, regional struc-
tural and lithologic controls were important in localizing districts and
ore bodies, On figures 13 and 14 it appears that a number of districts
are localized along northwest and northeast trends. These mineral
belts in Nevada have been discussed briefly by Roberts (1957, 1960).
One extends from Battle Mountain to Eureka; along this belt (Roberts,
1960, p. 18) detuiled mapping has shown that the major ore bodies
occur umn windows of carbonate rocks through the upper plate of the
Roberts Mountains thrust and in association with intrusive rocks
(fig. 14). The windows represent domal uplifts that began in the
Fennsylvanian and were accentuated during intrusive activity in
Mlesozoic or early Tertiary time, The northwest aalinement of win-
dows and associnted ore deposits suggests some major structural con-
trol for both the domul uplifts and mineral belts. Except for the
arching, no displacement is noted along the belt; moreover, the
Paaleozoic and Mesozoic facies do not seem to be displaced along the
belts and it is therefore infcrred that thhe belts are ancient structural
features that may be of Precambrian age.
Metallization along the belts varies considerahly in type and kind.
In the Battle Mountain-Eureka belt, for example, ore deposits in the
Osgood Mountains area, 35 miles northwest of Battle Mountain,
include gld, mercury, and tungsten deposits; at Battle Mountain,
copper, gold, and lead-zinc-silver deposits; at Cortcz, silver, lead, and
zinc deposits, and at the Buclhorn district, 6 miles east of Cortez,
gold deposits (Vanderburg, 1938; H. Masursky, oral communication,
1963). These occurrences may reflect zoning of metals, different metal-
logenic provinces, metallization at different titmes, or different levels of
erosion, The tungsten and mercury deposits in the Osgood Moun-
tains are characteristic of the western metallogenic province ; the silver-

T. 36 N., R. 36 E.), 11 miles northwest of Winnemucca, in Humboldt
County, also has produced antimony as a byproduct. However, un-
like the Potosi mine and Arabia district above, tetrahedrite is the only
primary antimony mineral present. Approximately 200 tons of
antimony have been recovered from lead-zinc-copper ores mined from
veins that strike N. 20 E. to N. 50% W. and vary from a few inches to
several feet in width. They consist mainly of quartz with lesser
amounts of calcite, tetrahedrite, sphalerite, galena, pyrite, arseno-
pyrite, and yellow antimony oxides, Concentrates shipped in 1942
averaged 2 percent antimony, 0.6 ounces of gold and 50 to 60 ounces o
silver per ton, in addition to the lead, zinc, and copper. The wallrock
is slate.

sill, in some places following the hanging wall and elsewhere following
the footwall. The sill intrudes shale and limestone of the Triassie
Star Peak Formation. Pods, blebs, and veinlets of stibnite occur in
the quartz vein and in the silicified and sercitized sill. Some arseno-
pyrite, pyrite, and sphalerite are associated with the stibnite. In the
mmediate vicinity of the Antimony King mine, the I.E.S. and Ar.
rance mines (No. 3) have produced some 50 tons of antimony from
quite similar deposits along this sill, and a second parallel sill.
The Last Chance mine (No. 62) on the divide (sec. 17, T. 10 N.,
I. 42 E.) between Wall and San Pablo Canyons, on the east flank of
the Toiyabe Range, Nye County, produced 192 tons of antimony
during World War I and II. Several veins, consisting of brecciated
wall rock, gouge, some quartz, calcite, stibnite, and pyrite, and minor
tetrahedrite, cut highly contorted Permian(7) limestone and shale.
The main vein strikes N. 70* E. and dips 45* to 55* NW. Several
rhyolite porphyry dikes intrude the sedimentary rocks.
The Cottonwood Canyon mine (No. 42) in Little Cottonwood
Canyon, (ec. 35, T. 32 N., R. 48 E. and sec. 2, T. 31 N., R. 48 E),
on the east flank of Antler Peak, in Lander County, has produced
156 tons of antimony. A main vein with several splits strikes N.
15 to 30% E. and dips 45% to s0 W. in a north-trending fault zone
cutting Mississippian argillite, shale, quartzite, and chert. A quartz-
porphyry dike intrudes the sediments. East-trending faults offset both
the fault zone and vein. The vein is up to 48 inches wide, and con-
tains abundant quartz and gouge, with some calcite, stibnite, and
pyrite.
Antimony occurrences that have produced less than a hundred tons
are shown on figure 16 and described by Lawrence (1963). Several
are of special interest because of unusual features or associations.
At the Oreana (Little Tungsten) mine (No. 80), south of Rocky
Canyon (sec. 3, T. 29 N., R. 33 E.) on the western flank of the Hum-
boldt Range, Fershing County, rare native antimony is associated
with scheelite and beryl in a quartz-oligoclase-albite-phlogopite
pegmatite body. At Steamboat Springs (No. 98), 10 miles south of
Reno in Washoe County, stibnite and ''metastibnite'' occur with
aODUcTION AND OUTLOO
Nevada is the fifth largest gold-producing State, with a total output
af 27,057,000 ounces from 1859 to 1962. The State ranked seventh
in production in 1962, when only 62,863 ounces were mitned.
The gold mining industry in Nevada exemplifies the general trend
of gold production in the United States, which has steadily declined
from a high of more than 4,5 million ounces in 1940 to 1.5 million
ounces in 1962 (U.S. Bureau of Mines preliminary data), the lowest
peacetime output since 1884. This may be contrasted with the world
gold production of 50 million ounces in 1962, a record high. Factors
responsible for diminishing production of gold in the United States are
the gradual depletion of high-grade deposits and constantly increasing
costs under a fixed selling price of $35 per ounce. As a result of this
situation, a steadily increasing portion of domestic gold output is a
byproduct of base metal mines.
Figure 24 shows Nevada's gold-mining history since 1880 in terms
of annual production. Most of the bonanza production of the Com-
stock (No. 67, fig. 23) occurred before systematic annual records were
kept; consequently, the impact of this district cannot be shown, The
high production from 1906 to 1916 is due mainly to the tremendous
output of Goldfield (No. 12) during this period. After the decline of
Goldfield, gold mining generally waned in the 1920's and early 1930'a,
but during this period there occurred a marked transition in the source
of gold from predominantly gold-bearing lodes to byproduct gold,
mainly from the copper ores of Ely (No. 70). With the increase in
the price of gold from 820.67 to $35 per ounce in 1934, interest in gold
mining was renewed, and many lode districts were reopened. The
large output of the Getchell mine in Potosi district (No. 25) is re-
flected in the peak of almost 400,000 ounces in 1940. The post-World
War II period hias been one of general diminishing activity, marked
by short-lived spurts of production due to large-scale placer operations
at Round MIountain (No. 57), large-scale open pit mining at the
Goldacres pit in the Bullion district (No. 29), and at the Getchell
mine (No. 25), in addition to significant sustained amounts of by-
product gold from Ely.
Under current high costs, plus the fixed price of gold, a revival of
gold mining in Nevada comparable to the 1906-16 era hardly seems
likely. The known rich bonanza ore bodies are, for the most part,
eshausted. Any significant increase in gold output will probably be
either from byproduct gold or from large-scale mining of low-grade
lode or placer gold deposits. Rejuvenation of silver and silver-lead
mining in such districts as Comstocl, Tonopah, and Eureka, or a
sharp increase in copper output at Ely would most certainly boost gold
Droduction to several times its current rate,
The closing of the Goldacres open pit mine in 1961 marked the
end of significant production from lode gold mines in Nevada; how-
ever, the recent resumption of activity at the Getchell mine in the
Fotosi district may very well herald a new approach to gold mining
Wherein high costs are combated by bold and imaginative planning
and a willingness to invest in and develop techniques for mining large
lOw-grade ore bodies, for extracting gold and all useful byproducts
Irom complex ores, and for exploring for concealed ore bodies.

It secms likely that with certain adsorbates (e.g. saturated hydrocarbons)
on metals, the elcctrostatic contribution may actually constitute the major
portion of the total adsorption energy (ca 5-00 kcal mole'' '); but with non-
polar molecules adsorbed on insulators it is probably quite small (e.g. for
argon on potassium chloride, U(a) is probably about 0-250 kcal mole' ')
ecept on particularly active spots such as the edges or corners of crystals,
or regions of crystal imperfection.
From consideration of equation (1.T) it is clear that if adsorption involves
predominantly dispersion forccs, the adsorption energy will be numerically
high in creviccs and pores of the solid, where each adsorbate molecule is
close to an enhanccd number of atoms of the solid. Calculations by de Boer
and Custerg''? showed that the maximum enbancement is to be expected
in long and narrow capillaries and in small spherical cavities; and that the
interaction potential has its lowest value for a molecule situated on the top
of a projection. Adsorption should therefore occur preferentially in the
smallest pores of the solid.
The picture is different, however, if the electrostatic contribution is
considerable and the face of the crystal is heterionic (i,e. if positive and
negative ions alternate there, as in the l00 face of potassium chloride). Within
a narrow pore the alternating positive and negative charges will tend to
compensate each other so that the electrostatic field will be weakened
whereas on a prominence the canccllation effect will be much lesst. 'Thus
the dispersion and electrostatic potentials will be affected in opposite senses
by the prominences and depressions, so that the force field over the surface
as a whole will tend to be smoothed out: the tendency of the adsorbate
molecules to seek out the fine pores and to shun the prominences will be
diminished.
Adsorption Forces-Conclusion
The general picture which emerges from our consideration of pbysical
adsorption forces acting between a solid and a molecule of adsorbate gas or
vapour, is somewhat as follows: dispersion forces are always present and,
unless the adsorbate molecule possesses a strong dipole moment, will
represent the major contribution to the total energy of adsorption. Their
dependence on distance is such that the first layer of adsorbed molecules will
be strongly held, and higher layers more weakly so with an energy not much

In view of the importance of the value of parameter c in the present context,
values for various solids are quoted in Table 2.22. The systems near the top
of the table will tend to have an ill-defined point B with consequent uncer-
tainty in the monolayer capacity. On thie other hand, thie systems near the
bottom of the table where the values of c are high will tend to show strong
localization so that the value of A, will depend greatly on the nature of the
adsorbent, in extreme cases being determined by the lattice parameters of the
solid.
The use of krypton to determine the surface area of evaporated metal
films, which has become widespread in recent yearg' ' :7; is attended by
complications arising out of the difficulty of extending the measurements over
a sufficiently wide range of relative pressure. A clear point B has been
reported by Brennan et a!.P''! gt very low relative pressure (--0-01), and a
moderately well-defined point B has been found by other workerg - 1; jy

whcther, on one and the same system, both of these points would be found
thus in cffect giving rise to a step-wise isotherm.

Pressure readings, in terms of liquid head, are obtained by
connecting the piezometers through a manifold to an
inclined manometer, as shown photographically in figure 2
and schematically in figure 3. Differences in pneumatic head
between each piezometer and the atmosphere are made by
opening the manifold valve connecting that piezometer to
the manometer, all the other manifold valves being closed.
Zero manometer readings are obtained by opening the
manifold to atmosphere. The change in atmospheric
pressure during the test is measured with a microbarograph
and (or) a surveying altimeter.
Under field conditions, a manometer inclined at a 10:1
slope and filled with fluid of specific gravity 1.20 (commer-
cial manometer fluid for outdoor use) has been found to give
readings accurate to about 0.25 mm (0.01 inch), which is
equivalent to about 30 mm (0.I foot) of pneumatic head. A
760 mm (30-inch) manometer, having a range of 76 mm (3
inches) is adequate to measure pneumatic head differences
under most conditions. Because downhole pneumatic head
will sometimes be less than that at land surface, it is desirable
to establish, by slightly overfilling the manometer-fluid
reservoir, a reading of about 13 mm (0.5 inch) at zero
DATA OBTAINED
Data required for the method include curves or tables of
pneumatic head versus time at each depth during a period
when atmospheric pressure is changing. During the in-
vestigation, it was found to be most convenient to obtain
these data during a normal afternoon barometric decline. In
most of the areas where tests were run, such a pressure
decline usually is equivalent to 3 to 4 millibars or about 30 to
36 m of pneumatic head in 4 to 5 hours. Generally, when
determining the downhole response to diurnal barometric
changes, differences in pneumatic head between each depth
and land surface are measured in terms of liquid head at
about 15-minute intervals. Readings generally are started at
about 10 or ll a,m., when the barometer is normally quite
stable, as such readings provide good initial conditions for
the analysis. The readings generally are continued through
the afternoon decline until 6 or 7 p.m., when a diurnal
barometric rise normally occurs.
For electric-analog analysis, the measured pneumatic
head differences are added algebraically to the absolute
pneumatic head, as determined from a microbarograph or
an altimeter. The resultant pneumatic head values can be
plotted versus time to produce a family of curves(fig. 4), one
curve for each piezometer and one for atmospheric pressure,
To apply equation 9, the arithmetic average clay content was
determined from data on all of the samples collected and
tested from a given layer. This average value was used to
represent CMC in the equation. Use of the arithmetic
average was arbitrary, and may not be completely ap-
propriate because it assigns too little weight to the effects of
wetting on the discrete clay layers within each interval.
However, the worth of the correction for the effects of
wetting would be questionable no matter what averaging
scheme was used.
Results of applying equation 9 to compute corrected
hydraulic conductivities are listed in table 4. The results
appear reasonable for the top two layers, but not for the
bottom four layers. Moreover, the apparent agreement
between the corrected air-permeability results and the
recharge-based hydraulic conductivity for the surface layer
may be fortuitous. The surface layer probably is indeed more
sensitive to the effects of wetting than the deeper layers, as
described above. However, the laboratory-based correction
factor was determined on samples mainly collected at depth,
and thus is not necessarily relevant for the surface layer data.
Agreement of the corrected air-permeability-based
hydraulic conductivity with the recharge-based value for the
8-15-meter layer also seems fortuitous, as the massive caliche
in this zone should not be structurally affected by wetting.
Failure of the correction scheme to improve the
air-permeability-based hydraulic conductivity estimates for
the bottom four layers may result from flow occurring
through secondary porosity features, such as cracks and
joints, rather than through the intergranular porosity. Thus
the laboratory results, which include effects of wetting on
permeability related to intergranular porosity only, might
not be relevant.
Additional experience with the air-permeability technique
will be needed to reconcile whether, or under what con-
ditions, a correction for the effects of wetting is warranted
for layers at depth. On the other hand, sufficient experience
has been gained to indicate that K-values of the near-surface
materials generally would need to be corrected for the effects
of wetting. Such a correction could be practically developed
if the ratio of air-permeability-based to recharge-based
hydraulic conductivity could be correlated with some readily
measurable property of the near-surface materials.

added to the tanks was adjusted for chianges in soil moisture during the month.
The depth to water was held between 5 and 6 ft below land surface.
As a result of the general increase of vegetation in each of the tanks,
water use during 1964 greatly exceeded that used during 1963. The pattern of
vegetation development was not the same for each tank, however, so the rela-
tion between data for pairs of individual tanks was continually changing. In
1965, the plants were approaching maturity, and the volume of vegetation
increased only slightly.
A search of the literature indicated that water-use data for arrowwoed
were lacking prior to the current studies at Yuma. The data now available
indicate that under favorable conditions, arrowweed will use as much water
as saltcedar, which has long been known for its high rate of water use.
Saltlush,-GOuailbrush (Atriplex lentiformis) was grown in tanks 1 and 2,
and four-wlng saltbusl1 (Ntriplex canescens) was grown in tank 3. 'T1o s;lt-
bush was established both by transplanting and seeding. Depth1 to water was
held at 3 to 4 ft below land surface, in 1962, and nearly constant at 5.5 ft
during 1963 and 1964.
The quailbrush made most of its growth during 1963, the average volume
ot the two tanks increasing from 1,050 cu ft in December, 1962, to 5,650 cu
ft in October, 1963. Although the average volume of vegetation increased to
6,240 cu ft by September, 1964, and 7,030 by August 6, 1965, the volume of
foliage actively transpiring may have been less (see Fig. 3). Growth in tank
1 was more vigorous than in tank 2 during 1964. The consumptive use, shown
in Table 8, does not include precipitation but is adjusted for soil-moisture
changes during the month.
Four-wing saltbush, grown in tank 3, is smaller and slower in growth than
quailbrush. This plant will exist as a xerophyte, but appears to grow and pro-
duce seed only whnen moisture is sufficient to mmeet minimum needs. Th1e
greatest growth of vegetation in the tank was made during 1963, when the
volume increased from 1,290 to 2,290 cu ft. The volume was 2,770 cu ft on
September 24, 1964, and 3,080 on August 6, 1965. The water use, shown ii
Table 8 and Fig. 4, was significantly less during 1964 and 1965, essentially
because of the maturation of the plants.

is that they have a high degree of directionality, which is conferred by the
characteristic arrangement of the bonding orbitals of the hydrogen and
oNygen atoms (Fig. 3.1). Hydrogen bonds also possess a specific bond
length, which differs from one type of H bond to another, depending on the
structural geometry and the electron distribution in the molecules involved.
In ice, each water molecule is hydrogen-bonded: the length of the hydrogen
bond is 1.77 A. Hydrogen bonds, therefore, form and remain stable only
under specific geometrical conditions.
Water is of course not the only substance capable of hydrogen bonding.
Ammonia, hydrogen fluoride, and alcohols also exhibit hydrogen bonds
(i,e., exposed hydrogen nuclei in these compounds are attracted by concen-
trations of negative charges on adjacent molecules). Molecules of many
compounds, in fact, are so structured that one part has an excess of positive
and the other part an excess of negative charges. All such molecules are
called polar, since they act somewhat like minute magnets and are charac-
terized by a dipole moment (a measure of the tendency of a polar molecule to
be affected by an electrical or magnetic field). The uniqueness of water lies in
the ease with which its molecules form extended, three-dimensional hy-
drogen-bonded aggregates.
D. States of Water
In the vapor or gaseous state, water molecules are largely independent of
one another and occur mostly as monomers signified as (H,O), Occasionally,
colliding molecules may fuse to form dimers, (H4O);, or even trimers,
(H4O)4, but such combinations are rare.
In the solid state, at the other extreme, a rather rigidly structured lattice
forms with a tetrahedral configuration (Fig. 3.2) which can be schematically
represented as sheets of puckered hexagonal rings (Fig. 3.3). In actual fact,
as many as nine alternative structures, or ice forms, can occur when water
freezes, depending on prevailing temperature and pressure conditions which
can be charted in phase diagrams. Figure 3.3 pertains to ice I, the familiar
form which occurs and is stable at ordinary atmospheric pressure.
The orderly structure of ice does not totally disappear in the liquid state',
as the molecules do not become entirely independent of one another. The
polarity and hydrogen bonds continue to bond water molecules together,
where p, is the average particle density.
Bulk density is generally measured by means of a core sampler designed to
extract ''undisturbed'' samples of known volume from various depths in the
profile. An alternative is to measure the volumes and masses of individual
clods (not including interclod cavities) by immersion in mercury or by coating
with paraffin wax prior to immersion in water. Still other methods are the
sand-fiunnel and balloon technigues used in engineering, and gamma-ray
attenuation densitometry (Blake, 1965).
Pore-size distribution measurements can be made in coarse-grained soils
by means of the pressure-intrusion method (Diamond, 1970), in which a
nonwetting liquid, generally mercury, is forced into the pores of a predried
sample. The pressure is applied incrementally, and the volume pentrated by
the liquid is measured for each pressure step, equivalent (by the capillary
theory)to a range of pore diameters. In the case of fine-grained soils, capillary
condensation methods, or, more commonly, desorption methods are used
(Vomocil, 1965). In the desorption method, a presaturated sample is sub-
jected to a stepwise series of incremental suctions, and the capillary theory
is used to obtain the equivalent pore-size distribution. Water is commonly
used as the permeating liquid, though nonpolar liquids have also been tried
in an attempt to assess, by the comparison, the possible effect of water satura-
tion and desorption in modifying soil structure. Where the aggregates are
fairly distinct, it is sometimes possible to divide pore-size distribution into
two distinguishable ranges, namely macropores and micropores. The macro-
pores are mostly the interaggregate cavities which serve as the principal
avenues for the infiltration and drainage of water and for aeration. The
micropores are the intraaggregate capillaries responsible for the retention of
water and solutes. However, the demarcation is seldom truly distinct, and
the separation between macropores and micropores is often arbitrary.
The shapes of aggregates observable in the field (illustrated in Fig. 6.5) can
be classified as follows:
(1) Platy: Horizontally layered, thin and flat aggregates resembling
wafers. Such structures occur, for example, in recently deposited clay soils.
(2) Prismatic or columnar: Vertically oriented pillars, often six sided,
G. Hydraulic Conductivity, Permeability, and Fluidity
The hydraulic conductivity, again, is the ratio of the flux to the hydraulic
gradient, or the slope of the flux versus gradient curve (Fig. 8.8).
With the dimensions of flux being LT '', those of hydraulic conductivity
depend on the dimensions assigned to the driving force (the potential
gradient). In the last chapter, we showed that the simplest way to express the
potential gradient is by use of length, or head, units. The hydraulic head
gradient H/L, being the ratio of a length to a length, is dimensionless.'
Accordingly, the dimensions of hydraulic conductivity are the same as the
dimensions of flux, namely LT T*. If, on the other hand, the hydraulic
gradient is expressed in terms of the variation of pressure with length, then
the hydraulic conductivity assumes the dimensions of M *8UT. Since the
latter is cumbersome, the use of head units is generally preferred.
In a saturated soil of stable structure, as well as in a rigid porous medium
such as sandstone, for instance, the hydraulic conductivity is characteris-
tically constant. Its order of magnitude is about 10T10% cm/sec in a
sandy soil and 10*--10T' cm/sec in a clayey soil.
wherein, as previously defined, the convective flux of the solution ; is equal to
the product of average velocity and volume fraction of the solution; ie.,
g =ü6.
The adsorption of ions in the soil can be positive, as is the attachment of
cations to clay surfaces, or negative, as is the repulsion or partial exclusion
of anions from the electrostatic double layer of the same clay. This, inciden-
tally, is why anions in a solution tend to travel somewhat faster than cations
when an electrolytic solution is passed through a soil, as the cations undergo
exchange phenomena within the soil's cation exchange complex and are
retarded in the process. If the attainment of equilibrium between the ions in
the solution phase and the soil's exchange complex is rapid enough to be
considered instantaneous, then the amount adsorbed A can be taken as
dependent only on the concentration c of the soil solution. Assuming that
storage outside the solution phase is due entirely to adsorption (i.e., no
other storage mechanisms, such as precipitation of a component of limited
solubility), then the amount in storage o, is equal to A. Using these assump-
tions, Eq. (10.23) can be rewritten

with the numerical and modeling expertise. Prob-
ably the single most important factor limiting the
successful application of unsaturated flow theory to
actual field problems is the lack of information re-
garding the parameters entering the governing transfer
equations, Reliable estimates of the unsaturated hy-
draulic conductivity are especially difficult to ob-
tain, partly because of its extensive variability in the
field, and partly because measuring this parameter is
time-consuming and expensive. Several investigators
have, for these reasons, used models for calculating
the unsaturated conductivity from the more easily
measured soil-water retention curve. Very popular
among these models has been the Millington-Quirk
method (Millington and QQuirk, 1961), various forms
of which have been applied with some success in a
number of studies (cf. Jackson et al., 1965: [ackson,
1972; Green and Corey, 1971: Bruce, 1972). Un-
fortunately, this method has the disadvantage of pro-
ducing tabular results which, for example when ap-
plied to nonhomogeneous soils in multidimensional
unsaturated flow models, are quite tedious to use.
Closed-form analytical expressions for predicting
Recently Mualem (1976a) derived a new model toy
predicting the hydraulic conductivity from knowledge
of the soil-water retention curve and the conductivity
at saturation. Mualem's derivation leads to a simple
integral formula for the unsaturated hydraulic con-
ductivity which enables one to derive closed-form
analytical expressions, provided suitable equations for
the soil-water retention curves are available. It is the
PWrpose of this paper to derive such expressions using
an equation for the soil-water retention curve which
is both continuous and has a continuous slope. The
resulting conductivity models generally contain three
independent parameters which may be obtained by
matching the proposed soil-water retention curve to
experimental data. Results obtained with the closed-
form equations based on the Mualem theory will be
compared with observed data for a few soils having
widely varying hydraulic properties.
dump site in the State of Nevada? For years low-level
radioactive waste has been shipped to Beatty. Because of
no enforcement of proper packaging of radioactive waste
by shippers and continual reports of leaking packaging,
efforts to close the Beatty dump site have been going on
for the past few years. After all the powers that be
agreed to close this dump site, we now must wait a couple
more years until Colorado builds its own dump site, and
then we can close ours. Simultaneously research proposals
to study the long-term effects of low-level radioactive
exposure on the health of the population of Nevada have
been submitted the past few years, and all have been
rejected for funding. At present we have no knowledge
what the effects of low-level radiation exposure may have
upon us. I've just mentioned two instances of national
and statewide unconcern for the public's health because
it raises some serious questions regarding a high-level
radioactive dump site in Nevada. And frankly, the term
''repository'' is a euphemism I resent. It's a dump site.
The first question I am posing to you has
to do with the protection of the people of Nevada. Since i
the American public is a bit disillusioned with the honesty
of our governmental agencies -- and I won't bother citing
all the examples or even a few of them, I think you're all
familiar with them -- I'm asking you, what outside monitorin;

The limts established by EPA for he
perod of repository operattons sppear
at 40 CFR 191.03. The hmts ppitcable
to the perod after disposel include
''contanment requrements'' (limIts on

$ 191.13.''indvdual protection
requrements'' n i 19t.1$ and ''ground
water protection requirstments'' in
} 191.18. Lmplementation of each of
these sections is d1scussed n the
followng paragraphs.
Standards for repository operations
/$ 191.071L The standards for repositor-'
operations are virtually identical to the
standards previously promulgated by
EPA for the urannium fel cycle [42 FR
28&0. January 1). 1977], and wll be
mplemented In hhe same manner. ' DOE
wll be expected to demonstrate.
through analyses of anticipered facility
performance. that the dose limits of
these stsndards, as well ss the
standards for protectton agaunst
radiation set out um 10 CFR Psrt 20. will
not be exceeded. Releases of
rsdionuclides and resulting doses duning
operations are amenable to daonitoing,
and DOE wll be requred to conduct z
nontorng program to confirm that the
1mts are complied wth. Sectton
X0.111(a) would be amended to includes
he EPA dose himts, Sectuon 50.101(aj(2)
1lready includes a provision requinnng
'ressonable assursnce'' thet the relesse
1mts be schieved, 4nd it is not
necesssry to repest this language in the
release limits of i 60.111. It is 4lso not
necessary to employ the terms
''management' and''storage.' as EPA
has done, suce all preclosure repostory
operations are already sub;ect to the
provsons of i 80.111.
Postclosurs standords. The EPA
postclosure standards are all expressed
in terms of s ''reasonable expectatton''
of meeting pecified levels of
performance. EPA expiaumed that 1t
selected th1s term because'''ressonable
assurance has came to be associated
wth a level of confidence that may not
be spproprate for the very long-term
analytical projections that sre called for
by 191.13.'' The Commission is sensittve
to the need to account for the
uncertaunties unvolved in predicting
performance over 10.CC0 yesrs, and he
duficulties ss well as the umportance of
dong so. The Commssion has
attempted to address this concen un the
exstumg language of i 8O.101(4)(2). That
section requures e finding of reasonabie
assurance.''making allowance for the
tume pen1od, hatards, and uncertaunties
nvolved. that the outcome w1ll be in
conforfmance'' wnth the relevant citeris.
Rather than adopt sn additional concept
such as ''reasonable expectation.'' the
Commusson proposes to add additional
explanatory text, deIved from EPA's
wordung, to its exustung discusson of
resonable assursnce. This text wul
make clear the Comm1sson's belief that
1t3 concept of ressonable assurance,
althowgh somewhat different rom
previous ussge un resctor licensuig, is
appropr1ate for evaiuations of repository
performance whers long-term issues and
substantial uncertaunties are nberent n
projections of repository performance.
The Commission connsiders that the lerel
of confidence 4ssoctated wnth its
concept of reasonable assurance is the
same 4s that wought by EPA u: the use of
the term ''ressonabie expectation.'

e. $hoN Slkinng
Some commenters suggested that the
regulation hould be amended to require .
that DOE may not proceed te
characteze sites by sinking shafts untl
NRC and State revew and comment
upon he SCP 4re complete. One .
commenter suggested that he regulation
be clanfied to specify that completion of
NC review is not a condition precedent
for ha sinking. The Commission
agrees with the commenters who regsrd
NWPA as requining hst DOE defer he
sinking of shafts at lesst until such time
as there has been an opportunity for
pertunent comzments on shaft 1inking to
heve been solicited and considered by
DOE. As tated n hhe presmble to the
proposed rule,'The Commission
believes that Congess intended thet
DOE should provide tthe plans
sufficiently far n advance so thet
comments may be developed nd
submurted beck io DOE early enough to
be considered when shaft sinking
occurs, snd alll times heresfter.'' The
question, herefore, ie not whether the
Commission agrees wth thhe objective of
those commenters to defer shaft sinkang
untd sfter comments on the SG? heve
been received by DOE. The issus. '
rather, wes whether the Commission
should include in its own regulations an
interpretauon of he obligations of DOE
under the ttatute. The Commssion hes
concluded that it should do so, in he
interests of hufilling its owm
responsblities more effectively.The
Commsson hss ttressed the
importance of evaluating sllenatives ie
major design festures hhat are importsnt
to waste solstion see 10 CFR
eo.21(c)(1)(i)(Dl, snd uus the csse of he
desg and location of he shafts thia
csn only be done prior to their sinking. It
is importsnt to the Commisaion that the
comments which ii may provide to DOE
with respect to thaft inking be taken
inte sccount as tthe Department
proceeds.
The Ccmmission observes that the
incorporation of this language unto he
regulation should have no effect on the
repostory progrsm. Uf the estsblished
workung 4rrangements including the ' '
Procedural Agreement 4e FR 5I876
described in he presmble to the
proposed rule] provide the anticipated
information exchange. NRC would in
fact be sble to review snd comment in s
timely fsshion dunumg DOE's esrly
plannung processes on those ssues that
may have s bearing upon DOE's
dec1sion to proceed wnth, or delay, the
sinking of repostory shafts, Moreover.
the Commission is sware that DOE itsellf
has ndicated its intention to wsit until it
has cormpleted a revtew of comments
befors procesding to sink shafs.
d. Slmultaneous Pramugation of
Amendmenta
Some commenters recommended that
all revsions to Psrt 80 and Part 5i to
conform them te the NWPA should be
promulgated simultsneously. ln
particular. they recoaumended that the
revisions concernung NEPA
requirements sccompany the revisions
currently being promulgsted, They
believe that this would sssure that s
comprehensive and integrsted approach
is tsken and any confusion regsrduM3
NWPA and NEPA requurements would
be eliminated. They srgue that much of
Pgrt 60 now rests on NEPA authoity so
thet failure to include NEPA n the
currently proposed revision casts a
cloud over the Commisson's vew of its
authority to carry out esrly tite reviews.
The Commsson hss not put off
considering its obligstions under NEPA
as modfied by hhe NWPA. In

PRELIMINAR Y
In conjunction with developing this level of detail, the
phased timing for release of supporting test descriptions and
procedures was discussed and clarified. Any test descriptions
and procedures which were available at the time the SCP was
issued and which supported the investigation level discussion of
testing contained in SCP could be released for review with the
SCP. Other test descriptions and procedures would be prepared as
required by test schedules to allow for review by DOE, NRC and
States prior to starting any test. Again, inherent in this agree-
ment is the understanding that detailed test descriptions and
procedures for all testing to be conducted in the exploratory
shaft must be available and reviewed before beginning construc-
tion of the shaft. Presentation of such phased groupings of test
descriptions and procedures g9949 be included in periodic
progress reports, but need not necessarily be tied to these
progress reports. Figure 6 was developed to represent the
results of this dicussion.
Further definition of an overall issue resolution strategy was
held pending Tuesday' s discussion of performance allocation. To
initiate this discussion, Felton Bingham presented NNWSI' s
approach for implementing performance allocation. This approach
had previously been presented to DOE HQ staff and endorsed as a
effective method for implementing performance allocation.
NNWSI's presentation raised a number of concerns from the group,
such as concern over the difficulty in changing the performance
goals that might be set initially, and objections to the use of
such terms as ''allocation,'' ''goal,'' and ''confidence'', which have
standard statistical meanings. On the subject of revising
initial performance allocations, the group was referred to the
Summary of NRC/DOE Meeting on Subsystem Performance Allocation,
signed and dated on September 27, 1986 (see Attachment C).
Because presentation of NNWSI' s approach was more detailed than
that of SRPO or BWIP, detailed interactive discussions and com-
parisons were difficult and there were many questions on assump-
tions and process. However, BWIP and SRPO both saw merit in the
NNWSI approach. They believed that it was complimentary and
consistent with their evolving approaches. They indicated that
they wished to review the approach critically and discuss with
NNWSI both details of the approach and the success that NNWSI was
having in implementing it. Project representatives agreed in
concept with HQ that the site-specific performance allocation
strategies should be as consistent as possible. They agreed to
work toward extensive commonality, but emphasized that it was
important not to over-constrain the performance allocation
approaches at this early stage of their development, as the
approaches were new and would be changing as they were refined.
For performance assessment uses, refer to specific performance
assessment analyses (described in Section 8.3.5 of the SCP) which
will use the information produced from the studies described
above, and refer to any use of the results for model validation;
For design uses, refer to, or describe, where the information
from the study described above will be used in construction
equipment design and development and engineering system design
and development (e.g., waste package, repository engineered
barriers, and shafts and borehole seals) : and
For characterization uses, refer to, or describe, where the
information from the study described above will be used in
planning other characterization activities.
Schedule and Milestones:
Provide the durations of and interrelationships among the
principal activities associated with conducting the study (e.g.,
preparation of test procedures, test set-ups, testing, data
analyses, preparation of reports), and indicate the key
milestones including decision points associated with the study
activities;
Describe the timing of this study relative to other studies and
other program activities that will affect, or will be affected
by, the schedule for completion of the subject study: and

Figure 8.3.5.16-1 shows the phases of the DOE's performance confirmat.5n
program relative to the stages of the overall repository prgram, The DCE' s
performance confirmation program, as discussed earlier, is divided into base-
line and confirmation phases, with the submittal of the license application
serving as a convenient demarcation between phases. Before the license
application, site characterization testing provides for baseline data on site
conditions important to repository design and performance, monitoring of
changes in those conditions as a result of site characterization, predictions
of changes in those conditions as a result of construction and operation, and
predictions of repository performance after closure.
With the submittal of the license application, the DOE begins the formal
licensing process with the NRC. The license application will present the
performance assessments intended to show that repositcry performance will
satisfy the regulatory postclosure performance objectives and will also
present the data on site conditions upon which the repository design and
performance assessments are based. Further data gathering activities after
the application is submitted are intended to be confirmatory or for other
purposes, such as design optimization.
A subset of the testing conducted during site characterization to
support the resolution of the performance and design issues in the license
application will provide the baseline data needed to meet the requirements of
10 CFR 60.140 (d) (2), (3). This includes baseline data on the parameters
important to design and performance, as well as data on natural processes
that may be changed by site characterization, construction, and operational
activities. All the activities presently required to obtain this baseline
information are included in the site19[Aracterization program, and the
information needed is identified ingtwd'performance allocation tables. If,
based on data and other information gathered during site characterization,
the need for additional baseline information is identified, the baseline
phase of the performance confirmation program will be appropriately expanded
or otherwise modified.
Some of the site characterization activities that also meet requirements
of 10 CFR 60.140 (d) (2) and (3) for performance confirmation during the base-
line phase will be continued past the license application submittal date, if
continuation of these activities would produce useful data of a confirmatory
nature. Such activities fall into two general categories: (1) long-term
monitoring of natural processes, events, or site conditions (e .g., seismic
monitoring and monitoring of unsaturated zone hydrologic parameters) and
(2) long-duration in situ testing to characterize processes and evaluate
conceptual models (e .g., in situ testing of flow processes in the unsaturated
zone). These activities are also consistent with and would support the
requirements of 10 CFR 60.141 for confirmation of geotechnical and design
parameters during construction and operation. Data collected from such
activities during characterization would be used in licensing assessments.
Tables 8.3.5.16-1 and -2 1ist the testing and monitoring activities in
each of the above categories that have been te:. .tively identified. Included
in the tables are the test titles, locations, purposes, value for performance
or design confirmation, approximate dates, and the SCP section that provides

Sincerely,
Thank you for inquiring with Dive Training Magazine about BTSI's award winning Diamond
Reef'Precision Buoyancy Training program (full page ad, p.81 August issue). This scientifically
designed objective circuit training system (see below diagram) is being used worldwide by
educators representing all training organizations. If your favorite dive center is not listed in our
August full page ad, I would then ask you to speak with the owner or their director of training
so they may better realize that there does exist a more comprehensive and effective training
program to teach diving, and that you are interested in participating. The curriculum is straight
forward, inexpensive and requires that the educator takes more time with each diver to scrutinize
their techniques and any diving equipment needs. You will realize immediate benefits from this
state of the art higher education program. Courses can be easily customized to fit your schedule
or your level of expertise (from novice to expert, or night diving and wreck diving to U/W
photography).
We guarantee our program 100% to our dealers so they have everything to gain by incorporating
this program. Our goal is to provide them with the tools to better serve you, in order to make
you safer, more confident and your open water diving experience more comfortable. Some non-
dealers have chosen to cut corners and make cheap imitations of this government tested and
sanctioned program. Imitations are potentially dangerous and offer you no recognizable benefit.
You can distinguish non-dealers right away by asking if they distribute the Official Diamond
Reef' validation system. It is the world's only proof of diving skill and will provide you with
prestigious obfective credentials to offer new dive buddies and will give you more leverage to
dive more pristine diving areas while on vacation. Certification cards never expire aid do not
offer any objective proof of buoyancv skill. Hovering and Non-destructive Maneuvering'' are
the two most important buoyancy skills in diving to master. I will be happy to send a complete
information packet to your favorite dive center if there isn't a Diamond Reef' Training Center
close to you. Diving is so much more fun whhen you're good at it, and our highly trained dealers
will get you there faster. Thank you again for contacting BTSI.

SYSTAT products.
SYSTAT 5D for Windows takes full advantage of Windows, with pull-down menus, dialog boxes, sizable
windows, and the ease of use you expect in a Windows package. Just point and click; SYSTATE
OuickStat'* buttons give you simple, single-click shortcuts to common statistical analyses.
SYSTAT Ouput can be viewed on-screen, edited, cut, copied, and pasted to other Windows programs.
SYSTAT'S new comprehensive on-line help system includes explanations of SYSTAT commands,
functions, and procedures. You can even access information on a particular topic by searching on a
Key word.
Since Windows allows you to open several windows on the desktop at the same time, you'll be able to
view data and graphics side-by-side. Also, data and graphics are fully integrated in SYSTAT for
Windows: you'll be able to click on data points and instantly view the cases in your data set that
correspond to those points.
SYSTATs interactive graphics let you do more than just calculate statistics. You can explore your
data in new ways and from a variety of perspectives. For example, you can use the lasso tool to
select a subset of data and exclude outlying points, and with just a few clicks create a gaph of the
subset. Or, totate plots to view data from different perspectives, tevealing new insights about
distributions and factors. SYSTAT's analysis is equally interactive. For example, you can substitute
one variable in an analysis or graph with another to explore data in new ways. To compare tesults,
simply display graphic differences.

January 13, 1993. It was a pleasure talking to you about the many advantages of
MCP Long Distance Service.
Based on our conversation, I have enclosed some information that might be of interest
to you. You will find that the services outlined provide the simplicity, convenience
and value you are looking for in a long distance company.
I will be contacting you in the near future to answer any questions you may have.
In the meantime, please do not hesitate to call me at 1-800-373.9777. I look forward
to speaking with you again.

I recently read your article published in INFORM, and was very interested in your studies.
I belong, as project manager, to a Department of EDF (French Electricity Board) Research
Center, which has in charge documentation problems for our company.
I have been myself dealing with document analysis and recognition for several years, and
we have developed a document recognition prototype on a SUN workstation. This prototype
is based on our own binarization and segmentation modules, and uses several OCR toolkits
of the market, particularly those of XIS and CAERE.
The job we have to do this year is the evaluation and qualification of our prototype and
OCR results. So, I would be very interested to read your reports, quoted at the end of your
paper.
Could I also have your e-mail addresses, and the address of ExperVision Inc., that I didn't
know till now ?
Thanks for your answer. Best regards.

Ifyou have any questions after reviewing your January statement, please contact

Lastly, I would briefly like to make you aware of Dick' s
Sporting Goods pricing structure! Dick' s Clothing & Sporting
Goods has been in the sporting goods business for over 45
years. It has been our policy throughout all of these years
to be the lowe st price in town, neve r to be undersold. In
do ing research for this survey, I have found that at various
times our prices are higher than and also less than Syracuse
Sports prices. It is our policy to competitively match or
be at a compe titor' s price on any item, in any of our markets.
Our store managers have the freedom to competitive ly
match any and all prices, thus attempting to achieve the
lowest price in town. Ken, if there is any way that this can
be conveyed to the group membe rss I would appreciate it.
I look forward to meeting you.

As many of you know, I just got a job with Dell Computers. My job is in technical support
which operates on a 7 day a week, 24 hour phone coverage. I have discussed with our
President Jennifer Lopes my current work schedule at Dell. I have to work Saturday
through Wednesday 12:00 to 9:00 PM. This obviously conflicts with my Monday Board
and Membership meetings. Jennifer and I concur that at the current moment in time it
would be best that I drop my position as Public Relations Director so that another member
of the Austin Jaycees can be recruited to take over those important duties.
I still am very much involved with the Jaycees, and while the current work schedule at
Dell might not allow me to appropriately participate in my responsibilities as Director, I
will be available to help any of you in your projects whenever possible.

It was a pleasure meeting you during your visit to PruCare of
Austin on November 2, 1989. I appreciate the time you took
from your busy schedule to discuss managed health care
philosophy and operations with Mo Keathley and me.
Since our meeting I have been reviewing our organizational
needs as a part of our 1990 final planning process.
Unfortunately, I 'm sorry to report that we currently do not
have, or do I foresee in the short term, a position available
for you. I appreciate your consideration of The Prudential and
will certainly keep you in mind for any positions that open up
in the next few months.
I 'm confident that you will be able to find based on your past
success and experience a challenging, rewarding position
somewhere in the health care industry. Best wishes for
continued success and happiness.

Peg suggested I write this letter to propose a new marketing arm for the WIN
product.
I have enjoyed working with Peg to close the Texas Builders Insurance account in
Austin. As we were selling the account together the idea came to us to start a
marketing office to specialize in selling WIN. WIN requires technical expertise
different from group health sales. Because of the differences, it can be difficult for
group health sales agents to sell a Comp product. A Comp specialist, such as Peg,
must be brought in each time.
My proposal is to have WIN contract with me to start a WIN marketing office which
would sell WIN directly to clients, as well as work with Don's sales team as
specialists in the WIN product. Target markets for WIN could include employers,
TPAs and insurance carriers. I have experience with each of these, having spent
eleven years in the managed care field. My resume is attached.
I have arranged a tentative appointment through your secretary to meet you in
Houston on Tuesday, May 4th at 10:00 am. I also hope to meet with Bea Hughes
that day and see your operation first hand. I will call your office Monday to confirm.
Sincerely,

Thank you for your interest in Coopers & Lybrand. l enjoyed meeting with you and we
are very interested in continuing discussions with you about an internship with our

We would like to extend you an offer to visit our Dallas office. You will have the
opportunity to meet with a number of our professional staff and learn more about the
two groups we discussed. We would like to have you meet with our professionals in
our Human Resources Advisory Group - Healthcare Beefits Consulting - and our
Healthcare Consulting Group. The first group generally provides services to employers
and the second group provides services to providers. Lately, they have been teaming
on joint projects.
Please call Cristen Colangelo, our Recruiting Coordinator, at (214) 754-5245 as soon
as possible to arrange a mutually convenient time for your visit.
Should you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call me at (214) 754-5166 or

It is with great pleasure that I share with you new plans for this summer. We are
finally able to begin two individual ministries for our students. Beginning this June, we
will have for the first time a complete Junior High Ministry and a complete High School
Ministry at our Church!
This is exciting for many reasons. First, it allows us to minister more effectively to
all the students God continues to bring our way. During any month of the year, we will
have around 132 students come to our Student Bible Studies (Sunday Schools) and it is has
become difficult to minister to each of them properly with simply one student ministry.
Second, while the creation of two ministries will allow us to minister better, it will also
allow us to continue growing. We never want our students to stop inviting their friends to
West Oakey because it is 'too crowded'' or ''there is not enough room.'' Finally, this will
allow for more Christian adult volunteers to be involved in the lives our students, a
tremendous benefit for all.
What changes will this bring for our current students at West Oakey Baptist
Church? Chris Chandler will be our Junior High Intern for this summer. Chris is one of
our former students who is now a sophmore at Grand Canyon University. Plus, more
events will be targeted for Junior Highers and High Schoolers respectively. For instance,
''NITRO'' will be a monthly event solely for Junior Highers and their friends, and 'Student
Revolution'' will be a monthly event for High Schoolers and their friends only. The other
change you will notice will be with our regularly scheduled events. Student Bible Studies
(Sunday Schools) and Snack Shack will meet as large groups to start, but then Junior
High and High School will be taught separately.
I hope you are already beginning to see how much these two ministries are going to
benefit your student. I also know that this short letter will not answer all the questions you
may have about this subject, so please feel free to call me anytime.
Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to serve you and your family at West
Oakey, and I look forward to seeing what God is going to do among our students this
Summer.
Jn Christ,

As the enclosed letter goes to print, we are very concerned about those of you who live in the
drought- and flood-stricken areas of the United States. Each day the news media bring shocking
reports of the incredible devastation and hardship those of you in these regions are enduring.
If you live in the southern or eastern parts of the country that have been hit by the recent heat wave
and drought, or in the Midwestern areas ravaged by unprecedented flooding, please know that we are
praying for you! Though we can only imagine what you are going through, we want you to know
that we care about each of you, our brothers and sisters in Christ. I have recorded a message to be
heard on radio stations across the nation, asking for contributions and assistance to be directed
through relief organizations, such as World Vision in California. Should we be able to be of
additional help, please call on us.
Enclosed is a copy of my monthly letter on another topic. When you get to the end, you will note a
one-line request for financial support. Be assured that this solicitation is not directed at those of you
who are suffering. The last thing in the world I want is to offend individuals in the midst of such
devastation.
All of us here at Focus on the Family extend our love and concern to you.

If you're like most people today, securing a comfortable future is one of your most important financial
priorities, whether your retirement is right around the corner or several years away. In either case, you
probably have questions about your TIAA-CREF retirement income: What income payment options are
available? What's the best option for me'? What kinds of choices are other participants making? Or, where
can I go for help in making my decision'?
At TIAA-CREF, we realize how important it is that you get the answers to every one of your questions -
and understand all of the income options available - so that you can plan for a retirement that's best suited
to your personal needs and lifestyle. Having a clear understanding of everything TIAA-CREF has to
offer - and the choices you'll eventually be making - is essential to reaching the informed decision that's
right for you.
Our newest booklet, enclosed here, is called Something for Everyone, and it's designed to help you start
getting the answers you need. As the title suggests, the booklet describes the wide array of options and
choices that TIAA-CREF offers, and we're confident that you'll find one that's suited to your needs. In
addition, the booklet also features profiles of a selection of our annuitants, explaining their reasons for
making the choices they did and how our retirement counseling staff was able to help them through the
decision-making process.
If you're interested in learning more about how TIAA-CREF income options can fit into your personal
plans for retirement, simply complete the enclosed reply card and we'll send you more information. If
you'd like to have one of our retirement counselors call you to help determine the choice that's best for
you - or discuss any other issues related to your TIAA-CREF retirement plan - indicate that on the reply
card or give us a call at 1 800 842-2776.
Working together, we are confident we can help you build the kind of rewarding retirement you want and
deserve.

As a special service to our Discover Cardmembers, we asked the Allstate
Life Insurance Company to help solve a problem shared by a great number of
families today - perhaps even yours.
The problem is simply this. Most of us are expected, sometimes gUIIS9.
to carry adequate insurance on things we own, such as our homes, cars and
other possessions. But very few of us carry enough insurance for our most
valuable asset of all - or g - and that's what our families depend on the
mostl
You probably already carry a certain amount of life insurance. But if you're
like most people, once you have some, it's very easy to put it out of your mind
and not see the possibility of needing more. Even with the cost of living rising
rmoderately, if the value of your present insurance remains fixed, you may no
longer have the protection that you originally intended.
You may already recognize that not having enough life insurance could be
somewhat dangerous - especially when you consider the number of changes
that take place in your life that can g2ag the need for more insurance
protection. For example, a young, growing family usually means growing
financial responsibilities. A new home, or larger income, usually requires
additional protection. Perhaps yours is a two-income family, and you DgI) need
adequate life insurance. Or you might be raising a family alone, in which case
insurance protection is ggUDlY important.
Perhaps you dg see the need for more insurance protection, but have
wondered how you can fit it within your budget.
We understand that concern. So, when we set out to help solve the
problem, our objective was to have Allstate develop an insurance plan that offers
you and other eligible Discover Cardmembers protection, flexibility, and
affordability.
First of all, we wanted to provide an insurance plan that would give you
solid protection at aff rdable rate.
We also thought you should be offered a h i f n fi m n
($25,000, $50,000 or $100,000) to best suit your own particular needs. Plus, it
seemed important that the amount of coverage should 5gI decrease over the
years, as you often find with some other life insurance plans.
(over, please)
This insurance plan, developed by Allstate and approved by us for your
consideration, does exactly what we had hoped. It's an excellent term life
insurance plan for Discover Cardmembers which we believe will be valuable to
you now and for many years to come.
Right now, l ask you to carefully read the enclosed material which outlines
the details of conversion and termination provisions, rates, and important
features of this group insurance plan. Notice that it includes an accidental death
benefit that pays IlDg the benefit you select under certain conditions (described
in the lmportant Provisions), reduced r t for non- m kers, and separate
S OUS OV r e,
And it's convenient to enroll. There is no need to send any money. Upon
approval of your Enrollment by Allstate, the monthly charges for your insurance
coverage will be billed to your Discover Card Account. This convenient payment
method lets you avoid writing an extra check each month.
There's also no need to have a physical exam to enroll - answer the few
health questions on the Enrollment Form as you fill it out. Then mail the
completed Enrollment Form in the postage paid envelope provided for your
COnvenience.
A big benefit of enrolling in this Discover Card Term Life Insurance Plan is
the careful attention and prompt, courteous answers you'll receive from trained
and knowledgeable Allstate Customer Service Representatives, should you have
any questions about this plan now - or any time. Allstate is committed to
providing 'extraordinary customer service'' for our Discover Cardmembers. You'll
have someone to talk to and someone who wants to help - because they know you
deserve no less! They are ready for your call and will provide information about the
benefits, rates, claims or service that you may need.
You can contact an Allstate Customer Service Representative about this
Discover Card Term Life lnsurance Plan at their toll-fre number 1-800-669-4104,
Monday through Friday, from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Central Standard Time.
On behalf of Discover Card, I'm especially proud to bring this important
opportunity to your attention today, and sincerely hope you will use it to help protect
the tremendous value you are to your family.
Thank you very much,

Im pleased to invite you to participate in our new Mathcad Preferred Engineer/Scientist Discount Program during the initial
sign-up period, which ends on June 30, 1993.
The purpose of the program is simple: to introduce our newest and most exciting technical calculation tools as they're completed to
a small, select group of people who will make the best use of them. Most engineers and scientists have heard of Mathcad, but only a
fraction have actually used the software, something we expect the Preferred Program to change quickly.
Your partiipation in the Mathcad Preferred Engineer/Scientist Discount Program starts with a full working copy of our new, faster,
fully 32-bit version of Mathcad 4.0, the world's most popular math software, for only $79.99. Yes, it's the same full-feature Mathcad
that sells in etail stores for $495.
Thats a saving of $415 off the list price. 7f course. your Discount Program purchase is fully guaranteed for 60 days.
If you're not amazed with Mathcad, eturn it for a full efund (less shipping and handling).
A remarkable savings, but more so when I give you a feel for what Mathcad 4.0 is and does.
The 'Smart' Math Scratehpad
New Mathcad 4.0 iterally turns your computerrs screen into a 'smart' math scratchpad and is available for Microsoft' Windows%.
(Ifyou prefer, you can order Macintosh Mathcad 3.1 and PC D0S Mathcad 2.5 which have minor differences. The PC D0S version
does not perform symbolic calculations. UNID versions are also available once you're a Preferred Program partidipant.) Responding
to your mouse or keyboard, the program writes and solves virtually any mathematical equation, and communicates the answer to
others without any rewriting. Here's how easy it is:
When you've filled in the blanks, ype an '-'sign, 7sing one of the features based on the
new SmartMath''' rules processor. Mathcad simplifies your equations and solves them accurately with
its powerful Maple symbolic engine whenever possible.
New Mathcad 4.0 gies you the core of Maple, today's most powerful symbolic math tool from the University of Waterloo, Canada.
With just a menu click, for example, Mathcad can simplify a formula or solve for a variable. There is no need to learn a programming
language, just point and click. The symbolic answer is eady for numerical calculations or further symbolic ttansformation.
AMore Useful BenefittoYon fhan Een Time Savings
Of course, using your PC to do all the routine work will save you a considerable amount of time. But new Mathcad 4.0 will do far
more than that. It will allow you to solve problems much more effectively and efficiently.
Because math with Mathcad is so much easier, you'll do more of it as part of each problem you solve. Your answers will be more
accurate. And you'll do more 'what if' calculating than you bother with now.

Accidental accent ... Men's rights ... Playing it safe ... The bores of summer
Handy Men Although
breast tumors are equally
likely to occur on either side
of the body, left-breast tumors
are detected earlier, accord-
ing to Minneapolis surgeon
Leonard Schultz. That's be-
cause the tumors are picked
up by the women's husbands,
Dr. Schultz told Plysiddans
IWeekly, ''and most men are
right-handed.''
Bored to Tears
was out of line in using his position to advance
his personal beliefs. Additionally, they are con-
cerned that this may prove a pivotal moment in
the relationship between sportsmen and fish and
game departments-it appears that Gibbons
would like to see government bureaucrats make
some of the ethical decisions that have tradition-
ally been left up to individual hunters.
Even though many hunters choose not to pur-
sue bear with the aid of hounds, they support the
rights of those who do. Others feel like Gibbons,
that the practice is not sporting, so they don't do
it. Hunting is an activity dominated by ethical
considerations, including the decision to hunt in
the first place. And much of the individual satis-
faction of the sport comes from the knowledge
that a hunt was conducted in a safe, ethical man-
ner and in conjunction with sound wildlife
management principles. Gibbons's recom-
mendations would remove this part of the hunt-
ing experience. Some might think this is a good
idea. Others, clearly, do not.
For now, the issue remains unresolved. Let-
ters and phone calls have poured into California
Governor Pete Wilson's office calling for
Gibbons's resignation. The commission will hear
additional public testimony on the issue at its
August b meeting and should vote on the matter
then,-E.K.
officials have stated that 'active man-
agement' as well as tegulated hunting
are vital elements of the conservation
plan for the Eastern Mojave Desert.
Envitonmental and animal rights ex-
tremists want to set a precedent by clos-
ing off this expanse of land to many ac-
tivities. The LaRocco amendment sends
the message that the American people
want their public land managed for a
wide variety of uses to benefit all the
people, not just a narrow gtoup of ex-
temists. Alowing hunting on 20% of fhe
Desert Protection Act land-where it has
been allowed for generations-is a fair
and teasonable position.
lLA encourages all NRA members to
contact theit Senators and Representa-
tive and urge them to support the LaR-
occo Amendment. Without this vital
change, please uge your lawmakers to
vote against the Calilornia Desert Pro-
tection Act.
Rep. LaRocco deserves the thanks-
and support of hunters and NRA mem-
bers nationwide for standing up to the
envitonmental and animal rights extrem-
ists and for his commitment to our hunt-
ing heritage.
This effort to protect hunting in the
California desert and strong support for
the Hunter Protection Act (S.187 and
H.R.1815) sponsored by the Congres-
sional Sportsmen's Caucus are vital ele-
ments of the lLA federal egislative strat-
egy for the current Congress.
NRA's Hat Is Off To
Madison Ban Beaters
ltoeu, e Madson-aea otens
s lAgainst Crime, a group of con-
cerned tesidents of that Wisconsin city,
narrowly deleated a handgun ban refer-
endum that early polls had shown pass-
ing by a landslide.
Victory against these formidable
odds would not have been possible but
for the hard work of dedicated gun own-
ers and citizens concerned about theit
civil ights. Three companies played par-
ticularly significant toles, both fnancially
and with volunteers, in helping to defeat
the gun ban teferendum.
Gander Mountain, one of the nation's
leading merchandisers of hunting, fish-
ing and camping equipment, led the
way. The company distributes over 30
million catalogs per year and has five re-
tail locations in Wisconsin.
Dave Reitden, Gander Mountain
president, and Kevin McKown, a man-
aget of Gander's Madison store, coordi-
nated the firm's support efforts. Gander
Mountain wrote to 25,000 catalog
customers in Madison asking them to
oppose the ban, donated valuable news-
papet space, and completed over
16,000 'get out fhe vote' phone calls on
voting day. The phone calls were made
by more than 100 store and corporate
employees who volunteered their fime.
Tery Kohler, an NRA Life Member, s
chaitman of the board of North Sails
Group, Inc., a firm famous worldwide as
a producer of sails for racing and cruis-
ing sailboats. His financial backing
played a major ole in defeating the anti-
gunners. Political activism is in Terry
Kohler's veins-his father and grandfa-
ther were governors of Wisconsin.
John Lunenschloss, president of Air-
lLec Industties, gave his company's
stong financial support to the effort. Air-
Lec lndustries was founded in Madison
in 1921, and provides automatic swing-
ing doors for the food preparation and
cold storage industy. Lunenschloss-
''Moose' as friends call him-is an NRA
Benefactor Member, and all his grand-
children are Life Members.
NRA members are urged to support
those industries and companies that
support the rights of gun owners. f you

companies that helped carry the day in

Former NRA Staffer
Col. 'Tod' Sloan Dies
P16L E.F. Tod' Sioan, USA (Ret).of
Redwood City, California, who
served the NRA in various capacities for
more than 35 years, died May 29. He
was 92. His wife Gwendolin survives.
A natve of Chehalis, Washington,
and a gtaduate of the University of Ore-
gon, Col. Sloan joined the National
Guard in 1918 and after graduation ftom
college entered the Army in 1923. While
in the service, he was an active rifle and
pistol competitive shooter, a Distin-
guished Rifleman and the National High-
power Rifle champion in 1931.
Col. Sloan began a second career
with NRA as a summer employee in
1938, became a field tepresentative in
1940, and then departed for U.S. Army
Air Force serice in Workd War ll in 1942,
ultimately attaining the grade of colonel.
Returning fom World War ll service,
Col. Sloan served on the NRA Board of
Directors and was Ditector of Civilian
Marksmanship for two years. Col. Sloan
was delegated by the NRA in 1947 to
help manage and tevitalize the National
Skeet Shooting Ass'n during a dificult
period for that organization.
Returning to NRA service as the
Western States field representative in
1952, Col. Sloan was involved in innu-
merable shooting ttaining programs and
as NRA's tepresentative to kindred orga-
nizations before his retitement in 1977.

founded, and more than fulfills that
pledge of ''continued excellence.''
Though it would be tedious and
impractical to list every new program
and every one of our accomplishments
since 1981, it is imperative that a few
be mentioned:
o The American Legion Family
Support Network, a network of Legion
volunteers connected by sophisticated
communications technology, was cre-
ated during Desert Storm and, so far,
has helped more than 30,000 families
of active duty service people during
times of crisis;
o The National Emergency Fund
raised nearly $1 million and donated
more than $330,000 to help Legion-
naire victims of natural disaster, such
as Hurricane Hugo;
The Temporary Financial Assis-
tance program is currently making
grants totaling more than $300.000 a
year to the children of needy veterans
who need food, clothing, shelter and
medical care;
o The Child Welfare Foundation, to
which you donated more than $1 mil-
lion, awarded $243,000 in 1992 to 10
nonprofit organizations dedicated to
promoting the wholesome develop-
ment of America's youth;
American Legion Baseball fields
718 more teams today than it did a
decade ago, giving 15.000 more
youngsters an opportunity to learn
about sportsmanship and team work.
While some of these programs
were financed largely by contributions
you earmarked for that purpose, many
of the direct and indirect costs of
administering them were paid for with
dues dollars.
The list could continue with details
about the Junior Shooting Sports Pro-
gram, our support for national memo-
rials, job fairs for active duty person-
nel, college loan programs, and
scholarships for numerous athletic and
academic endeavors. But much of the
Legion's work takes place on Capitol
Hill, where veterans find a strong
voice in support of their interests.
For instance, during the past dec-
ade, the Legion:
o Was the only veterans' organiza-
tion to present a comprehensive plan
to preserve the VA medical system
and integrate it into any approved sys-
tem of national health care. This plan
(''An American Legion Proposal To
Improve Veterans Health Care'' --
see June 1993 issue of THE AMERI-
CAN LEGION magazine) was presented
to Mrs. Clinton's Health Care Task
Force in April.
Supported the passage of the
Montgomery GI Bill, subsequent
increases in benefits, and is now
actively lobbying for the adoption of a
Persian Gulf GI Bill;
o Played a key role in documenting
the need for medical assistance for
those suffering from illnesses unique
to the Gulf War;
Conducted the Columbia Univer-
sitylAmerican Legion study of Viet-
nam veterans which paved the way for
allowing many service-connected ben-
efits related to Agent Orange exposure
and PTSD:
o Has been vocal and insistent in its
support for transition benefits for
active and reserve components sepa-
rated due to military downsizing;
Stood firmly in its opposition to
allowing openly homosexual men and
women to serve in the Armed Forces;
o Continues to lobby for the pas-
sage of a constitutional amendment to
protect the U.S. Flag from desecration,
and has played a key role in the enact-
ment of 33 state resolutions calling for
congressional action;
o Provided strong and vocal support
for the resolution of the POW/MIA
issue, and staunch opposition to the
normalization of relations with Viet-
nam until every POW is accounted for
and repatriated;
+ Supported the Contras and the
development of democracy in the
Caribbean Basin;
Developed documentation about
the aging veteran health-care crisis
and provided strong legislative sup-
port on their behalf;
Helped create the Job Training
Partnership Act and the Disabled Vet-
erans Outreach Program;
Helped create Vet Centers and
acquire VA treatment for PTSD and
certain ailments associated with expo-
sure to Agent Orange;
o Was instrumental in creating the
Veterans Readjustment Appointment
Authority and the U.S Court of Veter-
ans Appeals;
Lead the way for the creation of
the Department of Veterans Affairs;
Helped create the position of
Assistant Secretary of Veterans Em-
ployment and Training in the Depart-
ment,of Labor;
Established a job training and
placement program for veterans in
with 26V5'' barrels bored weak modified
and full, With this I've done far better
than a bird in hand for every two shells
a number of times.
My Browning weighs 6Vi lbs., car-
ries nicely and fits me like no other. It
loves the Federal 2V2-dr, equiv. 1-oz.
field load with No, 7V shot.
I now use this load for most quail
shooting regardless of species. This load
puts about 50% and 65% of the shot in a
30'' circle at 40 yds, from the weak
modified and full barrels, respectively.
Patterns are extremely even and serve
me well between 25 and 35 yds, where
most western quail shooting takes place.
In brush, I switch over to the Winches-
ter game loads with A oz. of No. 8 shot,
which open up quickly for shooting
under 25 yds,
When the wind blows hard and the
birds are really wild, my shooting falls
apart with the little 20-ga. I've had sim-
ilar experiences with light 12-ga, over-
unders. For me, the lack of forward
weight and the increased wind resis-
tance of two vertically arranged barrels
makes light, short-barreled over-unders

play some impressively
that further expand the scope of
outpatient services. But the cur-
rent debate on national health
care also raises a red flag, Aster
admits, especially since more
than two-thirds of Vivra's dia-
lysis revenues are paid by Medi-
care - and Medicare's reim-
bursements already are lower
than they were 10 years ago.
There's talk in Washington of
increasing dialysis payments by
2.5% a year, he adds, but
whether the increase will actu-
ally go through remains any-
one's guess.
On the other hand, Aster
avers, reduced payments would
drive out more marginal opera-
tors, giving Vivra even more

the other zags. Global bonds and
domestic junk are good comple-
ments precisely because they're
usually out of sync. When the
U.S. economy is weak, foreign
bonds produce strong returns
because the dollar and rates are
falling while economically sensi-
tive junk lags. Conversely, junk
is strong during expansions
while foreign bonds lag because
of a rising greenback and climb-
ing interest rates.
Merriman demonstrates by
combining two highly regarded
funds in each category, the T.
Rowe Price International Bond
Fund with the Federated High
Yield Bond Fund, for the last
four and a half years. That
period includes a recession, the
junk-bond market meltdown
and wide swings in the dollar.
For the span, the Price Interna-

of 9.5% annually while the Fed-

annually, Merriman calculates

ent shop into a jack-of-all-trades for the
multimedia age. From the sleek, $16 mil-
lion headquarters that I. M. Pei designed
for him in Beverly Hills, Ovitz offers
his clients advice on everything from
advertising and investment banking to
sports marketing and technology. CAA's
100-odd agents run the gamut from Ar-
mani-wearing types to gray-suited num-
ber-crunchers (page 54).
PR HAMb. Make no mistake: Ovitz still
derives his clout from the big names in
his Filofax. Michael Jackson, Steven
Spielberg, Kevin Costner, and so on,
Just look at this summer's big movies:
CAA packaged combinations of stars, di-
rectors, and writers for Jurassic Park
and Cliffhanger. It represented many of
the stars in Dave, Sleepless in Seattle,
and Dennis the Menace. And Ovitz res-
cued The Firm, a project that had all
but fallen apart last year when CAA
client Tom Cruise balked at the directors
Paramount had proposed for the film.
Along came Ovitz, with client Sydney
Pollack in tow. With Pollack at the helm,
TAe Fiyn has generated $115 million in
ticket sales so far.
What sets Ovitz apart, though, is his
dogged push to insinuate himself and
CAA into realms far beyond mere movie-
making. The MGM deal solidifies his sta-
tus as Hollywood's foremost investment
banker. He already advised Sony on its
$8.4 billion purchase of Columbia Pie-
tures and brokered Matsushita's nearly
$7 billion acquisition of MCA.
Ovitz can be a powerful force behind
the scenes, too. This spring, he offered
shopping tips to Edgar Bronfman Jr., a
longtime friend and president of Joseph
E. Seagram Corp., who was looking to
invest in a media company. In June,
Bronfman plunked down more than $700
million for a 5.7% stake in Time Warner
Inc. Ovitz is also advising Paramount
Communications Corp. on possible deals,
including a joint venture with British
recording giant Thorn EMI PLC that
didn't get off the ground: 'He's an op-
portunist,' says Paramount Chairman
Martin S. Davis, 'and I mean that in
the finest sense of the word.''
Last year, Ovitz spirited the creative
portion of Coca-Cola Co.'s huge advertis-
ing account away from McCann-Erick-
son Worldwide, the soft-drink giant's
longtime agency. Now, he is trying to
help Nike Inc. break into sports-event
promotion by producing a Super Bowl
for college foothall, with six playoff
games, TV specials, and a worldwide sat-
ellite broadcast. As with everything,
Ovitz views the deal in multimedia
terms: ''Entertainment and sports will
be the Trojan horse that brings every-
thing else into the home,' he says.
To close the loop on digital media,
Ovitz is also forging ties with technology
companies that produce multimedia hard-
ware and software. In recent months,
Ovitz has cultivated such high-tech
heavyweights as Microsoft Chairman
William H. Gates III, Apple Computer
Chairman John Sculley, and Robert M.
Kavner, technology czar at ATST.
Ovitz and Gates are nearing an agree-
ment to co-develop interactive TV com-
that Ovitz is tending more to Gates or
Seulley than Cruise could prove damag-
ing. As Paramount President Stanley R.
Jaffe, a longtime Ovitz champion, points
out: 'In a creative business, when some-
one doesn't get a call back in the 30
minutes he's allotted you, he may start
to look elsewhere'' Indeed, ICM's Berg
crows that five CAA clients, including
actor James Woods, have left Ovitz'
agency in recent weeks.
Woods may be no Madonna or Spiel-
berg. But Ovitz can't shrug off any client
defections, since he owns little but his
relationships. What's more, industry ex-
perts say overall revenue in the talent-
agent business has dropped 20% since
1991 as Hollywood battles its costs. For
his part, Ovitz insists CAA's revenues
are up. Rivals estimate the agency rakes
in $200 million a year; Ovitz' 55% stake
could net him an estimated $10 million.
Still, CAA draws its power from an
ephemeral network of clients and po-

develops software products that address some of
the very problems presented in the article.
Originally, computers were supposed to slay the
paper dragons that surround us in business. How-
ever, they did just the opposite, since they made it
easier to create, edit, and print documents. Now,

months, when Father knew that the

painful part for David was selling
the calf.
When the letter arrived telling
Mother that Pa was giving up and

She, too, loved farming and had
shared my father's dreams. Now
what would become of them?

Dave, who had been a poor stu-

and, after being mustered out, grav-
itated toTesas, where he worked on
a cattle ranch.
Iwas born during that war, but it
was years later that Dave again re-
turned home and I met my 'true'
brother, whose heroic existenceIhad
shared in my dreams. I regarded
him as my 'true' brother because of
my identification with his exciting
life and because my other brother,
Harry, was so much older, lived
apart from us with his own family
(including a son whom I detested),
and he simply did not seem like a
brother. How wonderful itmust be,I
thought, to have a brother to play
with. AllIhad were sisters, and they
were no fun at all.

(Continued from page 79) kowski of the
Association of Flight Attendants, which
represents cabin-crew workers at twenty-
one U.S. airlines. Small mock-ups, he says,
lack realism.
Flight attendants, pilots, and the Safety
Board say that attendants are often con-
fused because they work on several differ-
ent types of aircraft. Emergency proce-
dures and the location of equipment can
vary on each. There can even be variations
on the same type. And the manuals that
trainees study can be thick, dense, and dif-
ficult to follow. Pollard sees no reason for
confusion. ''I can get on an aircraft and
find the equipment,'' she says.''How many
places are there to put it?''
[N BRITAIN, FLIGHT ATTENDANTS
iare allowed to fly on only three types of
aircraft. The FAA has no such rule in the
United States. Delta Airlines trains its
flight attendants on all eight aircraft types
now in its fleet; other major U.S. airlines
train their cabin crew on five or more.
''It's very difficult for flight attendants
to be proficient on more than three types
of aircraft, because you could confuse
yourself in an emergency,'' says Gordon
Bennett, chairman of Cabin Crew 89, a
union representing British Airways flight
attendants. ''When you have only seconds
to act and you're worrying about how to
open an exit door, the fewer aircraft you're
licensed on, the better. It's crazy to be cer-
tified on more than three types.''
Unlike their American counterparts,
British flight attendants must meet before
every flight to discuss safety issues. The se-
nior attendant on each British flight must
brief other attendants and test knowledge
of emergency procedures before takeoff.
In Germany and Sweden, flight atten-
dants must be certified by the federal gov-
ernment. ''You need a license to cut hair in
Alabama, but no license is required to be a
flight attendant in this country,'' says a
U.S. pilot.
Mike Gordon, of Cabin Crew 89, says
airlines need to improve coordination be-
tween pilots and flight attendants. ''That's
vital,'' Gordon says. ''There's a need to
have attendants training with pilots. I'd
like to see them together for at least half a
day during initial training and a few hours
during recurrent.''
The Safety Board agrees in principle. In
one of the thirteen recommendations put
to the FAA, the board also called for train-
ing designed to improve coordination and
communication between cabin and cock-
pit crews, ''Some airlines do joint
pilot-flight attendant training, but we
want all airlines to do it, and do more of
it,'' says Nora Marshall, a senior accident
investigator at the Safety Board. ''We
want group exercises during evacuation
and ditching [over water] training.''
The FAA says it has advised airlines
about the importance of such coordina-
tion, but it will not put out a regulation or
force airlines to conduct group evacua-
tion and ditching drills during recurrent
training. ''We're giving this issue a lot of
priority, but we'd like to see changes
through other means than regulations,''
says Pollard. New regulations, she adds,
can be costly to the airlines, the govern-
ment, and the traveling public, and the
FAA is required by federal law to consid-
er cost factors before implementing a new
safety rule.
The FAA also disagrees with several
other Safety Board recommendations. The
agency sees no need for individual instruc-
tors who would evaluate flight attendants
during hands-on exit drills to make sure
that they performed successfully. It also
opposes a recommendation calling for new
guidelines for FAA inspectors on how to
evaluate training programs ''to ensure that
flight attendants retain the skills and
knowledge that are necessary in emergency
situations.'' The FAA says it believes that
the current system of annual recurrent
training is sufficient.
Nonetheless, it yielded to complaints
sufficiently to form an advisory committee
of airline and union officials-a committee
that often finds it difficult to reach con-
sensus. It has recently been trying to deter-
mine what training should be made obli-
gatory. Mary Ellen Miller of the
Independent Federation of Flight Atten-
dants says she is frustrated by the lack of
progress. ''We've been meeting for a cou-
ple of years and, yes, it could virtually go
on forever. You can committee something
to death if that's your intention. IfI were a
pessimist, I'd say that is the intent here.''
Conflict arises over anxiety that crew
performance during emergencies could
also be depreciated by lengthy workdays
(which can exceed sixteen hours on some
international flights). After years of urg-
ing, the federal agency recently proposed
rules that prohibit airlines from scheduling
flight attendants for more than fourteen
hours of duty on domestic and interna-
tional flights. Attendants don't think this
is good enough, because the proposed lim-
its apply only to scheduled hours, whereas
time on the job can be extended by flight
delays.
There is further conflict over emergency
medical training. ''Far more attention is
focused on in-flight meals and passenger
service,'' says Constance Stevens, a safety
expert who flies for a U.S, airline and
treats about one medical emergency each
year. ''We have very minimal first aid
training, and it's not sufficient. So many
children are traveling today, but we are not
familiar with the different ways of treating
infants, children, and the elderly.''
''There's no evidence that flight atten-
dants don't have enough emergency med-
ical training,'' says the FAA's Pollard.
PHE SITE WHERE TRUDY SMITH'S
i ife was changed forever is now a piece
of Everglades marshland supervised
by the South Florida Water Management
District. Two months ago she finally re-
turned here---another step in exorcising
the long memory of her ordeal. ''You go
through a year of thinking you're nuts be-
fore you realize that you may be normal,''
says Smith. ''It took two years to find a
good psychologist, three years to be able to
fly again.''
The nightmares are over now for Smith,
who has marshaled strong positive
thoughts and is happy with the personality
change that overtook her after the crash.
''I came out of the Everglades completely
changed,' she says. ''I was a naive, shy per-
son who would do anything I was told. I
came out of the crash a fighter-I knew I
was going to have to fight for my sanity
and for everything that was mine.
''When you don't save everyone's life,
you start questioning all that you did,''
adds Smith, who found out only three
months after the crash that the coach pas-
senger she prevented from going to the
bathroom lived through the ordeal. ''It's a
matter of putting an end to it and getting
on with your life,''
The return to the Everglades was special
also because it was the first time Smith met
with Jan Murray after counseling her by
phone---one of many survivors she has
counseled in this way or with postcrash-
trauma videotapes. Although the two
worked for different airlines, they, ironi-
cally, were in the same classroom in
1978--eleven years before Murray was in
the Sioux City crash. Smith was a guest
lecturer when the rookie Murray went
through the initial training before her first
flight. ''I was just a small-town girl from
South Carolina who wanted to see the
world,'' says Murray. ''When Trudy spoke
at the training seminar, I realized that she
had been there, had traveled down every
road, and she became my hero. The true
meaning of the job, safety above all,
dawned on me for the first time.''

But the price might be worth the
wait-warehouse stores cut their
profit to the bone. (Warehouse stores
often carry designer labels, too; a
recent visitor to Price Club saw
brands including Liz Claiborne, Polo
by Ralph Lauren, and Evan Picone
alongside cheaper, generic frames.)
Recently, LensCrafters and Pearle
have also started going after the
many folks who want to pay mass-
merchandiser prices. LensCraflers is
opening dozens of optical stores in
K Marts under the name Sight &
Save this year. There it will sell com-
plete glasses at S39 to S99. And
Pearle has installed an ''Eye Buys'
section in some of its stores: Com-
plete glasses sell for S80, cheaper
than many frames alone cost else-
where in the same store.
Gasses to go
Optical superstores with an on-
premises lab can make most glasses
in much less than a day (although
some lens coatings and prescrip-
tions, especially for bifocals, can take
longer). In our survey, readers re-
ported that the fastest chains were
EyelMasters, LensCrafters, and Opti-
World, all of which managed to ill
more than half of their orders in less
than a day, LensCraflers ads promise
to produce glasses within an hour,
and 56 percent of the chain's cus-
tomers in our survey said they re-
ceived their glasses that quickly. In
all, 83 percent said their glasses were
ready by the day's end.
The longest waits were at Price
Club, Frame-n-Lens, For Eyes, Sears,
and Royal Optical, where most cus-
tomers waited at least a week for
their glasses. About one-quarter of
the readers who went to Royal com-
plained that the glasses weren't
ready when promised. The same
number complained that EyelMasters
stores were too slow: Although Eye-
Masters was faster than most other
chains, it was not as fast as readers
said they had been led to expect.
In principle, even stores without an

it, and it's unlikely it would have worked,
anyway. When we called a special investor
hotline set up by the National Association of
Securities Dealers (NASD) to disclose the
backgrounds of brokers, we were told (both
over the phone and in writing) that ''nothing
was pending'' concerning broker ''Jones.''
The SEC case was not mentioned by the
NASD, as it should have been.
This story, however, is neither about one
bad adviser nor any one company. Although
the risk of receiving bad advice always
exists, advisers by and large are honest and
follow a long list of rules set by the industry.
And even the most conscientiously designed
plan can go wrong. This tale concerns the
lack of government oversight of one of the
largest industries in America.
Finding a competent planner who has
your interests in mind is hard enough by
itself. We sent staff members, male and
female, from the CD offices to every differ-
ent type of ''planner''-stockbrokers, inde-
pendent advisers, affiliated planners, insur-
ance agents, accountants, bank counselors
and lawyers-to find out what a person off
the street would be offered in the way of
responsible advice. Too many simply tried
to sell us high-commission products with lit-
tle or no regard for the suitability of the
''plan'' to our stated objectives: often, no
product line-as is the case with many bro-
kerages, insurance agencies and banks-the
narrower the advice was and the quicker and
harder the sales pitch. But such behavior
wasn't inevitable; we found competence and
a conscientious approach displayed by at
least one planner in each category. The help
is out there, even if it's hard to find.
In fact, the issue isn't corrupt or self-
interested planners, even though on an indi-
vidual basis, such people can cause terrible
harm. The problem is that consumers aren't
getting the protection they should from the
governmental agencies and private organi-
2zations that claim to provide it. If the agen-
cies charged with monitoring financial
advice won't protect you, who will?
Why The $ystem Is Ioubied. Finding honest,
objective financial advice has to be one of
the toughest tasks facing today's consumers.
After three years of research, we discovered
an industry in which anyone can hang out a
shingle to handle your life savings and not
be effectively policed by any government
agency. Too many of these advisers will
earn healthy commissions on what they sell,
no matter how it benefits-or hurts-you.
Basically, financial advisers can operate
anywhere there's a desk and a phone. Only
26 states require that investment-adviser
firms-not individuals-even register with
state securities departments. That process
usually involves filling out a form. Of
course, those who sell insurance, securities
and real estate (or are accountants or
lawyers) must have licenses and pass tests.

transplanted hair appears more natural.
From 30 to 350 plugs are transplanted at
each two- to three-hour session. One to four
sessions are usually required, scheduled a
month or more apart. Transplanted hair falls
out in a few weeks and comes in fresh in
about three more months, growing at the
same rate as it did before it was moved-
about half an inch a month. The entire treat-
ment takes from eight to 18 months, which
is one reason it is so pricey (see table).
Transplanted hair is not forever. At best,
it lasts as long as it would have at the origi-
nal site. Any follicles that are inadvertently
compressed during the process may produce
curly hair, where it was previously straight.
The best candidates for transplantation are:
Men with receding hairlines and/or
bald spots at the top of the head. Men with
large areas of baldness may not have enough
donor hair to fill in these areas.
+ White men with gray, blond, red and
light-brown hair. More dark hair is required
because of the contrast with light skin.
Men with curly hair, because it covers
so well and stays in the area in which it is
planted. Wavy hair does not give quite as
good results. Straight hair covers least well.
Men with fine hair. While it doesn't
cover as well as thick hair, fine hair usually
gives a better result because it is more man-
ageable than thick hair strands.
Men with dense hair. Although when
transplanted, it could look tufted and not
natural, smaller-sized grafts may prevent
this problem.
The other surgical technique for trans-
planting hair is the ''flap.'' This is usually
performed by a plastic surgeon while the
patient is in an operating room under gener-
al anesthesia. The surgeon cuts a wide strip
of hair-bearing scalp and, leaving a small
''foot'' attached to maintain its blood and
nerve supply, rotates it to a denuded area
where a like-size strip of bald scalp has been
removed. After fitting it, the surgeon sutures
the flap to hold it in place. The edges of the
wound left behind are also sutured shut.
Once the flap has established its own blood
supply, the small''foot'' is cut away.
Reduding the Bald Spot. Instead of moving
hair into the bald area, the bald area itself
can be reduced. Sometimes called a ''hair-
lift,'' this is done by a plastic surgeon in an
operating room while the patient is under
general anesthesia. An ellipse-shaped piece
of bare scalp about two inches wide and
seven inches long is cut out, and the gaping
edges are brought together and sutured.
After the scalp heals, only a thin line is left.
A series of scalp reductions can be carried
out over a course of many months to keep
reducing the bald area.

cense to have a life of entitlement.
We took trips to Bali and Carnival
in Rio. Sometimes I was embarrassed
beca use Connie, of course, always
paid. She'd say, ''Don't be ridiculous.
I want to go, and I want you to be
with me.'' She handled it all very
matter-of-factly, made me feel great
that she cared so much for me, said I
was worth it. She called me Beauty.
That just about brought me to my
knees.
The decisions were all in her court,
and I was at her disposal in terms of
time, interests, sex. This was never
spoken but was always in the air be-
tween us: ''It's my money, so we'll do
it my way.'' I gave her all power in
the relationship, couldn't even dis-
agree with her. If she'd had no
money, I probably wouldn't have put
up with it.
When I was offered work as a mu-
sician, she made the decision for me,
saying, ''You don't have to take the
job!'' She loved that I was a pianist
but didn't want my music to interfere
with our life together. I couldn't tell
her, but this was eating away at my
confidence. After about two years,
the strain started to show, although
we were still very pleasant to each

had become quite ill, and if he died,
half of his art collection would have
to be sold to cover the taxes on the
other half. He had also asked her to
remarry him, but she said she
wouldn't if it would upset me. In re-
ality, I knew she would anyway.
Our affair had to end sometime,
and here was a graceful way out, so I
urged her to go ahead with the re-
marriage. I even escorted her to the
jewelry store to buy a new diamond
and ruby wedding ring.
I felt pretty low when she left. All
along, I knew exactly what I wanted
from her... but not how attached to
the opulence I'd actually become.
Now I only want more.
The Stud
Jean-CClaude grem up in Rouen,
France, where his wido wed mother
worked in a tailors shop, read fashion
Ntagazines, and fantasized about lead-
ing an affluent life. By his teens, he
realized that he, too, yearned for
glatnnour. So, with a knockoff Versace
suit, a few' changes of underw'ear, and
the eguiralent of $150, Jean-Claude
left for Paris at nineteen to begin his
social ascent.
I'd heard that to meet a rich
woman I should go to the Angelique,
a quiet, refined tea shop behind the
lLouvre. The patrons were elegant
women, some alone, some in pairs.
My first time there, I must've had a
half dozen cups of tea waiting for
something to happen, but nothing
did. When I finally called for the
check, the waiter said it had already
been paid and handed me a lady's
card that smelled of G uerlain and
was printed with her name and ad-
dress-an apartment on the Avenue
Foch.
What a night, that first night! I
had never made love in a four-poster
bed or used what Monique called
lattar d amour, love oil. Her night-ta-
ble drawer was filled with sexual
paraphernalia, very scandalous, so
forbidden. Although I was hardly a
virgin, Monique was unlike any
woman I'd ever been with. She was
demanding and uninhibited, the op-
posite of how she appeared outside
the bedroom. I was lucky to have
found such a kind and patient-and
passionate---patroness to teach me
about la vie amoureuse. And she was
delighted I was well-mannered and
knew how to behave among her mon-
eyed coterie.
Her husband worked too much and
was uninterested in sharing her flashy
social life. Certainly he couldn't make
love for hours, the way I could. She
felt it was important to attend a din-
ner or the ballet with a man on her
arm, and her friends didn't seem to
mind if he was young and handsome.
Appearance was all they cared about
---as long as I looked wonderful and
didn't say the wrong thing. In this
circle, husbands had mistresses, and
wives had young male escorts, les
bons amis, Everyone understood this
was perfectly acceptable, no questions
asked.
The subject of money was handled
discreetly. Clumsy about it at first, I
asked Monique for 1,575 francs to
pay my hotel bill. She seemed
shocked, as if I had belched during
the final pas de deux of Swan Lake.
The next day, the concierge told me
everything was taken care of. Thank-
ing Monique with words would have
been declasse (and vulgar negotia-
tions were equally inappropriate). but
that night l'attar d 'amour came in
particularly handy. This became our
established routine. Monique also be-
gan giving me money to buy tulips
for her bedroom, making it clear I
shouldn't return the change, often a
handsome sum.
I understood that if I transgressed
--misbehaved in public, was seen at a
cafe with a girl--I'd no longer be
welcome at her apartment, since these
actions could make her look foolish.
And when the affair was over, it was
over, without tears or recriminations.
She sent me a beautiful set of cuff
links and a silver-framed photograph
of herself.
After Monique, I spent time with
other women who didn't care if sex
was involved--they simply wanted
company---though I certainly wasn't
expected to be carrying on with any-
one else. With these women, keeping
up appearances was also essential. In
public, I had to look devoted and
passionate; people assumed we were
having wild sex!
By the time I reached twenty-eight.
I'd been through perhaps thirty of
these liaisons and the game was
played out. Fortunately, for years I'd
been quietly investing my earnings,
until I had enough to finance my way
through the Sorbonne. Those dear
women paid for my education. After
I got my law degree, I represented
many of them in their divorces.
The Working Boy
Hhife he was a student at Columbia
Unirersity, Patrick regularly sold him-
self sexually to women, not to finance
his education but to satisfy an intense
urge to rebel against a solid Republi-
can upbringing (he 'd attended the
satne boarding school as had his father
and grandfather). He wanted to lead a
life of total debauchery and, he says,
''went after it heart and soul.''
The first time I had sex for money.
it was through an escort service, one
of the few that handle men for
women. I wore a Brooks Brothers
suit and silk tie, like I was going for
an interview at some investment com-
pany, maybe Bear Stearns. The
woman was in New York on busi-
ness, and I was so excited about get-
ting paid for sex I just pounced on
her. She paid only for an hour, but I
must've made love to her for three or
four. I did everything to her because I
felt I had to put out 110 percent.
Judging by her chain of orgasms, she
had a great time. Afterward, when I
told the girl at the escort service
a bout my erotic marathon, she
laughed and said I shouldn't be so
diligent or I'd wear myself out.
I really like sex, so it was easy to
meet women. Usually, I went for la-
dies in their forties. We'd make eye
contact in a department store or at
the movies -''Hello, how're you do-
ing?'' -and go from there to a bar or
coffee shop, sit around, talk. They
usually didn't know right away they'd
have to pay me. I wanted them to
feel we really hit it off and liked each

WAKEFIELD HAlLlL t---+==
1 found it hard to sleep that night, and
when at last I did, my sleep was laced with
troubling dreams, which, upon awakening,
I struggled to remember. Shortly after
dawn, I realized it was useless to stay in
bed any longer.
Still in my nightgown, I went into the
kitchen to make myself a cup of coffee,
staring at the circle of blue flame beneath
the throbbing kettle. I realized with some
trepidation that I had not yet listened to
the tape of my interview with Lawrence
Brandt. I did so-once, then again.
I walked to the window, gazing at the
austere cityscape as I sipped my coffee.
The telephone rang.
I had expected it to be Jack-it was a
little past eight o'clock-but was surprised
to hear Christina von Shouse's voice in-
stead. ''Hello, my dear,'' she said in a
friendly tone. ''I hope you don't mind my
calling at this hour.''
Not at all, I reassured her, waiting to
hear what could have prompted her call.
''You saw him yesterday, I understand,''
she began. ''Lawrence Brandt. You met
with him yesterday in the country, didn't
you And what did you think? Was my as-
sessment correct?''
I was amazed that she knew about my
appointment with Brandt but merely told
her that he had been extremely articulate
and helpful.
''His wife left him not long ago, you
know'' was her curious non sequitur-in-
tended to unsettke me, no doubt. ''He was
devastated, I hear. But then he should
have expected it, the way he treated her!
Only Joanna knew how to bring out the
best in him. He owes a great deal to her.
And to David. They launched his career,
without question.''
I asked why she felt compelled to tell
me this.
''To be helpful to you,'' she said after a
second's pause. ''I consider myself the only
person who really knew Joanna well. All
aspects of her,''
I have lived in New York long enough
to question such ''kindness'' and told her
that she needn't be concerned: All sides
would be carefully weighed.
''In that case,'' she replied with a weary
laugh, ''you might as well give up!''
I asked her why it seemed impossible.
''Because there are some things about
Joanna that no one will ever know,'' She
paused. ''Except perhaps myself.''
''Things you know but will not tell me?''
I inquired. ''Or things that even you do not
know?''
''Oh, my dear, there is little or nothing I
do not know!'' she retorted in her throaty
voice.
''I see,'' I murmured, wondering pre-
cisely what she had meant. For the mo-
ment, however, I had no intention of let-
ting her know she had piqued my curios-
ity, ''One thing continues to puzzle me,'' I
added as matter-of-factly as I could. ''Only
you seem to know about the last letter that
Joanna supposedly wrote David Cassel-
the letter to be given to him after her
death.''
''No one else knows the truth,'' she re-
plied with icy authority. ''Joanna never hid
anything from me, you see. She confided
in me as she did in no one else,'' Her tone
The night of Christina von Shouse's din-
ner arrived. I had spent an inordinately
long time dressing, and was grateful for
the new red dress that I had reserved to
wear that night: Even now I can recall the
feeling of the silk and the precise, shapely
way it was tucked across the hips and the
ribbons of red satin that edged its full, bil-
lowing sleeves and long skirt.
My hair brushed, my diamond earrings
from Jack in place, I stood nervously be-
fore the mirror for a moment, not entirely
displeased. I fixed my lipstick, checked my
evening bag, and locked the door to my
apartment, taking a taxi to Christina's
apartment, my apprehension as intense as
my curiosity. I was, as I recall, rather late.
The slight, dark-haired maid whom I
remembered from the afternoon in August
took my cap. ''Please find your card,'' she
said with a slight nod, indicating the rows
of tiny white envelopes on a nearby con-
sole, I found one with my name and
opened it. ''Blue porcelain,'' it said: my ta-
ble, I moved to another console, where the
seating arrangement was re-created on a
giltedged leather table plan. I was seated
next to David Cassel, it seemed, which did
not displease me. Tucking the card into my
handbag, I ordered a drink from one of
the roving waiters and walked into the
drawing room.
One glimpse was enough to convince
me this was an ''important'' dinner. An
aura of confidence and self-congratulation
already permeated the atmosphere, the sort
that accompanies those who know they
have accepted the right invitation.
Christina von Shouse approached in a
severe black dress, her neck looped with
lustrous gray pearls. I could almost hear
her mentally assessing my own dress as she
kissed me on both cheeks. ''Chanel?'' she
asked at once. I nodded. ''Ravishing,'' she
said with a glance that seemed almost in-
appropriately resolute.
Placing her hand lightly on the small of
my back, she turned to me with customary
authority and said, ''Come. Let me intro-
duce you to everyone,'' as she led me
deeper into the room.
Most of the names, however, I knew, as
people were introduced to me by turns. I
heard myself talking and laughing, infused
by the hazy warmth of my kir royale;
speaking of politics one moment, of a re-
cently published book at another-fulfill-
ing my obligation as a guest, in short, even
as I took in the room, its Russian decor at
its most splendid, and mused about the re-
lationship of the guests to the hostess.
I continued to wend my way through
the crowd, spotting David Cassel in the
dark green armchair before the fireplace,
looking jaunty and appealing in black tie.
He motioned to me. I made my way to-
ward him.
When David Cassel grasped my hand,
the firmness of his grip and the focus of
his eyes made me recall our first meeting
at Wakefield Hall. ''Come join me, Elisa-
beth,'' he said. I did so, gathering my skirt
about me and saying something cheerful
and noncommittal-I asked him about his
summer, mentioned that I was delighted to
be seated next to him-even though I did
not relish the idea of discussing the pro-
gress of my research that night. Cassel now
appeared to me in such a different light!
He went on to press me about the pro-
''YACHATS COVERED BRIDGE at left is
just one of 50 located in Oregon. Folks are
surprised to learn our state has the most cov-
ered bridges west of the Mississippi River.''
''BRIGHT GREEN FOLIAGE surrounds the
many tributaries that rush into the Santiam
River (shown at lower left), which flows
through the eastern part of Willamette Valley.''
''FLOWER FARMS (right) make the Willa-
rmette Valley a spectacular area to photo-
graph. Poppies and daisies are just two of the
many flowers grown for their seeds here.''
''SWEEPING VIEW below shows the Salmon
River Estuary meeting the Pacific Ocean at
Cascade Head. 1 like to visit this area during
a low tide so the sandy beach is visible.''

For starters, both are married and have two children. Kix
and his wife, Barbara, have a three-year-old son, Eric, and a
five-year-old daughter, Molly. Ronnie has a l2-year-old
daughter, Whitney, and a 10-year-old son, J.W. (Jesse
Wayne), who both live with their mother, his ex-wife, in
Tulsa. Ronnie and his wife, Janine, have no children from
their marriage, but Ronnie adds that he sees his kids from his
first marriage often, sometimes taking them on the road with
him. Kix and Ronnie both reside in Nashville.
One of the hardest things about their lifestyle as entertain-
ers, both also agree, is the time it means away from family.
''Barbara told me yesterday that my three-year-old fell down
and had to get eight stitches in his hand,'' says Kix. ''I wanted
this stuff that's happening to me now. He missed all that.''
Both Kix and Ronnie also share, in their separate back-
grounds, a history of encouragement from certain members
of their respective families that helped inspire each of them
to follow his dream of musical success and stardom.
'BBe a big fish irn a big pordi'
''My dad always encouraged me to be a big fish in a big
pond,'' says Kix. ''I remember when I was getting out of high
school, I was thinking of asking him to cosign a note so I
could buy a bar in Shreveport. I had a great local following
there, and I wanted to be the headliner. He was like, 'Get out
of here. If you're serious about what you're doing, go for the
big time. If you want to be in the music business, then be in
the music business.'''
''My grandmother-my dad's mother-singled me out,''
says Ronnie. ''We were very poor growing up, and she sin-
gled me out from all the other grandkids for some reason.
She always said, 'Don't let life keep you down. You're spe-
cial.' Just to have somebody telling you that is the key. It
doesn't make you grow up thinking you're better than any-
body else, but it did push me through a lot of things in life.
She'd tell me, 'Pull yourself out of the crowd. Go! Go/' ''
Kix and Ronnie also discovered other similarities in their
childhoods. Asked about their favorite boyhood toy, they
both reply, almost in unison: ''A BB gun!''
''A Daisy!'' says Kix, recalling the specifics. ''Winchester
style. I can remember, day after day, taking off by myself
with my BB gun in the woods....''
''Me, too!'' says Ronnie excitedly. ''I'd get home from
school, grab my pellet gun and head for the woods to go blue
jay hunting.''
''Shoot all the sparrows you want,'' says Kix, repeating an
instruction he no doubt heard often, ''but no cardinals.''
''Blue jays,'' continues Ronnie. ''We could nail the blue
jays. They were bad. But I remember the first time I shot a
all, oatmeal cook-off, trail ride,
parade and games for children.

Getting started on
your dream kitchen
Designing your own kitchen can be an
exciting exercise in self-discovery. Get out
your pencil and paper and start planning.
T. List your dreams. Write down
everything about every kitchen idea you've
ever liked. Include magazine clippings, color
swatches and other bits of inspiration.
2. List your needs. Take inventory of your
lifestyle. Do you have enough cabinet space?
Is your refrigerator too crowded? Do you
spend a lot of time cleaning upf Is your
kitchen too dark?
3, Choose a floor plan that's right for
you: L-shaped: Forms a natural triangle.

The next step
Once you've established your priorities, take
your lists to a contractor, architect or kitchen
and bath designer. And don't forget to stop
by your local Frigidaire dealer. Regardless of
who designs or remodels your kitchen, you
will have to select the appliances, and that's
where Frigidaire makes your task easy.
You'll be amazed at how these appliances
fulfill all your kitchen dreams and needs.
What is UltraStyle design?
People don't have sharp corners; appliances
shouldn't either. Eliminating the edges,
corners and creases also eliminates traps for
dirt and grease. The rounded edges blend in
better with all decors. These smooth edges
showcase fine craftsmanship, and the
superior attention to detail on the outside is
but a prelude to the high-quality engineering
on the inside.
Products that work for you
The new Frigidaire with UltraStyle design is
built for the way you live today. Frigidaire's
leadership in people-focused designs has but
one goal: to make your life better by making
your kitchen tasks easier, more convenient
and less time-consuming. Here's how:
Refrigerators
With roomy and fully adjustable interiors,
Frigidaire top-freezer and side-by-side
refrigerators allow you to store and retrieve
food easily. Seamless designs, inside and
out, make cleaning easier and less necessary.
And Frigidaire's commitment to energy-
efficient designs and reduced-CFC insulation
leads the field in environmental excellence.
Ranges
For precise cooking performance on demand
throughout their long lives, you can't beat
Frigidaire's electric ranges. The smooth
cooktops and upswept designs eliminate
cracks and crevices that trap food and
grease. Frigidaire also offers a full
complement of gas ranges with European-
style sealed burners for easy cleaning. In
addition, you'll find a full line of builtin
wall ovens and electric and sealed burner
cooktops that fit nine out of 10 existing
appliance cutouts.
Dishwashers
With Frigidaire's new UltraPower' wash
system you will never need to pre-rinse
again. Powerful rinsing jets surge water
through the dishwasher to remove even the
toughest baked-on foods. A food disposer
chops up debris and sends it down the
drain. A super-fine filter ensures that only
the cleanest water ever touches your dishes.
Frigidaire's dishwashers not only work hard,
they look good too, because the sleek
UltraStyle design blends with any kitchen
design, no matter what your style.
Microwave ovens
From popcorn to roast beef, Rigidaire
microwave ovens take the guesswork out of
cooking. A unique 1,D00-watt power system,
a browning element and a tuntable ensure
you handle every cooking chore with tasty
results. Your meals cook up to 25 percent
faster than in conventional microwave ovens.
The UltraStyle design with curved edges
creates a distinctive look that complements
any decor. Models are available in three
sizes and in an over-the-range design
including a range hood.

ADDIRONDACK ANTIQUES
On September 25, more than 50 antiques
dealers will gather for the second annual
Adirondack Antiques Show. Held on the
grounds of the Adirondack Museum in
Blue Mountain Lake, N.Y., the show will
feature newly crafted furniture and acces-
sories as well as American antiques that
emphasize the distinctive rustic style of
the region. New to the show this year:
Adirondack fiddler Vic Kibbler-whom
the Smithsonian Institution recently
named the premier fiddler in the United
States-will perform throughout the day.
THE DECADDE THAT
ROARED
It was the age of bobbed hair, dance mar-
athons, and flagpole sitting. Beaded dress-
es and raccoon coats were all the rage.
Movie stars became royalty, and athletes,
heroes. The Herbert Hoover Library and
Museum in West Branch, Iowa, pays trib-
ute to the colorful culture of the early 20th
century's uproarious decade with ''The
Roaring Twenties,' an exhibit showcasing
more than 400 period objects. Included
are film clips, Al Capone's fedora, a bat
autographed by Babe Ruth, and Louis
Armstrong's trumpet.
Mah jongg ras a popular '20s pastime.
CELEBRATING 200 YEARS
To mark their town's bicentennial, 30
women from Cazenovia, N.Y., gathered
with sewing needles in hand to stitch a
commemorative quilt, Before presenting it
to their town, however, the women (some
of whom had never quilted before) entered
their creation in this year's American
Quilter's Society Show and Contest. It
won second prize in the group com-
petition. Local children caught the
quilting bug, too, producing a nine- by
15-foot quilt that will be shown at the
town's Bicentennial Country Fair on Sep-
tember 18. Also at the fair: demonstra-
tions, crafts, and food.

SAMPLING the great-tasting corn rec-
ipes entered in our recent contest had
Country Woman s panel of judges grin-
ning from ear to ear. (Sorry...I couldn't
resist just one ''corny'' line!)
Honestly, our taste-testers had plen-
ty to smile about as they savored the
golden corn casseroles, chowders, muf-
fins, fritters, relishes, salads and side
dishes shared by subscribers.
When the last kernels were cleaned
from the plates and the votes tallied,
Fresh Corn Salad from Carol Shaffer
of Cape Girardeau, Missouri took top
honors, earning high marks for its tangy,
fresh flavor and its eye-appealing colors.
Carol was delighted when I phoned
her with the good news, ''I make this
corn salad often for family get-togeth-
ers,'she told me. ''It's always a hit at in-
formal outdoor barbecues, too. I love
recipes that call for homegrown ingre-
dients-next to cooking, gardening is
one of my favorite hobbies.''
She's had lots of experience at both,
I learned. Raised in a rural area, Carol
was helping her mother prepare family
suppers and put up produce by age 10.
''Mom and I still cook together often
and always team up to prepare family
meals on holidays and birthdays,'' Car-
ol informed. ''We also get together to
swap and test out recipes we've clipped
from magazines and newspapers.
''Between us, we have 30 cookbooks
and files full of recipes-too many to
count!''
Counting on tasting them all is Car-
ol's husband-to-be, Danny. ''We're get-
ting married this summer, in time to
tend to and harvest our first mutual
garden,'' Carol related, ''We'll grow
cucumbers, peas, carrots, okra, toma-
toes and, of course, corn,''
Gardening, cooking and a full-time
job as a seamstress keep her busy, but
Carol assured there's always time for
Fresh Corn Salad. ''It tastes best when
you make it ahead and let it sit in the
refrigerator overnight,' she said. 'Then
just put it in your picnic cooler and go!''
Credit goes to her mother, Carol
added, for her entering CWY corn rec-
ipe contest. ''I'd nearly forgotten about
it when Mom reminded me of the ap-
proaching deadline. I sat right down
and wrote out my entry, never dream-
ing I'd win!''
Win she did, and soon she and three
guests will be enjoying her Grand Prize
free dinner at a favorite restaurant.
I can't wait to hear all about it after-
ward. You might say I'm all ears! [i]
AlEesllBe on This Ear of Corrn
EVERYBODY likes to spread a pat or
two of butter on a steaming ear of corn
on the cob. But butter inside the ear?
That's the fun behind this bright new
butter dish I recently came across-it's
shaped and colored just like a nice fresh
ear of sweet corn straight off the stalk!
It added lots of laughter to our CW
kitchen during testing for the corn rec-
ipe contest. And it will do the same for
your summer get-togethers.. .and, for
that matter, meals all year long.
There's no fooling when it comes to
the quality of this dish, however. Made
of glazed pottery, it retains its vibrant
green and yellow colors through many

out the possibility of pneumonia or some
other respiratory ailment. And before the
night was out,I performed a spinal tap in
hopes of ruling out meningitis.
The spinal fluid showed no signs of
meningitis. The chest X-ray was clean.
The mono test was negative, A blood
count showed that Caitlin had a surpris-
ingly normal number of white blood
cells-the number should have been at
least twice as high in someone with an in-
fection as severe as Caitlins appeared to
be. A few of the results were slightly off
she had a somewhat low level of sodium
and a borderline-low protein level in her
blood, and her liver appeared to be work-
ing a little bit harder than usual. Unfor-
tunately, these are nonspecific findings.
tests made it seem unlikely that she had a
viral infection or toxic shock syndrome.
Equally important, though, they didn't
rule out Rocky Mountain spotted fever:
for unknown reasons, the white blood cells
dont initially respond to this infection the
way they do to most others, so early blood
counts are often normal in these patients.
And though Caitlin didn't yet have the
characteristic rash found in more than
three-quarters of spotted fever cases and
she didn't remember a tick bite, the rest
of her symptoms fit-headache, fever,
nausea, muscle aches, lethargy.
Rocky Mountain spotted fever is an
infection caused by the bacterium Rick-
ettria rickettsii, which grows inside the
cells of ticks and mammals. Ticks can
pick up the bug by feasting on the blood
of an already-infected rabbit or rodent,
and they can pass it on to their offspring.
The disease was so named because Rocky
Mountain spotted fever was first reported
in states such as Montana and Idaho.
Ironically, it is now predominantly an Ap-
palachian disease: the majority of cases are
found in the Carolinas, Georgia, Mary-
land, Virginia, and Tennessee, though it
can be found almost anywhere in the
country (a large number of cases are re-
ported in Oklahoma, for instance). The
fever itself comes from the bite of an in-
fected tick-wood ticks in western states,
dog ticks in southeastern states-or from
crushing one of these ticks on skin that
complications: encephalitis, pneumonia,
kidney failure, shock. If it goes untreated,
Rocky Mountain spotted fever can kill as
many as 20 percent of the people it strikes;
even when treated, 6 to 7 percent of pa-
tients still succumb.
Thatk why my hunch didn't stop me
from worrying about Caitlin. And I'll ad-
mit I worried a little bit more when the
sensitive blood tests for antibodies to
Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spot-
ted fever came back-both were negative.
This sort of situation emphasizes the
occasional conflict between the art and
science of medicine, the battle between
instinct and technology. In my gut,I knew
what Caitlin had. But in my hands were
test results telling me something else.
Keeping in mind that it can take as many
as four weeks for patients with this infec-
tion to develop the antibodies these tests
look for, I decided to go with my gut.
I had already started Caitlin on two
intravenous antibiotics. One was a drug
that penetrates into most body fluids and
tissues and is effective against a broad
spectrum of bacterial infections, The
other was doxycycline, an antibiotic that
has a good track record in treating dis-
ease caused by unusual bugs like Rick-
ettsia and the Lyme bug, Borrelia kurg-
dorferi, In addition,I ordered rv fluids,
painkillers, and acetaminophen for her
fever, Then there was nothing to do but
watch and wait. Patience is a virtue for
both doctors and patients, though ar-
guably easier for the former.
gN HER sECOND HOSPITAL DAY,
Caitlins condition worsened, She
continued to spike high fevers and she
became increasingly confused.
''Are you feeling any better?'' I asked
her at one point.
''Huh?'' was her only answer. Repeat-
ing the question didn't help. Eventually I
did get her to answer a few simple ques-
tions-she told me her name and knew
that the woman by her bed was her
mother-but she couldn't tell me what day
of the week it was or even the month. She
was frighteningly weak for such a young
woman, despite the care of family and
friends constantly huddled around her bed.
They reminded me of covered wagons,
circling around to defend against an en-
me to pull magic out of my black bag
when all I could offer them was hope.
On her third hospital day-the Fourth
ofJuly, as it happened-Caitlins hands
and feet became puffy. Even though she
still wasn't responding to the antibiotics,
Iwas encouraged. This was the sign I was
looking for. By that evening, a faint pink
rash had appeared on her wrists and an-
kles-a very fine rash under the skin, the
kind of rash you can see but can't feel. A
Rocky Mountain spotted fever rash. So
onJuly Fourth, Caitlin andIcelebrated--
not independence but diagnosis.
By the next morning the rash had be-
come a darker shade of red, and it began
to move from her hands and feet to her
cestral contribution along with
their love is an annual human
drama to be witnessed at small
Southern Black colleges' com-
mencement exercises: Always the
auditorium is jam-packed (and it
usually is also hot). Of course, the
graduating class is seated facing the
stage, and their fmilies usually are
seated as a bloc at rear right. Among
the grandfatherly aged men--often
farmers-a goodly percentage are
wearing what is probably their only
suit, and the grandmotherly ladies
are wearing their choicest Sunday
frocks.
Maneuver yourself close enough
and in these grandparents' weath-
ered faces, and their often knobby-
knuckled, work-worn hands is a
special sort of visual history and her-
itage lesson. These dear elders-
bless their hearts--have seen and
endured so muchl They just sit
there like graven images, staring
straight ahead at wondrous happen-
ings up on the stage. It may well be
their first time ever on any colleges
grounds, which represents rela-
tively hallowed grounds to them,
for attending any college was even
beyond dreaming in their lives.
And that is why their grandchild
(sometimes great-grandchild) who
is seated somewhere up front,
wearing the academic hood and
gOWn, means more than mere
words could ever express-starting
with the fct that very likely its the
extended familys very first college
graduate. That already will have
caused the whole family to go
around walking a little taller, casu-
ally telling it to all they meet.

computers, Nintendo Game Boys, cellular
phones, videocassette recorders-all of
these products are coming under scrutiny.
The threat is a doublewhammy. There
are concerns that explosive devices could
be hidden in the circuitry of electronics
and that airport X-ray inspections are not
sophisticated enough to detect them. A
plastic explosive tucked away inside a
portable radio destroyed Pan Am flight
103over Scotland in 1988.
More likely, however, is the admittedly
bizarre-sounding risk that electromag-
netic signals emitted by the devices could
interferewiththe navigational gadgetry of
aircraft, Odd as that seems, some pilots
have reported planes veering off course
and gauges going haywire, attributable,
they suspect, to passengers using elec-
tronics. In one case, a pilot reported that
some instrumentation dials dimmed sud-
denly and the needles spun around wildly
on a flight departing Chicago. Then the
plane began flying off course. It turned
out a passenger in row nine was using a
lap-top computer. After he switched it off,
the panel light brightened and the naviga-
gizmos are, in fact, a risk. No one knows
for sure that those devices are what
caused the dysfunctional mechanics.
''There is no definitive answer yet on
mostelectronicdevices,'says Hank Price,a
spokesperson for the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA). ''With cellular
phones, some studies show they have inter-
fered with some portions of flights, but we
are not sure how and why and where, only
thatthey have the potential to do so.''
The Federal Communications Com-
mission prohibits the use of cellular
phones while planes are airborne; most
airlines don't allow passengers to use
them at all, even when the planes are on
the ground. (An aircraft's own devices,
including video screens for movies and
audio systems for earphones and tele-
phones, have been designed to conform
with the navigational system, so they do
notpose a problem.)
The Air Transport Association ATA),
which represents the major U.S. airlines
in Washington, requested industrywide

ing to achieve both. If you want to control thick
stay out late. I don't think it's good for children,''
The flip side to parenting is knowing when to let go.
''A child has to have an opportunity to make mistakes,''
Mrs. Clinton says, ''so she can mature. Trying to find that
balance is the history of good parenting, and all of us are
struggling to meet it.''
As Chelsea has grown, she has been given more re-
sponsibilities. Restrictions on TV viewing have been re-
laxed. And her parents promised her that the summer
after her 13th birthday she could have her ears pierced if
she wanted to. ''P-day is fast approaching,'' jokes Hillary.
lLast year Chelsea was also allowed to choose the
church she wanted to join. The President is a Southern
Baptist; Mrs. Clinton is Methodist. Chelsea went to both
and decided to be confirmed at her mother's church.
Now that she's 13, Chelsea also chooses her own
clothes-fortunately, as it turned out on her first day of
school in Washington. ''I used to like it a lot better when
she'd wear what I bought her,'' Mrs. Clinton says, laugh-
ing. ''For her first day of school I wanted her to wear this
cute outfit Ipants and a matching top] Id bought her.''
''Oh, Mother, I can't wear that,'' Chelsea told her.
''I make the big argument,'' Mrs. Clinton recalls, ''and
she said, 'Nobody will be wearing anything like that.' ''
And, of course, Chelsea, who wore the teenage uni-
form of jeans and a sweatshirt, was right. She looked like
everyone else and was quickly accepted. Within three
weeks, she was having sleepovers with friends.
Hillary Clinton describes her father, Hugh, as ''Mr.
Reality Check.'' But she says he's ''become one of the
most indulgent grandparents, I used to go to my father
and say: 'Dad, I really need a new pair of shoes. My shoes
have holes in them,' and he'd say, 'Have you done your
chores? Have you done this? Have you done that?' Chel-
sea goes to their house, and he says, 'Chelsea, want to
give you something.' ''
Dorothy Rodham elaborates on the story: ''Chelsea's
grandfather, to put it nicely, was thrifty with his own kids,
but he always gives Chelsea $5 when she comes to visit.
When she came home with all A's, he gave her $20. And
Hillary said to him: 'All you ever said to me when I came
home with A's was, ''You must be at an easy school,''' ':
Chelsea is still the only grandchild, ''a sore point with
the grandmothers,'' Mrs, Clinton says. ''I would have
loved to have had more children, but it just didn't work
out, so I have the best child there is.''
The Clintons celebrate holidays with a large extended
family-there are lots of cousins, particularly on the Pres-
ident's side-and with many very close friends.
''We go pretty far to celebrate every major holiday,''
says Mrs. Clinton. ''Bill goes crazy hiding Easter eggs.
He always finds great places. Now, he'll have more rooms
to torment us in,''
Christmas is the family's most important holiday. ''We
all go overboard,'' Mrs. Clinton says. ''We have carol
singing. We have a big family party where we make every-
one act out the 12 days of Christmas. They put on paper
antlers while they sing 'Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Rein-
deer,' We are so corny when it comes to these things.''
They also bake chocolate-chip cookies-the now fam-
ous recipe that became a symbol of the traditional side of
Hillary Rodham Clinton, the side that has nothing to do
with being one of the top lawyers in the country or the
chair of the President's Health Care Reform Taskforce. In
fact, Mrs. Clinton says baking cookies is a Christmas eve
tradition. She still does the baking with Chelsea.
And she is still not certain why people have trouble
seeing her as a mother, as well as a successful profession-
al woman. ''I think people should be able to show all their
sides,'' she reflects. ''I think women are being seen in
their various roles and are asking that all of those roles be
respected. There shouldn't be any one stereotype.''
By the time Chelsea grows up, Mrs, Clinton expects
the matter to be less controversial. ''The double standard
is eroding,'' she says, What she wants for her daughter is
what every parent wants: ''to be someone who has
enough of a sense of herself and the confidence to go with
it to make whatever choices are best suited for her.

them develop self-respect and the skills valuable to them,
so they can be the people God meant them to be,'' s

and the buck fell and the rest of the antelope ran.
That ancient loneliness turned out to be quite addictive,
though over the years its become harder to find. More
hunters have come into this corner of the desert, and
while most of them stick to plainly tracked roads, some
bring all-terrain vehicles and ride into the edges of the
rougher hill., They don't kill many antelope, but they
push them back. I still hunt this country with my wife,
Eileen, but now we bring packframes to haul our antelope
out of the far canyons, the same packframes we use for
bigger game in the mountains. Its tougher, but we still
find our loneliness,
Four years after we started these long treks to the
empty places, we took Eileens son Sean along. He
lived, for the most part, with his father near the Idaho
border, and though he'd hunted for three years, he
didn't yet have the combination of patience and quick-
ness needed to kill a timber deer, let alone an elk, He
was discouraged, so we took him out where the
deer and the antelope play, setting up camp at the
high end of a long ridge overlooking the edge of
the badlands.
We dug a pit in the sand, built a fire, and
cooked elk steaks. The sky turned slate and the
three-quarter moon singled out the buttes as if
they were cut from gray paper, Even in the moon-
light, we saw more stars than you ever might, the
horizons wide as oceans and far from city lights.
The Milky Way was not just a flat line but some-
thing nearly tactile, like flakes of mica suspended
in black ice, We ate our steaks and heard coyotes,
and told Sean about the antelope we'd find and
where we'd find them.
The next morning the moon was down and the
sun well up when we left camp, our daypacks full of
lunch and water on our packframes. We headed across a
series of washes toward the long low line of red clay we
call the China Wall, 2 miles from camp. On the other side
of the Wall is a little unroaded valley, in which lies one of
the few natural ponds in this northern desert, fed by an al-
kaline spring that grows cattails and geese. The pond al-
ways has fresh pronghorn tracks around it.
On the way to the Wall we found a desert tragedy: four
rabbit feet and a white cotton tail. No tracks were set in
the hard sand to tell us if it was the work of a coyote or
golden eagle. We crossed a dry wash, and over the hill
found a single doe pronghorn, which Sean turned down,
wanting a buck. Eileen stalked and shot it at 75 yards,
After field-dressing the doe, we draped it belly-up over a
tall sage to cool, tying orange ribbon on the sagebrush to
mark the place and keep birds away.
Then we crossed the Wall at the gap near the east
end. From there we could see the (Coninued on page 97)

that have produced for me, and that oth-
er experimenters have told me about.
The Flatfish in the smaller F7 size
(about 2}2 inches long) is a great com-
promise for both large and small trout in
lakes or streams, It can be cast or trolled.
The Jointed Pikie, introduced seventy
years ago, may sound absurd, but in mod-
est sizes (3 to 4 inches) this old floater-
diver is a lethal dose for trout, In streams,
its on par with the Flafish. Another ex-
tremely productive lure type, and the
technique for using it, was divulged to me
by an Eastern angler. He used a minnow-
like floater-diver. There are many of
these, and theyre tremendously popular
and effective nowadays for bass. Rapala,
Rebel, Bagley. Cordell, and many other
manufacturers make these models, Those
about 4inches long are fine.
''Tve been taking rainbows of 4 pounds
up in lakes by casting a -inch minnow-
imitating floater with a short plastic ip.
After it splashes down,I let it lie until the
circles, on flat water, begin to smooth out.
Then I jerk the lure under, crank twice,
and let it rise and ie again briefly. Ive also
used this same technique successfully on
large streams, casting upstream to the head
of a long, smooth-surfaced pool. As the
lure floats back, jerk it under, but dont
crank. Just take up slack and repeat. Colors
and shapes resembling those of disabled
fish clinch the sale on floater-divers.'
Two classes of trout anglers will dis-
dain the bass plug routine: bait fisher-
men, and purist fly fishermen, neither of
whom are likely to budge. The average
angler sees trout rise, or reads the vast ar-
ray of fly-fishing literature, and is brain-
washed into thinking that dry, wet, and
nymph flies are what take trout, along
with the occasional streamer or spinner.
One fly-fishing addict boasted that any-
thingIcould do with a plug, he could do
with flies, including big streamers.
He may have been correct. Fly fishing is
myfavorite discipline, too. But off-trail ex-
periments have always intrigued me, and
occasionally the off-trail approach wins
the race. For example, the last time my
family and I went through Yellowstone
Park it was September. We were headed
for the south exit, and we stopped for
lunch beside Lewis Lake, which was glass-
flat, stippled intermittently by rises of sub-
stantial trout. I yearned for one fish with
which to make a last trout supper before
returning home to Texas.
lDonning waders,I walked out as far as
possible, and laid down dries, wets,
nymphs, and finally a streamer. Still
goose-egged after 2 hours, I thought
with irritation, TIl put a op to tbi non-
sense. Irigged a spinning rod.There were
no lure restrictions at the time, so I tied
on a lipped, minnow-type plug, made a
long cast, and then followed the routine
Id learned. After jerking once as the plug
came back to the surface,I thought I saw
minor water movement nearby. I gently
jggled the lure. For the next few minutes
the limber rod was half-circled, water
kept sloshing and flying, and my heart
was thumping. With smiling satisfac-
tion,I finally beached the trout, a brown
of approximately 3 pounds.
Driving on south, I was inwardly
chuckling, thinking of old Father
Finegan, and how years ago hed consid-
ered that big brown sinfully caught.
Most likely, he was gracefully arcing his
beloved fly rod over pollution-free wa-
ters in a better place nowadays. I won-
dered if he knew about that bright yel-
low plug with red and black polka dots,
about the Jointed Pikie, or what had just
by its younger members, the good, late
Queen had gathered as many of them as
she could, and had come to dedicate an
AIDS hospital sponsored by the Angli-
can Church. The murderer had hidden
beneath the reviewing stand, and set off
the charge himself. He left no note of ex-
planation; the IRA was extremely miffed
that an amateur had accomplished what
it had failed to do.
Diana shuddered. Wills and Harry had
been scheduled to be there, but the night
before both had come down with chick-
enpox. The surviving Windsors had been
devastated. Dear old Queen Mum had
succumbed from the terrible shock. Yet,
some good had come of it: Andrew and
Fergie had been reunited by the catas-
trophe. Both came to realize the impor-
tance of a good marriage, and decided to
work hard to maintain theirs. Princess
Anne, Di's sister-in-law, had been a bul-
wark, arguing successfully that Diana be
made Regent of the underage King. Eng-
land had not had a boy king in centuries,
and Diana was more than well aware
that though she was not an intellectual,
suddenly the very existence of the
monarchy depended upon her. She
prayed, and then she relied upon her
instincts, which to her great surprise,
proved extremely sound.
And now her job was over. On July 15,
2004, William was crowned King of
England. Diana smiled to herself. Her
son looked so handsome in his ermine-
trimmed robes. The country would be in
good hands, and the next job would be to
find a wife for Wills. How very much
she wanted him to fall in love, like she
had, once, so long ago.
She turned at the knock upon her door.
''My dears!'' she greeted her sons. ''This
is a surprise ... '' Her voice died in her
throat when she noticed her paramour,
Lord James X, was with them.
William, always quick to the point,
said,''James tells me that you two are in
love, Mother. He has asked my permis-
sion to marry you. I thought you should
know that Harry and I could not be more
delighted. You have our blessing.'''Then
the King pulled his younger brother by
the arm, and they departed the room.
''I could not wait,'' Lord X said softly.
''Iam glad you did not,'' Diana replied,
flying into his warm, welcoming arms
s they closed around her.
Sometimes a happy ending is worth ;
waiting for. This one certainly had been. l
watched Charles watching the riots, she
suddenly saw him as he'd been during
their engagement: proud, confident, de-
termined to be the best king that Eng-
land had ever known. And in that mo-
ment of reckoning, Diana also admitted
to herself the folly of much of her own
behavior during their endless battles.
They had fought a war, and, in the end,
they had both lost.
Diana turned away from the TV and
started walking toward the door. Then
she began to run. Behind her, Yuri
guessed her intention and called out,
''Diana, don't be a fool! It would take a
miracle to put Charles on the throne!''
The door slammed behind her.
Charles looked up in angry surprise as
Diana walked into his study. ''What the
hell are you doing here?'' he demanded,
studying her face for signs of triumph at
his dire predicament.
Diana smiled. ''I've come to return
something I took away from you.''
His voice rang with angry sarcasm.
''What's tha?''
''A throne,'' his wife said somberly.
Charles's fury at her-and himself-
dissolved as he noticed the softness in
ner eyes and the maturity in her face. He
new what she was offering as clearly
as he knew his affair with Camilla was
over. ''I don't deserve your help,'' he
admitted, his voice awkward.
Diana laughed.''You're right''she said.
She held out her hand to him.
And he took it.

low the late Joc Dey. Nicklaus chairs
the meeting but, theoretically, has no
vote. ''You might say this time,' Marr
said, ''he gave us a little push''
When [ack spoke up to announce
there was a name he wanted to toss
into the mix, none of them could have
guessed the one he had in mind.
''Sooner or later, were going to have to
get into the modern era,' he told them.
''I know the policy is not to honor any-
one still competing, but Arnold Palmer
is not going to stop completely until
hes 85''
The captains looked around at each
other with raised eyebrows and soft
smiles. The motion was made and
passed by acclamation. ''I better call

bering Hogan. When Palmer came to
the phone, he couldn't answer immedi-
ately. He had to compose himself and
call back. The answer was yes.
Furthermore, they would play in
each other's tournaments for the first
time in nine years. (They would miss

make their own at the same time, but
there was a grace in that, too.)

fT) My fur year old is a picks
f eater.I don't think he's ever
7' wllingb eaten a vegetsble-
f except French fries! Should
I insist that he eat certain foods?
A. No. Don't force your son to eat
anything. That's the wrong way to
go. Offer him a variety of foods,
incorporate vegetables into meals
in new ways, or use fruits instead.
Did you know that four year olds
are known for their single-minded
eating patterns? At this age, some
children insist on one food for a
period of time, then suddenly
switch to another-so there is every
reason to encourage new tastes.
).My five-month-old baby has
been breast-feeding exclusively.
My friends now tell me she's ready
for cereal. Are they correct?
A. Yes, The American Academy
of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends
that solids be introduced at four to
six months, Check with your
pediatrician.
). Because my neighbor worries
a lot about her weight, she gives
were not overweight as young
children, and eating patterns
change greatly between childhood
and adulthood.
).What percentage of a child's
diet should come from fat?
A. Approximately 30 percent, the
same as for adults.
J. My pediatrician wants to
check my nine year old's
cholesterol. Is this necessary?
A.Your pediatrician probably
sees a particular reason for this
test. Current AAP guidelines
recommend screening for choles-
terol when there is a history
of early heart or vascular disease
or high blood-cholesterol levels
in one or both parents. Testing is
also recommended when a
youngster has high blood pressure,
diabetes, or is overweight-all risk
factors for developing heart
disease.
J.Should children take vitamin
supplements?
A.'There is no real need for the
average infant or child over age one
to have vitamin supplements. An
exception to this rule is the breast-
continued on page 208
be wcancd at any timc, hut we rccom1-
mcnd hrcast-fccding through as much of
the infant's first year as possible.
Q. How often should a newborn be fed?
A. Fceding a ncwborn is a comprommise
hctwccn on dcmand and what's possiblc
for thc mothcr. On average, hahics are
fcd cvery two to threc hours,
), My ten-year-old daughter's appetite
has recently jumped up considerably.
Suddenly she's asking for second help-
ings and nibbling after school. Why this
change?
A. The average ten-ycar-old girl is about
to go through a phenomenal growth
spurt. Your daughter is eating more bc-
causc girls grow rapidly as thcir hormones
shift toward adolescence and the onset of
mcnstruation and puberty hcgins.
). My friend makes all her own baby
food. Is her child better nourished as a
result?
A. No. Commercially preparcd baby
food is a perfectly acceptable choice for
parents to make.
). How important is fruit in a child's
diet?
A. Fruit has vitamins, minerals, fiber,
and can supply a child with cncrgy. You
find the same nutrients in other foods,
but fruit is tasty and low-fat, too.
. Obesity runs in my husband's fam-
ily, and my seven-year-old son has a big
appetite. How can I limit his diet with-
out turning into a nag?
A. If he is growing consistently and his
wcight is not far out of line for his
height, there may be no reason to be
concerned. At seven, active children eat
to mcet their growth and energy needs.
Howcver, if your pediatrician tells you
that your child is quite heavy for his
hcight, you may want to think about
lowcr-caloric alternatives to some of his
favorite foods. But don't nag and don't
worry, Emphasize the value of exercise
and try to provide the right balance of
foods,
). During busy workweeks, making
meals is difficult. My children love fast-
food dinners, but I worry about relying
on 'junk.'' How bad is a steady take-out-
diet?
A. Thcre is nothing wrong with take-out
food as long as you don't order the same
thing all the time. Pizza and hamburgers,
in particular, can have lots of fat and
salt. So order pizza one night, then
turkey or hroiled chicken sandwiches the
ncxt, and after that hamburgers or pizza
(without the extra cheese, peppcroni, or
sausage that adds fat). Round out the
meals with a salad and offer plenty of
fruit.

the water in which rice has been cooked
will help a child recover from diarrhea?

If unexpected company arrives, impress
your guests with a salad of corn, red pep-
pers, black beans, and avocado, to which
you might add crab meat (if you live near

One of the easiest and most savory reci-
pes for corn off the cob comes from Ishmail
Merchant's Indian Cuisine. Mr. Merchant
is a film producer and a man around the
kitchen. Although not long on text, this
Very personal book demonstrates how one
person fused the traditions he grew up with
and those of his adopted homeland. His
cayenned-corn recipe must be made with
fresh corn, and it is worth waiting a whole
year for.
ISHMAIL MERCHANT'S
CAYENNED CORN O
1. Cut as much uncooked fresh corn as you
have mouths to feed. (For 4 people you will
need about 4 or 5 ears of corn.)
2. Melt 3 tablespoons of butter in a skillet
and add the corn, a couple of chopped-up
garlic cloves, k teaspoon cayenne (or more
if you like heat), and salt to taste. Cook this
mixture a few minutes over medium heat.
3. Add V cup cream (half-and-half or even
milk will do), cook the mixture for another
8 minutes or so, and serve it hot. Serves 4.
This multicultural dish is mellow and
sweet as well as spicy and suave. With a
side dish of basmati rice it is pure heaven.
If you are feeding friends from other
countries, corn fritters are what you are
looking for. Because they are no longer
fashionable you can even find red-blooded
Americans who haven't eaten them since
childhood.
CORN FRITTERS
1. In a bowl stir 2 cups water and 9 cup
olive oil, a little at a time, into 2 cups all-
purpose flour seasoned with a generous
pinch of salt, stir in 1 large egg yolk, and
stir the batter until it is smooth.
2. Whip 1 large egg white until it is just
stiff, fold it into the batter, and let the batter
stand for 1 hour.
3. Stir 3V cups uncooked fresh corn (cut
from about 6 large ears) into the batter.
4. In a large deep skillet heat about 1 inch of
olive oil or light sesame oil with a garlic
clove over medium high heat until the garlic
turns golden, remove the garlic with a
skimmer, and throw it away. When the oil
reaches 375% F. on a deep-fat thermometer,
stir the batter to distribute the corn evenly
and in the skillet fry rounded tablespoons
of the batter, about 6 at a time, for 2 to
2 minutes on each side, or until the fritters
are golden.
5. Transfer the fritters as they are cooked to
paper towels to drain and try not to eat them
all right then and there in the kitchen.
Makes about 20 fritters.
Some people like these fritters with ap-
plesauce, as in potato pancakes. Some like
them with maple syrup. ButIlike mine with
salsa on the side.
This is a summer dish, and this salsa can
only be made in the summer. You need a
few big ripe tomatoes, one brand-new on-
ion, one sweet green pepper, and a chili as
hot as you can stand. Dice everything up
(wearing rubber gloves for the chili) and
dress the salsa with olive oil, celery salt,
lime juice, and minced garlic. Children
probably won't like this, but grown-ups
will. Salsa or no salsa, one bite of these frit-
ters will have your friends telling you about
their days at summer camp when they lined
up at the kitchen hatchway begging the
cook for a few more.
That is the magic of corn, America's
most emblematic food. It evokes memories
of sunburn and swimming in the lake and
wandering on the beach looking for shells.
Corn on the cob is true soul food and re-
quires of the exhausted cook nothing more
than a large pot of boiling water and a few
people willing to do the shucking. Further-
more, it provides entertainment for small
children who find corn silk irresistible.
If you still have corn left over, fate has
called out to you that you must make corn
relish. I would not even try to resist this
call.Ihave made corn relish inspired by the
recipe in Helen Witty's irreplaceable, in-
valuable, and all-around excellent book
Fancy Pantry. As a result-I am not
ashamed to reveal-my corn relish won a
blue ribbon at the agricultural fair in West
Cornwall.
BLUE RIBBON
SWEET CORN RELISH
1. Combine in a large pan (I use a preserv-
ing pan): 6 cups uncooked fresh corn (cut
from about 12 ears), 1 large red pepper,
diced, 1 green pepper, diced, about k to 1
cup firmly packed dark brown sugar (de-
pending on how sweet you like it), 2 table-
spoons coarse salt, 2 tablespoons English-
style dry mustard, 1V teaspoons ground
celery seed (or use celery salt and cut the
amount of salt accordingly), V teaspoon
cayenne (or use fresh hot chilies to taste),
and 1% cups cider vinegar. (Corn relish,
like chutney, is friendly and hard to mess
up. If you don'thave dry mustard, use some-
thing else: turmeric, garam masala, or curry
powder. Taste is the deciding factor.)
2. Bring this mixture to a boil over medium
high heat, stirring from time to time, then
lower to a simmer. When the mixture be-
gins to cook down (which should take about
25 minutes), add 2 cups chopped onion.
Cook the mixture for only a few minutes
more so that the onions stay crunchy.
3. Ladle the relish into about six V-pint
sterilized Mason-type jars (see below for
GoURMET's sterilizing procedure) and seal
the jars. Put the jars in a water bath canner
or on a rack set in a deep kettle, add enough
hot water to the canner or kettle to cover the
jars by 2 inches, and bring it to a boil. Pro-
cess the jars, covered, for 10 minutes,
transfer them with tongs to a rack, and let
them cool completely. Store the jars in a
cool dark place.
You may never have to buy Christmas
presents again. Your friends will be de-
lighted (or puzzled, but ultimately delight-
ed) by your gift. Many people are not
familiar with corn relish, and it is up to you
to enlighten them.
And even when everyone is tired of corn
on the cob, you will never have to pass a
sign marked Fresh Corn without stopping
for an armload or two.

TO STERILIZE JARS AND GLASSES
FOR PICKLING AND PRESERVING O
Wash the jars in hot suds and rinse them
in scalding water. Put the jars in a kettle and
cover them with hot water. Bring the water
to a boil, covered, and boil the jars for 15
minutes from the time that steam emerges
from the kettle. Turn off the heat and the let
the jars stand in the hot water. Just before
they are to be filled invert the jars onto a
kitchen towel to dry. (The jars should be
filled while they are still hot. ) Sterilize the
jar lids for 5 minutes, or according to the
manufacturer's instructions.@
This column is one of a series of articles
hat Laurie Colwin sent to us before her un-
imely death in October, 1992. The articles
vill run throughout the year.
7 ears ago, in a group-therapy
session,Iheard a story thatI
L have never forgotten. It en-
lightened me to how a Higher Power
works in our lives. Itwent like this:
'Hey, Father,' said a man talking
to a priest. 'You got it all wrong about
this God stuff. He doesn't exist. I
oughta know.''
*Why's that, my son?'
*Well, when I was ice-fishing in
the Arctic far from the nearest village,
a blizzard blew up with wind and
blinding snow.Iwas a goner. So Igot
down on my knees and prayed real
hard, begging God for help.''
'And did He help you?'
'Heck no. God didn't lift a finger.
Some Eskimo appeared out of no-
where and showed me the way''
Ittook me a while to recognize the
Eskimos in my life. And I had needed
them so desperately.
Igrew up haunted by my maternal
grandfather, John B. Watson, a fa-
mous psychologist who founded a
movement called behaviorism. It
taught parents to resist their chil-
dren's natural bonding needs, which
he considered undesirable. There
was to be no cuddling,no kissing, few
outward signs of affection. As a result
of this kind of treatment as a child,
my mother later learned to use alco-
hol to numb her feelings of isolation.
And my father, a high-powered ad-
vertising executive, also succumbed
to alcohol. Despite their affliction,
they loved me deeply.I grew up with
my younger brother in affluent Wes-
ton, Connecticut, where I discovered
my calling. At 1lIjoined the Silver
Nutmeg Theatre Company with roles
in plays like Alice is Woderland and
Little Women in elementary schools
around the state.
Smitten by the theater, I met one
of my first Eskimos, Eva Le Galli-
enne, the legendary actress, who was
teaching at the White Barn Theatre
nearby. Miss Le G. was a small, de-
lightful woman with a tiny nose, vio-
let eyes and translucent skin. She
wore lavender cashmere sweaters
and periwinkle-blue dresses. A loving,
giving person, she taughtyoungsters
like me as well as professionals. I
learned so much from her-how to
feel and project emotions, and to let
''the sacred fire strike' by eliminating
self so that the character one is play-
ing shines through.
Miss Le G, also inspired me spiri-
tually. Though Mom and Dad were
not religious, I was attracted to
church. Sunday mornings Id hop on
my bicycle and pedal to the Norfield
Congregational Church, where I sang
solos in the choir. My early days in a
dysfunctional family were traumatic,
to be sure, but it was in church thatI
was reminded of hope and goodness.
The power and abundance of that
hope became very clear to me one
beautiful summer afternoon when I
was l6 and just back from a rehearsal
at a nearby Shakespeare festival. I
was walking in a field, and as I
stopped by a tree I suddenly had an
being used by some greater Power
and try to obey it.''
Itwas my belief in a spiritual life
that sustained me through the diffi-
cult years to come. As a teenager I
suffered a shortlived marriage to an
older man who beat me mercilessly.
Later I was offered a leading role in
the film Come Fly With Me, but a doc-
tor misdiagnosed my hepatitis. WIth-
out proper treatment,I got too sick to
take the role.
Then, most devastating of all, was
my father's suicide. It happened after
Dad, tormented by alcohol, had lost
job after job and succumbed to hope-
lessness. Mother and I were eating
lunch when a gunshot rang out from
the bedroom. We dashed in to find he
had shot himself in the head. For a
year I kept hearing that gunshot and
was barely able to work at all.
Finally, after fighting my own al-
v I T A L S I G N S
fleas. On this day, all 7500 of them are
happily standing upside down biting
through a plastic membrane to suck up
the cow's blood on the other side. One
Artificial Dog produces 12,000 fleas a
day, doing work that formerly employed
about 25 real dogs and cats,
This morning,Georgi is gathering eggs-
He does it by removing the pens from the
dog, then opening each one over a funnel-
shaped ''flea separator,'' The adult fleas
hop out and fall into the funnel, where the
vacuum's suction pins them against a
screen ''in a high wind,'' as Georgi puts it,
The eggs stay behind.
I comment on how this miracle system
lets no fleas escape when, sure enough,
one gets away, We both dive to the floor to
grab him, but the flea fakes left and goes
right, then right again and disappears.
''If you don't get them by the second
hop, you usually don't get them,' Georgi
says, We don't.
But never mind. Right now, some
800,000 of its kin are stowed safely in
Ziploc bags in Georgi's freezer, ready for
sale. The question is, Who wants them?
Mostly it's big drug companies and
chemical labs trying to help me-the lady
with two cats, tour dogs, and Oriental
rugs that come to life each summer as
Ctenocephalides felis, the common flea,
takes over my home.
And helping they are. By making an
extract from Georgi's livestock, Greer
Laboratories, Inc., in Lenoir, North Car-
olina, can now offer allergists and veteri-
narians antigen tests to tell whether you
or your dog or cat are itching because of
fleas or something else.
Even better, during the past few years
companies have come up with a genuine
flea-relief breakthrough: new age com-
pounds called insect growth regulators,
It's about time that something did the
trick, Professional exterminators say fleas
come right after cockroaches and termites
as the nation's most troublesome pests.
Consider that 110 million dogs and cats
are scattered among the nation's 94 mil-
lion households. And that fleas can be
debilitating to young animals and tor-
turous to those with allergies, In regions
of high humidity, flea allergy dermatitis is
the number one complaint at the vet's,
Americans spend a million dollars a day
fighting fleas at home and almost three
times that much-$1 billion each year-if
you fgure in vet bills and exterminators.
''Oh well, 'A reasonable amount of
fleas is good for a dog,''' says Georgi,
quoting homespun philosopher David
ow t4 Hurt a Hlea

Use an insect growth regulator. Look for
products containing either methoprene or
fenoxycarb, sold as do-it-yourself sprays,
Used properly, they're risk-free for you
and your animals but death to flea eggs
and larvae. ''Foggers'' with these growth
regulators are also good but tricky to use.
They mostly spread tiny droplets that fall
straight down and won't drift under sofas
or around corners, No matter what you
use, wash the pet on the same day,
Vacuum, vacuum, vacuum. You'll not only
suck up lots of flea eggs, you'll starve any
lingering larvae. Use the powered, rotat-
ing ''beater brush'' attachment on your
vacuum. Then take that pointy crevice
tool and get tough with the couch and
baseboards, Repeat early and often,
Wash your pet's bedding once a week with
detergent, Dry on high heat, Flea pupae
die at temperatures above 95'F and at
humidities below 50 percent, If your pet
doesn't have bedding, give him some.
You could even put a towel down in the
car or under a favorite napping bush.
Consider fiea-killing dusts. If you can stand
the mess, diatomaceous earth supposedly
dehydrates fleas and their larvae when you
sprinkle it on your pet's bedding. It's hard
to find, though (check pet shops), and all
flea experts aren't convinced it helps.
Borate powder (ak,a, boric acid or borax)
is tougher on fleas, but you have to spread
the stuff on your furniture and carpets and
then make a point of not cleaning it up.

isten carefully and
you'll hear the sounds
of summer echoing
across your neighborhood. They're
the sounds of hammers ringing and
saws singing as homeowners build
backyard decks.
Wooden decks represent the sin-
gle most popular, do-it-yourself
home improvement project. There's
no mystery to why decks are so pop-
ular: They're easy to build, afford-
able and an economical way to gain
valuable outdoor living space. And,
decks hold their resale value.
According to a survey conducted by
Remodeling, a trade magazine for re-
modeling contractors, you can ex-
pect to recoup nearly 84 percent of a
deck's cost when you sell your home.
Here are five distinct decks that
range from a modest platform to an
elegant, multi-level structure. And
only basic carpentry skills are re-
quired to build them.
ra-cotta border tiles, If your home al-
ready has a concrete patio, you can
simply lay tile directly over it using
thin-set mortar. If the patio is too
small, enlarge it by excavating, forming
and pouring a concrete extension.
Redwood was chosen for this pro-
ject because of its natural beauty, di-
mensional stability and resistance to rot
and insect infestation. (Note that this is
true only of the heartwood grades of
redwood cut from the center of the log.
The sapwood grades offer less resis-
tance.) The understructure frame of
the sun deck was built of 2x8 redwood
joists spaced 2-4 in, on-center. The left-
hand end of the deck (closest to the
house) rests on the concrete patio and
is nailed to a pressure-treated 2x- cleat.
The cleat is fastened to the patio with
lead expansion shields and '-in,-dia, x
3-in, lag screws.
The 2x6 redwood decking was
nailed to the joists with galvanized
common nails. Redwood is soft and
easy to nail, but be sure to pre-drill
pilot holes at the boards' ends to pre-
vent splitting.
On the landing, at the base of the
stairs, is a cozy redwood bench con-
structed of 4xs and 2x6s, Above the
bench is a modest shade arbor featuring
an overhead lattice made of 2x2s, Each
of the steps in the stairway leading to
the balcony deck is made of seven red-
wood 2x4s. The 2x4s were bolted to-
gether to form massive 33-in,-thick x
10V-in,-deep steps.
The balcony deck is built off the
upstairs master bedroom and offers a
private perch for enjoying the Sunday
morning paper. The deck is enclosed
with a railing made of 4x- posts, 2x44
rails and a 2x6 cap. Note that the 2x4
rails were installed horizontally to cre-
ate fewer obstructions and offer a bet-
ter view than would have vertical
balusters.

we are as good as the best--there is not a single plant at
Chelsea that you dont find at Courson, And I am happy to
say that the quality oez nous is sometimes even better,''
The diversity Fustier refers to embraces perennials, shrubs,
trees, threatening-looking carnivorous plants, aquatics in pools
dug specially for the show, alpines, impossibly bosomy hy-
drangeas, bougainvilleas and daturas from the C6te d'Azur,
and stylish bamboos from the old pottery town of Anduze in
the Cevennes mountains, Although foreign purveyors are wel-
come and do participate (including, as a matter of fact, some
from England), most of the nursery people are French. No one
doubts the assumption that they are the countrys best.
Staged in a corner of the 86-acre park at Courson, the event
also includes booths filled with hand-blown hurricane lamps
and teak tables to sit them on; gently worn, irresistibly nostal-
gic antiques like watering cans and wheelbarrows; pottery; stat-
uary; paving tiles; potpourri; state-of-the-art tools; botanical
watercolors (artists are present and pleased to meet you); prac-
tical accessories like gloves, leaf bags, aprons and straw hats,
With its friendly boutique atmosphere and naturalistic set-
ting under the famous cloud-strewn skies of the Ile-de-France,
Courson is for connoisseurs and neophytes alike. Last May,
20,000 people turned up to shop at the stands of 150 ex-
hibitors, (The same month 750 stand-holders at Chelsea at-
tracted 180,000 visitors,) When Roy Strong, the English
author of garden-design books, attended in 1992, he wrote
that Courson had 'a delectable, fresh, amateur pell-mell air
about it, What it lacked in finish it more than made up for in
joie de vivre.'' This year garden writer Robin Lane Fox ad-
monished his fellow Brits for all their unkind jokes at the ex-
pense of the French, and urged them to go. 'The show has a
wonderful feel of informality and weekend market which has
still not been lost to its huge success,' he noted.
HelEne Fustier does not discount the glamorous high-society
patronage of such gardeners as Princess Greta Sturdza, whose
Le Vasterival in Normandy is famous for its azaleas and rhodo-
dendrons. Nor does Fustier take for granted the attention
shown by landscape architect Pascal Cribier, one of a team
working on the Tuileries gardens in Paris, and American garden
designer Madison Cox, the author ofArtiz' Garens (Abrams,
November 1993). And yet what interests Fustier most is the
nurturing of what she calls''a new public.' Gardening has tken
on an importance that was unthinkable in France even ten years
ago. The French are interested in plants, but are not always
knowledgeable. At Courson, they ask ingenuous questions like,
''Wll it be hard to grow?' 'Is it pretty when it flowers?' Es-
hibitors are unusually willing to share their expertise.
Whats in it for the American gardener? The jump on new
Continental trends and a cash-and-carry policy that will prob-
ably find you clutching a half-dozen nascent clematis for the
plane ride home. (Note: U.S. Customs allows seeds and
certain bulbs into the country, but a special permit is required
from the Department of Agriculture for plants and shrubs.)
Chelsea has traditionally frustrated attendees, not just with its
hurly-burly atmosphere, but with its iron refusal to allow sell-
ing until the final day. At Courson, selling begins on the af-
ternoon of day one, but stands also have fixed displays,
ensuring that there is something for visitors to look at until the
shows last moments,
Tom Cooper, editor of Hortiadture magazine, thinks highly
enough of Courson to have brought over a group of Ameri-
cans in May 1993. The group saw signs of what Patrice Fustier
identifies as the new ''back-to-natural' movement, 'Whereas
in recent years in France the trend has been toward formal,
rectilinear gardens, now it is loose and supple,' he observes,
''As a reaction to the mode for pale and tender colors there is a
whole palette of strong yellows that evokes the Italian Riviera
of the twenties and thirties And Gilles Clement, who recently
designed the Parc Citroen along the Seine in Paris, is talking a
lot about black flowers like dark iris and violas.'
Fustier says fashions in gardening are so international now
that if a plant pleases the French there is every reason to be-
lieve it will please not only Americans, but the Germans and
the Dutch as well. ''A newly introduced peony with good color
that does well in both sun and shade, that is easy to grow--
the professional will want to buy it at Courson, and the ama-
teur will want to order it at home,' he says,
Many attendees with long experience of Courson make the
Pepiniere et Paysages a first stop. This nursery from the Rhone
Alps offers more than fifty species of magnolias, as well as a
catalog of endangered fruits, Pepiniere de Coudray from
Haute-Normandie is famous for its shade- and peat-loving
plants, Asiatic primulas, gentians, meconopsi and lilies,
Despalles, of Paris, specializes in hostas, orchids and bulbs.
The Fustiers knew little about gardening before lunching
Courson. The show has its roots in the 1976 drought that left
many of the chäteaus celebrated rhododendrons almost dead.
The drought triggered the rehabilitation of the park and the
interest of a botanical society wanting to visit. One of the
groups members, a nurseryman, asked if he could try selling
plants, and the Fustiers agreed. If people buy plants that thrive,
Helne said to herself, they will return the next season, and
the next and the next. That, of course, was eleven years ago.
She was absolutely right.

''In the realm of decoration I am only interested in what is strictly necessary, what is ab-
solutely essential,' announces De Padova, who was born in the mountains around Lake Como
in the Lombardy region of northern Italy. 'Nothing counts more for me than simplicity. Along
with space it is one of todays great privileges. My furniture is for rigorous people with a taste for
minimalism. They dress simply-in Ralph Lauren or Giorgio Armani rather than Gianni Ver-
sace. I would even say they eat simply. And certainly when it comes to furnishing their homes,
they want to do that simply too. You know, less ir more,'
The core of De Padovas collection is designed by Vico Magistretti, the 73-year-old Mi-
lanese former architect and town planner. He is known for the molded fiberglass Selene chair
he created in 1968 for Artemide, the company that would later provide seed money for Et-
tore Sottsasss seriously crazy Memphis group. Magistrettis furniture for De Padova, such
as his elegantly anonymous Tani Moto cubbyhole bookcases in beechwood, reflects their
shared credo that nothing should be sacrificed to organization, and that what works domes-
tically should also succeed in the workplace. His coolly restrained Shine table--a chamfered
oval laminate top on splayed legs in a satin-finish aluminum and steel alloy--is meant as

comparison, less than 10% of the deaths
among people age 40 and older are
traffic fatalities. Yet a common mistake
that families make is to assign the small-
est, lightest car to the youngest driver.
Based on weight alone, a 3,300-
pound Oldsmobile Eighty-Eight
Royale, for example, can be expected to
provide better protection in a crash
than a 2,500-pound Geo Storm.
What about putting young drivers in
sport-utility vehicles or vans, which of-
ten top 4,000 pounds? It's probably not
a good idea--not because the vehicles
are inherently dangerous but because
inexperienced drivers may not exercise
the proper precautions for handling
such large cars, Some minivans and
utility vehicles score well in the IIHS in-
jury reports primarily because they are
often driven by adults transporting
small children.
lLarge cars also provide the best side-
impact protection because they have
more surface area over which to dis-
perse crash forces. Four-door sedans
typically provide better protection than
impact, prevents the driver's head firom
hitting the steering wheel. A passenger
bag, while desirable, is not as critical.
''You always hit the steering wheel
when you're a driver but you don't usu-
ally hit the dashboard if you're a pas-
senger,'' says Kennerly Digges, who
teaches automotive safety at George
Washington University. ''A passenger-
side air bag is nice to have, but it's not
as important as a driver's air bag.' By
1998 all new cars will have both driver's
and passenger's air bags, All new light
trucks will have both bags by 1999.
Padding is a less obvious but no less
important safety feature. The 1994 In-
finiti Q45, for example, has a thickly
padded dashboard and head liner, plus
padding above the doors, on the doors
and on the door posts, Even the sun vi-
sors are padded and locked into place.
SOme manufacturers have cut the num-
ber of dials and knobs sticking out of
the dashboard. The Saab 900S has a
flattened dash, which makes the car

Vitamins with clout
Vitamins, organic substances that are es-
sential for normal metabolism and
growth, help regulate protective chemical
reactions in the body, Scientists have long
known that these compounds prevent de-
ficiency diseases such as scurvy, rickets,
beriberi, pellagra and night blindness,
which are virtually unknown in the U.S.
today because of improved diet and forti-
fied foods, But over the years, a variety of
nutrients have been touted by health au-
thorities and vitamin faddists alike to
have quasi-miraculous powers against
other ailments. The most popular asser-
tions are that vitamin C quashes colds; vi-
tamin B6 allays the symptoms of PMS; and
vitamin E counters infertility in women.
Though studies failed to prove such
claims definitively, health-conscious
Americans boosted supplement sales to
$3 billion in 1990, more than doubling
revenues since 1976. And now, it turns out,
the boomers' faith in vitamins as vanguards
of preventive medicine may be justified.
Consider some recent studies:
The antioxidant compounds Vitamins C
and E and beta carotene (a compound,
plentiful in dark-green and orange
vegetables, that the body can convert into
vitamin A) have been shown to provide the
most pronounced benefits by counteracting
unstable molecule particles called free radi-
cals, These chemicals, which are produced
by the body and also formed in the envi-
ronment, can damage cells and promote
heart disease, cancer and other disorders.
Antioxidants may help prevent heart
disease-the nation's leading killer-by
inhibiting LDIL (low-density lipoprotein,
or ''bad'' cholesterol) from oxidizing
and forming fatty deposits on artery
walls, notes Ishwarlal Jialal, M.D.,
co-director of the Lipid Clinic at the
University of Texas Southwestern Medi-
cal Center, in Dallas.
In an ongoing Harvard Medical School
study, male doctors with heart conditions
who took 50 mg of beta carotene every
other day had fewer heart attacks, strokes,
and deaths related to heart disease than
those who did not. Charles Hennekens,
M.D., professor of preventive medicine at
Harvard Medical School, found, too, that
elderly people who ate vegetables high in
beta carotene had a lower risk of dying
from heart disease and that women who
consumed beta carotene- and vitamin
E-rich diets (and/or took supplements of
these nutrients) had 22 percent fewer car-
diovascular problems.
According to Gladys Block, Ph.D., an
epidemiologist at the University of
California at Berkeley, a summary of more
than ninety studies suggests that high vi-
tamin C intake significantly reduces the
risk of cancers of the oral cavity, esopha-
gus, stomach and cervix. (continued)

attained the rank of sergeant-and cap-
tured the hearts of his German hosts. Says

Affer SOITI0OTIe swiped her Saab fom a New ork Cty
street, Anne Howard scanned the classified ads for something
good, cheap and used to replace it. Three days later, she bought a
1982 Volkswagen Rabbit. 'It had a little rust,' she recalls, 'and the
engine didn't sound terrific, but t was cheap and drivable'' For a few
hours, at least The morning after registering her car, Howard set
out on a 200mile drive. When she stopped for coffee, the Rabbit
stopped for good. And she was hundreds of dollars in the hole.
The thought of buying yet another car filled her with dread. She's
not alone. Recent research by autoindustry consultant JD. Power
and Associates shows that women prefer having their teeth drilled
to shopping for a car.
It doesn't have to be that way. Suying a used car is always a
gamble, but knowing the rules of the game can help stack the
odds in your favor, Rule one: Take time to shop around. Rule two:
you're shopping new- or used-car lots, look for wellestablished
dealers with reputations to protect.
But before you hit the streets, do some homework. Check your
local library for Consumer Reports magazine's latest April issue,
devoted completely to cars. ts 'frequency of repair'' data on various
makes and models can steer you clear of clunkers. To determine
the fair market value of a car, check the National Automobile Deal-
ers Association (NADA) Official Used Car Guide, also known as 'the
blue book,' available in the reference section of most libraries and in
some banks. Some affiliate clubs of the American Automobile Asso-
ciation will also quote members the price over the phone.
Once you've narrowed down your options, choose a clear day and
close friend for your car hunt. You'll need both to look for nicks and
listen for knocks. Some red lights to watch for:
ELECTRICAL BREAxboWN Test all the switches by having your friend
stand outside to confirm that signals and ights are working proper-
ly. Electrical problems can mean costly repair work.
HOLESNTHE DASHBOARD These could be a sign you're in an old cab or
police car that had equipment mounted on the dash. (Bullet holes
are another telltale sign.)A tough past may preclude a long future.
RAWPANT RUST Wheel wells, rocker panels (under doors) and door
edges are most vulnerable to damage. Look for flaking paint, often a
sign of underlying rust A ittle shouldn't concern you, but f rust has
eaten through the trunk or interior floor, lethal fumes can enter the car.
Bue swosE Take the car out for a test drive, get t up to highway
speed, then take your foot off the accelerator for a few seconds. f
you spot blue smoke billowing from the exhaust, the car is burning
oil. Major engine repairs ahead.
aeNrsooy Drive through a puddle, then check the tire tracks left by
the wet wheels (or ask a friend to watch from behind). The rear tires
should directly follow the tracks of the front tires. f they don't, the
body or frame has been bent. Don't buy it.

Roush, her probation officer. She then
wired the money back to her bank in
Berkeley. ''These people just never
knew there were no such things as
CDs backed by the Federal Reserve,'
says Roush. ''Moreover, most of her
victims ignored their instincts. For
example, maybe a check was late, but
then it arrived with an explanation of

Don't do business with anyone
who won't tell you exactly how
and how much helshe is paid.
Think about whether you want to
pay for the planners services with a
flat fee or a combination of fee and
commission. Some planners receive
only fees for their services. These
''fee-only'' planners are arguably the
most objective: They will earn the
same amount of money no matter
which product you buy.
''When you hire a fee-only planner,
he or she is a fiduciary to you and
you stand on much firmer ground if
something goes wrong,' says Hoog-
stra, ''When you pay a commission
you have to understand that the plan-
ner works for the people who pay the
commission and that you're purchas-
ing a product. bn the eyes of the law
youre an equal. Its very much a case
of caveat emptor''
Some planners charge a fee for
their services but offset the fee with
commissions. IIn other words, if your
financial-planning bill is $2,500 and
the planner earns a $500 commission
on mutual funds he sells you, you
would pay only $2,000. These are
''fee-offset'' or ''fee-based'' planners.
Many fine planners use this system,
but it does make it a little more diffi-
cult for you to be sure youre getting
unbiased advice at a fair cost.
The National Association of Per-
sonal Financial Advisors (NAPEA) is
made up of fee-only planners. Still,
this does not necessarily mean it is
the best place to go for one. NAPFA
does not require its members to
undergo any type of testing or certi-
fication, although they must meet
some education requirements and
have at least three years of experi-
ence. Says Evensky: ''I would never
use NAPFA membership as the sole
standard for competence''
Be especially wary of stockbrokers
and insurance salespeople who call
themselves financial consultants.
They have a vested interest in selling
stocks or insurance for which they
collect a commission.
Says AARPh Hoogstra: ''You need
to say, I must know the ongoing cost
of working with you. Otherwise I'll
go elsewhere''
Put together a list of eight to ten
planners in your area whho have
specialized training.
You will probably want to include
someone with the CFP designation.
But that alone is not enough. Start
with these sources: your accountant,
attorney, The Institute of Certified
Financial Planners (800-282-PLAN),
the International Association for
Financial Planning (800-945-IAFP),
and the American Institute of Certi-
fied Public Accountants (800-TOA-
ICPA). Ask the latter for names in
your area of certified public accoun-
tants with the personal financial spe-
cialist (PFS) designation.
The PFS designation is a fairly
new one; only about 700 planners
have it, says Stuart Kessler, a partner
at Goldstein, Golub, Kessler & Co. in
New York City and chairman of
AICPAh Personal Financial Planning
Executive Committee. According to
IBCFP about 4,000 CPAs have the
CFP designation.

cycled''and ''degradable''?
To evaluate environmental claims,
look for product labels with specific
information about the product or its
packaging. For example, if a label
says recycled, check how much of the
product or packaging is recycled.
A growing number of labels on
recycled products tell where the recy-
cled material comes from. Post-Con-
sumer material comes from previous-
ly used business and consumer
products such as newspapers, plastic
bottles, glass containers and alu-
minum cans. Pre-Consumer material,
in contrast, is basically manufacturing
waste. For example, an envelope man-
ufacturer might take the clippings left
over when envelopes are cut from
paper and recycle them into other
paper products.
Recyclable on the label means the
item can be collected and made into
useful products. This is relevant to
you, however, only if the material is
collected for recycling in your com-
munity. Contact your local recycling
office, trash-collection company or
scrap dealer for this information.
Biodegradable materials like food
and leaves, when exposed to air,
moisture, and bacteria or other organ-
isms, break down and decompose into
elements found in nature. Pho-

Either way, degradation of any

IAN DAWSON
The F1's user friendliness is evident within moments of
climbing in and swinging down those big, modified gull-
wing doors, With three aboard-Palmer in the unique cen-
tral driving seat, your humble scribbler, and photo snapper
lan Dawson in the identically reclined buckets just behind
and to either side of him-there's none of that traditional
supercar claustrophobia. It's fairly tight on either side of
the passenger's arms and elbows, but driver movement is
uninhibited, head and leg room are generous for all, the
seats hug with reassuring lateral support, the view ahead
is panoramic, and yes, the driver really can see what's
happening directly behind or over his shoulder.
Palmer engages first, second-then sith. This, a four-
miles-a-minute gear, pulls with civility from i5 mph. If
you're feeling lazy, that makes the useable rev range 7000
rpm. R you're not, keep the powerplant simmering above
3500 rpm, where it begins to get serious, At low to medium
revs, the BMW V-12 is inexplicably similar, hissing and
nasal, to Porsche's endearing flat-si, but from there on up,
its note becomes deep and sharp and bass-heavy with au-
thority, the turboprop whine passing into an urgent howl.
When asked to make this transformation, the V-12 does
so immediately. No throttle lag before the mid-range, no
manic rush beyond it. Acceleration, though astonishing, is
fluid, progressive, and useable with accuracy. On the road,
this makes for speed with safety. On the twists of the
track, it keeps the car's line true and precise. Palmer turns
in toward the apex, holds the steering still, then balances
the car, exquisitely, with adjustments of the throttle. Slight
understeer on entry, the beginnings of a four-wheel-drift
at mid-point, darty little flicks of the steering wheel back
toward the straight-ahead position (but rarely beyond)
powering out. You'd only get the tail to wag on a dry road
through brutal inputs of power and steering in second or
third gears,
Palmer smiles again: ''Balancing the throttle in this car,
getting the whole thing to dance exactly as you want it to,
is child's play. You couldn't do this with a Bugatti, or
XJ220, or F40-you just don't get that lovely progression,
that controllability, with a turbo engine,''
There's talk of dialing out some of the F1's initial under-
steer, but it would be fine-tuning. As Murray says: ''We're
happy with the handling; it's very nearly sorted. The ride is
the one thing we've really got to work on; we're only about
75 percent of the way there. But we'll soon be going into
three months' intensive work on damping.''
The F1 is conspicuously firm and joggling at low road
speeds, but it's still a development mule. As McLaren Inter-
national boss Ron Dennis points out: ''You're the first to
get anywhere near the car, because we wouldn't want to
expose it to customers yet. Being a prototype, it doesn't
represent the quality they'll get,'' Which means customers
can rest easy: Apart from its dynamic superiority, the pro-
totype's build quality and attention to detail, inside and out,
already put other supercars to shame. --Phillp Bingham
the same size as the OE tire is no prob- ]
lem. But many drivers looking for bet- ]
ter handling choose wider, lower-pro- ]
file tires. Here, it's easy to get into ]
trouble if you're not careful.
On most cars, you can't use tires ]
more than an inch or two wider than ]
OE without clearance problems. As ]
Edmonds notes, 'Some vehicles are ]
able to accept an extreme increase in ]
width, while others can accept very lit- ]
tle,'' Bob Devour, national sales man- ]
ager for Centerline Wheels, advises to
turn the front wheels to full lock in
both directions to see how much clear-
ance there is between the tire and
fenderwell, as well as any nearby sus-
pension components. Take measure-
ments, if you can. Also, check the clear-
ance between the wheel and brake
caliper. Knowing how much room
youre working with will help you de-
termine how much wider the tires can
be without creating problems.
Indiscriminately mounting either
wider or lower-profile tires can not on-
ly cause clearance problems, it can
make your car handle worse, changing
ground clearance and altering suspen-
sion geometry. If the tire diameter is
changed in the process, it can also
throw off calibrations for the
speedometer, anti-lock braking system,
and other computer-controlled systems
that sense vehicle speed or distance.
That's why for virtually all street ap-
plications, your new tires should be

To April Tripp, an older worker is anyone 40
or over. But then, she's only 25.
As a manager at Enrich International, a
marketer of herbal and beauty products, in
Orem, Utah, Tripp supervises 30 people;
usually four or five are in the ''older''
category. ''It ean be a little diffieult when I
am the same age as [an employee's] youngest
ehild,'' she says.
Any young supervisor could be mindful of
these observations about older workers:
Don't be afraid to hire them. ''As long as
you treat them fairly with the other employ-
ees and don'tshow them any more or any less
deference than you show anyone else, it can
be a real productive experience,'' Tripp says.
Regard older workers as a valuable
resource, They offer experience and special
qualities, says Joan Kelly of the American
Association of Retired Persons.
Don't be intimidated. Some older work-
ers think their age qualifies them for higher
pay,Tripp has found, but she's firm about not
hvoring any age group with higher pay.
Deal with resentment tactfully. Some-
imes an older worker resents a younger
ooss, A tactie that has worked for Tripp is to
put the employee in charge of a special
oroject, which often makes the worker too
ousy to be resentful. -Sharon Nelton

reverse when they get the lender's ap-
praised-value report.
After the real-estate bubble burst in
the late 1980s, appraisers were accused of
overstating home values. ''Now they may
be going too far in the other direction,''
says Paul Havemann, president of HSH,
of Butler, N.J., a publisher of mortgage-
based financial figures. He calls it the
''equity trap.''
If you get stuck in this trap, with an
appraisal that doesn't show enough equity
in your home to cover the amount of the
loan, there are things you can do.
Douglas Brown, president-elect of the
Appraisal Institute, an association of pro-
fessional appraisers, notes that ''the law
says the lender must give you a copy of
the appraisal if you ask for it.'' He adds,
''Make sure that they give you the full
report, notjust the government-approved
cover page.'' You need all the extra notes
that show what the appraiser believes are
attractions and drawbacks.
You also want to see which recent home
sales were used as ''comparables'' for your
home's value estimate. ''It's quite possi-
ble,'' Brown says, ''that a nearby home
sold for a higher price after the appraiser
worked on your report.''
Orthe appraiser may not be sufficiently
familiar with your neighborhood and may
have misjudged ''comparables'' in an adja-
cent area of lower-quality homes.
It's also possible that a home that was
used in the comparables column was a
''distress'' sale. Someone may have lost a
job, or there may have been a divorce
requiring a quick transaction.
Armed with new facts and figures, you
should call the appraiser and ask for an
appointment to go over the report, item
by item.
The lender may increase the equity
figure for your home so you can qualify for
the loan, Ifthe appraiser won't budge and
you feel you have been wronged, you can
ask the lender to send out another ap-
praiser to provide a second opinion.
You'llhave to pay another appraisal fee,
but if you get the loan at the interest rate
you want, it could be worth it.

UT EVEN BREEDING PROGRAMS attract the wrath of zoo crit-
ics. ''You cannot have a viable captive population without
( breeding a surplus,'' says Don Lindburg of San Diego.
j ''The population is healthier genetically if it has many
A 6unders, each contributing only two or three offspring to
future generations. You often end up with animals that have met this
goal while they are still quite young but must be maintained until they
die many years later.''
What is to be done with these surplus animals? ''You start euthan-
izing surplus orangutans or gorillas and your zoo is going to be shut
down in a week,'' says Lindburg.
Some zoos sell their surplus animals to dealers, who sell them to
other zoos and sometimes to hunting camps. Hunters pay to shoot
exotic species. Control of the animals' use after they are sold to dealers
is difficult, and criticism mounts.
Naturalist George Schaller of the New York Zoological Society sug-
gests: ''Zoos will have to use contraceptives more often.'' Many zoos
also perform vasectomies on animals.
Breeding often requires moving animals about-sometimes unset-
tling to them and to the public as well. When Timmy, a 33-year-old
silverback gorilla in the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo, was scheduled to
be moved to the Bronx Zoo to mate with females there, Timmy's fans
in Cleveland hit the roof. Animal-rights groups went to court, claim-
ing that it would be cruel to separate him from Kribi Kate, his female
companion.
But Kribi Kate was barren. Moreover, zoo officials countered that
gorillas are not monogamous, and that in the wild a band's dominant

''It's beginning to turn around,'' he said.

i What is the role of chemistry in sex-
ual desirel
Many people feel that love is the source
of sexual desire. For them, ''chemistry''
only counts insofar as it helps create
love. But many of us have been wildly
attracted to someone we knew was com-
pletely ill-suited to us--or to someone
we didn't even like.
Chemistry is primal, in contrast to the
more rational thinking that goes into
choosing a mate. It can be traced, in part,
to pheromones, bodily secretions that
provide a chemical form of communica-
tion between living things (pheromones
may be the reason wormen who spend a
lot of time together often menstruate on
similar schedules). Things are going on
between our bodies that we couldn't pos-
sibly be aware of-which is why there is
no explaining why we are ''chemically''
attracted to certain people. Who can ar-
gue with something that lets us get out of
our heads for a while and focus only on
our bodies-fully experience the mo-
ment, appreciate the perfection of our
bodies, feel like a teenager again!

could use a financial structure. What
she probably doesn't need is a financial
planner. With typical minimum costs of
$2,000 for a comprehensive plan, most
planners are beyond the budgets and re-
quirements of those of us who earn
wages, pay bills, and don't have invest-
ment trust funds to look after.
For someone like Marie, ''a compre-
hensive financial plan might even be
overkill,'' suggests David Drucker, a Be-
thesda, Maryland-based financial plan-
ner. A better idea, he says: ''Hire a
planner for a quick consultation and
pick his or her brain for an hour or two
just to get started.''
Marie, however, decided to take mat-
tined to become ice cream, pies and
cobblers, one should administer a
compassionate dose of honey, brown
Sugar or bourbon. For delicacies like
the puree of peaches that form the
basis of Italy's champagne cocktail,
the Bellini, a dash of sugar is in
Order.
I also came to understand that the
sweetness of a peach is a balancing
act between bitter and nectar, be-
tween the tickling fuzz, the delicacy
of the skin, the lushness of the pulp
and the danger of the pit.
Though the peach was thought for
centuries to have originated in
Persia, hence its botanical name,
Prunus persica, botanists are now
certain that as early as the fifth
century B.C., the peach was cultivat-
ed in China, where it is called Tao, a
symbol of life, immortality and
death.
Beneath the sweet, giving flesh,
there is, inevitably, the pit. (That's
life!) A cyanide compound, it's what
gives the peach its almond tone,
what makes it a bittersweet conun-
drum.
In the case of clingstone peaches,
the pit clutches the fruit in a most
unliberated fashion, and it is there-
fore better suited for industrial
canning than home cooking. Free-
stone peaches, on the other hand,
fall gratefully from their stones. If
purchased from a farm stand or
specialty producer, and allowed to
ripen at room temperature, they
are sublime eaten plain, served
with prosciutto or steeped in vin-
egar as a condiment for rich meats.
Sight and smell are the most in-
fallible guides to buying peaches. In
other words, don't buy a peach that
doesn't smell like a peach, and don't
buy a hard, unyielding peach that
looks green beneath its bionic
blush.
Once you have picked well, you are
then ready for one of life's peak
experiences, according to Brillat-Sa-
varin in ''The Physiology of Taste.''
The initial taste, he wrote, induces
the eater to continue, to chew his
juicy mouthful. But the peach does
not truly reveal its perfume until
fully swallowed. Only then, writes
the 19th-century philosopher, will
the taster stop and say to himself,
''How delicious.''

Exports: U.S. firms face
dumping claims abroad
TEEGEEE
ment has launched more than 320 probes
into charges that foreigners are hurting U.S.
industry by pricing their products too low.
When it decides they have, Washington
punishes the foreigners by laying on extra
duties, raising the U.S. prices of products
from Chinese sodium thiosulfate to New
Zealand kiwi fruit and Norwegian salmon.
But if Americans think that foreigners
aren't trading fairly, the feeling is recipro-
cated. In an increasing number of cases, it's
foreigners who complain about dumping--
and U.S. exporters who are under attack.
Says Jan Woznowski of the General Agree-
ment on Tariffs and Trade: ''This is clearly a
new tendency... this trend will grow.''
Last week the trend hit U.S. steelmakers
broadside. On Tuesday, a federal ruling
found that parts of the U.S. industry had
been injured by cheap imports, clearing the
way for stiff anti-dumping duties on select-
ed steel products from 16 countries, includ-
ing Canada. But on Thursday, the U.S. in-
dustry's crusade against foreign unfairness
skidded to an embarrassed halt. A Canadi-
an tribunal declared that LTV. Worthing-
ton Steel and other U.S. companies are
dumping their steel north of the border.
That ruling will cost jobs in the depressed
Monongahela Valley near Pittsburgh: USX
Corp.'s Irvin Works faces an extra 18.6 per-
cent duty on every ton it ships to Canada.
Ash act: Canada's is only the latest case
in which foreigners have turned the tables
by accusing U.S. business of trading unfair-
ly. India created an antidumping bureau-
cracy last year, and promptly assessed
$63.54 on each ton of American-made poly-
vinyl chloride, which is used to make plas-
tic films and pipes. 3M must pay an extra 20
percent anti-dumping duty on telephone
connectors in Mexico. Belgian chemical gi-
ant Solvay wants the European Community
to put anti-dumping duties on American
soda ash, a key ingredient in glass-al-
though three big U.S. soda-ash producers
are owned by EC companies, one of them
by Solvay itself.
Paradoxically, the spread of anti-dump-
ing actions is a result of the opening of
world trade. As countries like Colombia
and South Korea lower tariffs and eliminate
quotas, import licenses and other barriers,
local industries may be overwhelmed by
imports. Antidumping investigations can
be a convenient political tool, allowing a
government to demonstrate that it will pro-
tect businesses and workers from ''unfair''
foreign competition. Although most econo-
mists consider dumping benign because it
lowers prices for consumers, governments
are more likely to judge that a high-profile
probe covering one industry will stave off
pressure to protect other industries. ''It's a
good sign,not a bad sign, as ittends to mean
they're opening their markets,'' says Wash-
ington trade lawyer Terence Stewart.
The political motives behind anti-dump-
ing laws are visible in Mexico, where small
businesses complain bitterly that high in-
terest rates and low import barriers have
left them unable to compete with goods
from Asia. To deflect the criticism, the gov-
ernment launched a sweeping inquiry in
April into whether China is dumping prod-
ucts like toys and clothes on the Mexican
market. While they investigate, Mexican
authorities are requiring Chinese shoe ex-
porters to pay a provisional duty of 1,105
percent-1I times the value of the shoes.
Beer spat: When U.S. exporters face
such complaints, they often contend that
foreign proceedings are slanted to protect
local firms-precisely the complaint im-
porters voice about the American anti-
dumping law. G. Heileman Brewing Co.
was hit with duties after Canada found its
Seattle brewery to be dumping Rainier beer
in British Columbia. Is it possible to dump
in just one province? Canadian authorities
say it is, Washington wants GATT to over-
turn the ruling, arguing that Canada should
consider prices nationwide. While legal
proceedings continue, the higher prices
U.S, brewers must charge have decimated
their 10 percent share of the B.C. market.
Says Heileman general counsel Randy
Smith: ''I don't think we have even 1 per-
cent right now.''
Congress, sensitive to business and labor
complaints about imports, has opposed ef-
forts to put new limits on anti-dumping
laws. But that tune may change now that
antidumping laws are costing jobs, not just
protecting them. Consider Monsanto. In
1991, the European Community found it
guilty of dumping U.S.made sweetener
and tacked on a duty of nearly $13 a pound.
''Our main competitor does not operate
with such a duty leveled against it,'' says
a company spokesman. Soon, Monsanto
won't, either. It will cut exports and open a
NutraSweet plant in France next month.

of the libretto) moved the story from the
470B.C. Persian courttoan Englishcountry
house of Handel's time.
Unfortunately, all that, including'Thomas
Lynch's delightful set, was not enough to
ensure ''Xerxes'' a permanent spot in the
current Handel renaissance. For starters,
von Stade got sick and missed the first per-
formances (though she is expected back this
week, for the remainder of the run, which
ends on Aug. 25). Her replacement was
Katherine Ciesinski, who acted withjustthe
right arrogance but sang colorlessly. With
the exception of Asawa, who gave Arsa-
mene real bite, none of the cast sang in
absolute Handelian style. (Nonetheless,
Upshaw was superb.)
The heart of the problem is the opera
itself, which is not to say it doesn't deserve a
hearing (second-drawer Handel is prefera-
ble to a lot of top-ofthe-line pieces from
lesser mortals). In breaking out of his usual
mold-a rigid structure comprising mainly
stand-up-and-sing numbers, many with or-
nate, lengthy repeats-the composer cheat-
ed himself. There's a lot more ''action''
and some comic moments to savor, but the
score doesn't begin to approach that of such
masterpieces as ''Julius Caesar'' and ''Ario-
dante.'' Handel was, above all, a glorious
melodymaker. If he were alive, says Brit-
ish early-music specialist Trevor Pinnock,
''he'd probably have three hit musicals
playing simultaneously.'' (Thus sparing us,
perhaps, another Andrew ILloyd Weber
show.) At Santa Fe, ''Xerxes'' is engaging
theater. If the music comes up short-well,
even when his melodic genius seems rela-
tively undernourished, Handel is welcome.

Though the lake offered fine fishing;
we headed for the Spey River, a main

clear that water appearing knee-deep
would turn out to reach chest level.
Holes were a watercolor wash of pale
green. The Spey trout bordered on the
cavalier. For example, a rainbow Judy
had on snagged itself between two
rocks. Trying to free it, Marc was fi-
nally forced to move in with his prob-
ing net handle.
''I can't believe it,'' he called. ''I'm
poking all around, and this fish is just
sitting there looking at me.'' The trout
casually waited until the leader was
freed, then squirted away and broke
the roughened tippet.

it a delicacy tasting somewhat like
peanut butter. I did not sample it. Too
devastating a bait, it is now forbidden.
Local anglers asked Marc if he could
tie a huhu imitation. He needed a
model to work from. Soon a bag
seething with live huhus arrived.
Marc was inspired (Gillian was not),

been avoided by doing a little cleanup be-
fore minimizing FoxPro.
The way to accomplish this is by pro-
viding a button in the application that
minimizes all of FoxPro, but only after the
cleanup is done. You click on this button
instead of using the minimize arrow in the
upper-right-hand corner of the FoxPro
window. This function, which would be
used as your buttons VALID clause, was
suggested on FoxForum by Lou McDon-
ald. It takes advantage of the undocu-
mented Screen option of the Zoom Win-
dow command which minimizes the
FoxPro screen. He used the FoxPro Flush
command as our cleanup code; you could
add additional statements as needed.

flush
...other cleanup code.,.
zoOm window screen min
*end function Iconize
There's another way to accomplish
the same result, and I'll present it here
ecause it hints at the versatility of the
Keyboard command, which stuffs the
keyboard buffer:
nctuon Iconize
flush
Keyhoard '(Alt-F) (1eftarrow)n'
nd function Iconize
This function works by opening up the
control menu in the FoxPro window and
then issuing the n command to cause the
window to minimize. You would nor-
mally open the control menu from the
keyboard by typing Alt-space, but since
you can't get this keystroke combination
through the Keyboard command, you in-
stead have to issue an Alt-F command,
which opens the FoxPro File menu. Then,
since the File menu is the first item, you
go left one position to open the control
menu.
Admittedly this method is a kludge,
and it won't work when the system menu
isn't active or if an application has
changed the system menu so that the File
menu isn't first, But it shows how you can
get around some of FoxPro's limitations
by judicious use of the Keyboard com-
mand.
MAYBE YES, AYBE M0 Despite its pow-
erful interface functions, FoxPro lacks an
easy way to retrieve a YeslNo response
from the user. The following function
pops up awindow, beeps the speaker, and
waits for the user to type a Y for Yes or
anything else for No. The function re-
home 5 o'clock in the morning, no
questions asked. No ''Where were
you?'' But ifI get home an hour late...
Saturday night,I went to play pool.
All my friends always come to my
house before we leave, so my mother
sees who I'm with. If I'm going to be
at someone's house, she wants the
number, where, who's this person?
When we were leaving the pool
hall,I called: ''Ma, we're going to go
to the diner and go eat.''I didn't have
to call, but ifI didn't, she'd be like,
''Where were you? What did you do?
How many hours could you be in a
pool hall?'' Then, when I got to the
diner,I called her, because I know she
worries. Before I left,I called again:
''T'm coming home now.''
With my brothers, my parents say,
''Oh, they're boys. It doesn't matter.''
But that's wrong. It's not fair.
If the wisecracking I6-year-old
narrator of ''Right by My Side'' envies
anyone-the rich white kids in his
school, for example-he 'd rather die
than let you know it, Or see what
hhe's feeling. This is a marvelous
coming-of-age novel by David Haynes
(New Rivers Press, $9.95).

iogether. When they first met, in
1959, he was a young reporter with
the Dallas Mlorning Neus, and she
had just arrived in town to start work
ae a junior-high English ieacher. As
Kate recalls,''I was moving into my
aparlment house, and ,]im [her new
neighbor] oflered to carry my books
up the stairs,'' Nine months later, he
carried her across the threshold.
Today, books continue to be the
ties that bbind. In May, Jim, 59, and
Nate, 53, embarked on a nine-city
lour to promote his seventh novel,
Blue Hearts,a caper about an aging
epy, and her second, WVhw-n Th-y
Tbok Awavthe lan in the Moon,a
tender story of family life in lexas,
(Both have received glowing re-

the band asked if we would license them
the name so they could tour. [udy and I
said, ''Go for it''; we get a small percent-
age of the take. I go out and play the
harp sometimes. We do Soul Man and
Knock on Wood. We rip the house apart.
PLAYBOY: How do you rate your musical
abilities?
avkRROYD: I'm a great emcee-front man
and I can move onstage. It's funny and
exciting to see a man of two hundred-
plus pounds moving in such a way that it
looks like he knows reasonably well
where he's going and he's not going to
hurt people.
PLAYBOY: What are your musical tastes
these days?
avkROYD: I listen a lot. My favorites are
the Black Crowes, Robert Cray, Bonnie
Raitt, Stevie Ray and [immy Vaughan,
Kim Wilson and the Thunderbirds,
There's also a new band called Blues
TYaveler with an amazing new young
harmonica player named John Popper
PLAYBOY: Might there be another Blues
Brothers movie?
aYkROYD: I'm working on a story with
[ohn Landis, who directed the original.
We're going to try to bring back every-
body from the first movie. We have to
convince the studio. The walls of Univer-
sal are still stained from the first Blues
Brothers movie.
PLAYBOY: Stained? Didn't Universal
make money on that?
aYkREooYD: Not really, because it cost so
much. They made their money back, but
it was traumatic getting the movie made.
It was an enormous production. [ohn
was out of control,
PLAYBOY: You've often been criticized for
creating movies with runaway budgets.
AYKROYD: We are always criticized for
costs-for 1941, Ghostbusters, Blues Broth-
ers-but that money doesn't go into the
pockets of the actors and directors, it
goes into the pockets of labor.
PLAYBOY: And special effects and
wrecked cars. ...
AYKROYD: The major expense of Blues
Brothers was not the seventy police cars
we bought from the Chicago Police De-
partment. We paid only $700 each for
them. The major expense was labor, so
that's good, it gets people working, and
why shouldn't the profits of the mega-
corporations be reinvested in the trades
of this industry? IfI write a big show and
it costs a lot of money, I make no apolo-
gies, I'd be a wealthier man today and a
better businessman if I sat down and
wrote small movies that cost little and
brought in lots.
PLuAYBOY: Will you continue to make se-
quels-whether based on the Blues
Brothers, Ghostbusters, Coneheads or
others?
aYkoYD: As long as there is something
new to do with them and it's enjoyable.
It's kind of nice to have built-in franchis-
es. The one I don't think we'll necessari-
ly further exploit is Ghostbusters. It looks
with you whatever you do. I think I
had to write all this down because
your letter was such a shock to me,
not a bad shock, more of a surprise.
The idea had just never come into
my head that the idea of raising a
family would ever come into your
head. So you can see, having never
thought about it, it was a true sur-
prise. No matter what happens I
love you lots and it will be a real trip
for both of us to see what I do with
my life....
Holly's letter forced me to admit that I
really didn't want to be a new daddy. Us
kids are a lifelong commitment. I realized
that I simply didn't want to make that
commitment. Orli and I loved each oth-
er, but we had different goals in life. De-
spite the bond between us, we would
have to go our separate ways.
That summer I worked at Winnarain-
bow, a camp for the performing arts run
by [ahanarah and Wavy Gravy. I was the
comedy counselor. At the end of the sea-
son I made love with another counselor
on the outdoor trampoline. The next
morning I noticed a stain on the tram-
poline from my semen. I found a piece
of chalk and drew an outline around the
stain. It was, after all, the corpse of Hol-
ly's sibling.
Holly had gone to visit a Greek island
and stayed there, working as a dishwash-
er and cleaning squid for a dollar an
hour, eight hours a day, seven days a
week. To take a bath she had to climb in-
to her kitchen sink. But now she was
back in London and planning to return
to America. She sent a photo taken in
one of those booths where she held up a
handwritten card with each of the four
poses, so that you could read this vertical
message in front of her smiling faces:
DEAR DAD SEND MONEY!
Six years later Holly was the manager
of community and government relations
at KQED, he PBS and NPR affiliates in
San Francisco. I was performing in town
and staying at her apartment. One day,
because it was raining hard and she trav-
eled by motor scooter, I was tempted to
call her at work and tell her that if the
ground was too slippery to drive on, I'd
be glad to pay for a cab. But Holly was
now 27 (old enough to spank), and I re-
alized that if I were in Venice and it were
raining in San Francisco, I wouldn't
phone her. So now, even if she were to
die because her motor scooter slid in the
rain and I would have to live with that
horror for the rest of my life, I still had
to let go of my paternalism and trust her
judgment. I decided not to call. When
Holly came home, I told her how I had
resolved my dilemma.
''Oh,'' she said casually, ''if it had been
raining too hard, I would have taken a
bus home.''
Over dinner we were talking about the
way you realize how dependent you are
on appliances only when the electricity
goes off.
''Speaking of appliances,' she 'said,
''do you ever use that microwave oven
Mom and I gave you last Christmas?''
''Yeah, once in a while, to heat up soup
and things. You know what, though, I
left the little door open and I found a
few mouse turds on the tray inside. If I
ever actually caught a mouse inside the
microwave, I'd try to shut the door be-
fore it could escape.''
''Dad, I can't believe you'd nuke a
mouse.''
''No, I'd never do that, I would just
unplug the microwave and carry it out-
side, and let the mouse go free.''
''And then you'd race it to see who
could get back to the house first.''
''And the mouse would win.''
(continued from tage 80)
in the storm. It came to me that Beauty,
too, must be somewhere in the middle of
those tamed hordes, and that fantasy
gave me new strength to wait.
By lunchtime we knew we were ship-
wrecked. The lines were interminable
outside the seven restaurants, the cafete-
rias, the packed bars, and in less than
three hours they all had to be closed be-
cause there was nothing left to eat or
drink, The children, who at that mo-
ment seemed to be all the children in the
world, started to cry at the same time,
and a herd smell began to rise from the
crowd. It was a time for instinct. In all
that scrambling, the only things I could
find to eat were the last two cups of
vanilla ice cream in a children's shop.
While the waiter put the chairs on the ta-
bles as the patrons left, I ate very slowly
at the counter, seeing myself in the mir-
ror with the last little cardboard cup and
the last little cardboard spoon, thinking
about Beauty.
The flight to New York, scheduled for
11 in the morning, left that night. By the
time I managed to board, the other first-
class passengers were already in their
seats and a flight attendant led me to
mine. My heart stopped. In the seat next
to mine, beside the window, Beauty was
taking possession of her space with the
mastery of an expert traveler. If I ever
wrote this, nobody would believe me, I
thought. And I stammered an indecisive
greeting that she did not hear.
She settled in as if she were going to
live there for many years, putting each
thing in its proper place and order until
her seat was arranged like the ideal
home where everything was within
reach. In the meantime, the steward
brought us the welcoming champagne. I
took a glass to offer to her but thought
better of it just in time. She wanted only
a glass of water, and she asked the stew-
ard, first in incomprehensible French
and then in an English only somewhat
more fluent, not to wake her for any rea-
son during the flight. Her warm, serious
voice was tinged with Oriental sadness.
When the steward brought her the
water, she placed a toiletries case with
copper corners, like a grandmother's
trunk, on her lap and took two golden
pills from a box that contained others of
various colors. She did everything in a
methodical, solemn way, as if nothing
unforeseen had happened to her since
her birth. At last she pulled down the
shade on the window, lowered the back
of her seat as far as it would go, covered
herself to the waist with a blanket with-
out taking off her shoes, put on a sleep-
ing mask, turned her back to me and
slept without a single pause, without a
sigh, without the slightest change in po-
sition, for the eight eternal hours and 12
''hure not even slowing me doum.''
4CEASE FIRING
an old military piece that harkens
back to time spent in the service.
When these individuals purchase a
firearm of historic value for the office
or den, they are most likely joining
the fastest-growing segment of the
collecting fraternity and entering
the world of the nonfiring replica gun
collector.
Not to be confused with toy guns,
nonfiring replicas are fabricated
mainly of a zinc-oxide alloy with pol-
ished hardwood grips or stocks. Ex-
cept to highly trained eyes, these
fakes can fool most people. They
have working actions, a familiar
weight and balance and a full comple-
ment of moving parts. They are, in
fact, authentie in every way except
one-they cannot be fired. All the
parts have been altered by roughly a
millimeter so they cannot chamber or
fire live ammunition.
It was during a trip to Japan 25
years ago that Thomas B. Nelson dis-
covered replica guns. Craftsmen
there were producing high-quality
replica firearms to satisfy collectors
hampered by the terms of occupation
following the second World War.
Even today, stringent laws in Japan
forbid personal ownership of authen-
tie handguns.
At the time of Nelson's trip in
1967, lawmakers in the United States
were pushing for stricter gun-control
laws, and Nelson, a noted authority
on small arms, determined that new
laws would restrict the availability
and transfer of real firearms. Re-
turning home, Nelson decided that
the time was right to start an import
business for replica guns. In relative-
ly short order, he became one of the
leading distributors of nonfiring guns
in the world. Today, Nelson not only
sells guns from his own catalog, the
Collector's Armoury, in Alexandria,
Virginia, but also supplies most of
the other catalog and mail-order
companies. Many of these replicas
not only come from Japan, but from
Italy and Spain as well.
Although replica guns are perfect
in every detail, they aren't deactivat-
ed originals nor are they made wis
original parts. As noted, the dimen-
sions have been altered by a millime-
ter or two, and this means that actual
gun parts cannot be interchanged
with a replica to make it capable of
firing live ammunition. As a further
precaution, a high-carbon steel rod is
integrally formed along the axis of
the bore, blocking the entire length
of the barrel. According to Nelson,
each replica his company handles
passes inspection by the Bureau of
Aleohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and
each receives a certificate stating
that it isn't a firearm.
Among the many advantages of
replica gun collecting is the ability to
own lookalike weapons that other-
wise are illegal to possess or require
cutting through extensive red tape.
One such popular piece is the
Thompson M1921 machine gun. The
replica version of the ''Chicago Type-
writer,' as it was called by gangsters
in the Roaring '20s, contains 59 parts,
including a vertical fore-grip and de-
tachable butt-stock and a 20-round
box magazine. It measures 35 in. long
and weighs 9 pounds, just like its
real counterpart. Also, it can be com-
pletely disassembled.
Another advantage of replica fire-
arms is priee. The lookalike Thomp-
son M1921 submachine gun sells for
less than $800. A real Thompson
machine gun would cost as much as
$8000, plus a $200 payment of a
Federal Transfer Tax.
Military buffs might be more in-
terested in the M1911 .45 automatic
pistol, a standard government Army-
issue sidearm that dates back to
1911. This familiar piece has seen
action in WWI, WWII, Korea and
Vietnam. Replicas are available for
roughly $100.
Police buffs might be more inter-
ested in the .44 Magnum revolver
made famous by Clint Eastwood in
the ''Dirty Harry'' movies. This model
features a 6-shot swing-out cylinder
in both single and double action. Cost
is about $90.
Like all products in the market-
place, replica guns are subject to the
whims of the public. During the
1960s and early 1970s, Western
quick-draw revolvers were tremen-
dously popular. During the mid-70s,
the pistol used by agent 007, James
Bond, a German Walther PPK, was a
big-selling replica model. Modern
military and assault weapons, like
the Russian AK-47 assault rifle and
Israeli Uzi submachine gun, were
popular in the 1980s, and now Civil
War firearms are hot.
While most of the firearms men-
tioned above are perennial favorites,
replicas are also made for fanciers
who wish to extend their collections
RepficasAnd3$e Law
4 Interestingly, recent gun-control legis-
lation has had little effect on the sale,
purchase or distribution of nonfiring repli-
ca firearms. However, under the terms
of the Federal Energy Management
lmprovement Act of 1988, replica gun
fanciers were not so lucky.
LUnder Part 1150 of Section 4, which
has become known as the Look-Alike
lLaw of 1988, it states that anything that
looks ike a gun manufactured after May
5, 1989 must conform to certain regula-
tions. For some models this means, 'A
blaze orange solid plug will be perma-
nently affixed to the muzzke end of the
barrel as an integral part of the entire
device and recessed no more than 6mm
from the muzzle end of the barrel.''
For toy cap pistols, noisemakers,
water guns, lightemitting guns, airgun
ejectile toys and lookalike firearms that
discharge such things as water, lght and
nonmetallic projectiles, blaze orange
rmarkings must be permanently affixed to
the exterior of the barrel, surrounding the
muzzle end for a depth of 8mm.

yefore you even ask, the answer is
no. No, you cannot buy the new
eeo-ec, DOHC, three-cylinder, in-
tercooled, turbocharged Mazda A2Z-1
in the United States, even if you could
afford its $14,000 sticker price. The
plastic-bodied, bumperless micro-rock-
et would never meet U.S. crash safety
requirements, and tweaking its 64-
horsepower engine to pass our emis-
sions standards would erode the AZ-1s
40-mpg rating. But that didn't stop us
from throwing the mid-engine coupe
into Manhattan traffic to judge the
ddapanese definition of an urban
assault vehicle.
City vehicles need to accelerate
quickly, stop quickly, and feature good
mirrors, The AZ-1 scored well in all
three departments. Acceleration off
stop lights was brilliant, especially
when the turbo kicked in with a
scream at around 3,000 rpm. Four-
wheel disc brakes quickly checked the
1,587-pound car's excess speed and
the mirrors gave an ample view of the
New York traffic around us. Steering
was nimble and sure. Japan-market
city cars are, in some ways, an urban
commuter's dream.
The A2Z-1 failed on two key points,
however. Potholes ingested its little
13-inch wheels and strained the four-
wheel independent suspension; also,
the car's cute appearance and gull-
wing doors drew crowds anywhere it
was parked. That suggests it would
also attract thieves.

reorganized its board and its top man-
agement structure.
GM executives have said that plat-
forms and powertrains will be reduced
to a manageable few, and every re-
maining car and truck product line is
under pressure to become profitable in
short order or suffer cancellation,
though no divisions will be shut down
or merged at this point. The automak-
er recently announced 14 immediate
model cancellations, however.
Thus, GMs overall product plans for
1994 include not a single new car, but
rather revolve around passive re-
straint systems, elimination of slow-
selling models, and engine consolida-
tion. GM will also be shuffling its
relationships with Japanese partners
Isuzu, Suzuki, and Toyota as Isuzu ex-
its the passenger car business, upset-
ting the Geo supply line.
xactly how this will shake out is
not yet clear, but GMs initial strat-
egy is to be aggressive with new
trucks, starting with the new S-10
compact series replacements this fall,
followed by the new S-10 Blazer in
1995 and then a new minivan. The lat-
ter, a replacement for the APV, merits
attention not because of its market po-
sition in a category rapidly becoming
dominated by Ford and Chrysler prod-
ucts, but because it represents a test
bed for composite technology. Although
GM is studying an all-steel minivan,

working out on cross-country ma-
chines (25 percent).
That doesn't quite measure up to
the Prevention Program's activity
plan, It advocates a full hour of ac-
tivity a day-30 minutes of aerobic
exercise, plus 20 minutes of resis-
tance training three times a week.
(Only 22 percent of our respondents
said they lifted weights before they
began the program.) The rest of the
hour should be filled with ''lifestyle
workouts''-like mowing the lawn,
Vacuuming or taking the stairs in-
stead of the elevator.
Diet Kudos to the 89 percent of our
respondents who said they try to eat
low-fat and nonfat foods! And con-
grats to the almost three-fourths
who make high-fiber foods, fish and
poultry (instead of meat), and low-
cholesterol foods a part of their di-
ets, But respondents were caught
lagging behind when it comes to eat-
ing their fruits and vegetables-only
54 percent said they try to eat at
least five servings of produce a day,
And only 52 percent reported
watching their sodium intake by
eating low-sodium foods, which
may help stave off high blood pres-
sure in some people.
Blood pressure Fully 86 percent of our
respondents reported blood pressure
levels less than 140/90. If your blood
pressure's higher than that, make sure
you're under a doctor's care, There's
a good chance that, if your blood
pressure is 130-139 over 85-89,
lifestyle changes like those advocated
by the Prevention Program may bring
your blood pressure down-tvithout
hypertensive drugs, (See ''Gentle
Remedies,'' July 1993.)
Smoking While 96 percent of our re-
spondents said they don't currently
smoke, almost half of them once
practiced the unhealthy habit, and
then quit. ''Smoking is thrombo-
genic-it causes blood clots that may
clog your arteries,'' Dr, Kottke says,
''But heart-disease risk from smoking
goes back to baseline about two years
after you stop the habit.''
Supplements More than half of our
respondents were taking multimin-
erallmultivitamins when theybegan
the Prevention Program, and about
40 percent were supplementing their
diets with vitamins C and E, so-called
antioxidants that preliminary re-
search has linked to lower risk of
heart disease and heart attack, Only
17 percent of our respondents were
taking supplements of beta-carotene,
another antioxidant.
Of course, supplements can't sub-
stitute for a healthy diet like the Pre-
vention Program eating plan. But the
evidence that they can help is get-
ting stronger all the time, For more

narian called her back to say that the
blood results were normal. But when
heheard about Berra'snew symptoms,
herecommended Donna consulta spe-
cialist-a veterinary neurologist.
Donna made the appointment
promptly, She was beginning to have a
few suspicions of her own as to a pos-
sible cause. Donna and Berra were con-
stant companions on long walks in
the New England woods, And along
with picturesque scenery, those re-
gions of New England are famous
for something less pretty: deer ticks
(now called black-legged ticks), the
carriers of Lyme disease.
So Donna brought Berra to a veteri-
naryneurologist. But Berra was feeling
good that particular day, She was
hardly limping at all. The veterinarian
could find no other typical symptoms
of Lyme disease: no fever, no swollen
wrist joints, no abnormalities in the
joint fluid. Still, there was that strange
jaw paralysisandthelethargy. Thefact
that it was winter also made Lyme dis-
ease less likely: The disease is usually
transmitted and diagnosed in the sum-
mer, So the doctor drew blood to test
for a variety of diseases. [ust to be on
the safe side,he ordered a test for ILyme
disease. And he sent Donna and Berra
home, again without treatment.
A few dayslater,Donna received the
long-awaited answer. The neurologist
called to say that Donna's instincts had
apparently been right: Berra's blood
test showed the presence of antibodies
the big tools. We began using
small tools instead to scrape
away the rock. AS soon as we
could see a bone, we coated
it with glue to make it stronger.
Soon we could see that the
skeleton was nearly 40 feet (12
m) long and was curled up on
its left side. Before we dug the
bones out of the ground, we
drew a map of where each
bone lay. We would need the
map later to study the way the
bones were buried. That
would help us figure out how
this dinosaur had died.
After finishing the map, we
began digging out the bones.
We dug around the bones so
a lot of rock and dirt stayed
attached to them. This way we
could be sure we got all of
the bones. And the extra rock
and dirt helped protect them.
Then we coated the bun-
dles with plaster. The plaster

their trip to the museum.
We still had another prob-
lem. The biggest fossil bun-

wandered around the house
u/ with the look of an injured
puppy, sometimes bursting into
tears, When her worried parents
questioned her, she would answer,
''Its nothing.'' How could she ex-
plain she was desperately in love for
the first time, and the object of her
adoration didn't even know she
existedi Finally her father sat
down, took her hand and tenderly
questioned her until he learned the
cause of her sadness, Gently, sim-
ply, he talked with her of life and
love. He comforted her. She was six
years old.
''['ve never forgotten that mo-
ment,' says Kathleen Kilpatrick, a
special assistant in the office of the
U.S. Secretary of the Interior,
''How often I've thought back and
wondered that he didn't just laugh
at me. Instead, he treated me with
dignity and concern for how deeply
I Rl.''
Robert Kilpatrick, now retired
board chairman of CIGNA Corp.,
never took a course in parenting.
He was simply showing love for
his daughter, giving her his time
and trying to see the world
through her eyes. It would be hard
to come up with a better formula
for fatherhood.
''Fathers bring a unique pres-
ence, a special strength to raising
Guarendis book shows that tradi-
tional values, rooted in the bedrock
of mutual trust, truth and uncondi-
tional love, are still the keys to
successful child-rearing. And in
this setting, fathers bring special
gifts to parenting.
Sometimes fatherly instincts
come easily;sometimes they have to
be cultivated. But their payoff in
lasting, positive effects on growing
children is enormous, Here, culled
from real-life experience, is what
kids need most from a dad:
Someone aho hoas his lote for
them. Kenneth Meade, pastor of the
Church of Christ at Manor Woods,
in Rockville, Md., says one of the
most frequently expressed desires
in his family counseling comes
from children saying, ''I wish Dad
would zell me or sshoaw he really
loves me.'' Time after time, clergy-
men, counselors and psychologists
encounter variations of this theme-
children, often grown men, longing
for more expressed affection from
their fathers, ''I never doubted my
fathers love,' writes author Walt
Harrington, ''but even today I cant
recall a time he hugged or kissed
me or said he loved me.''
Such overt expressions give
needed assurance and encourage-
ment. Motivational expert Zig Zig-
lar had this confirmed in reverse
one day when he was trying to
assemble a tricycle he had just
bought for his then-four-year-old
son, Tom. Ziglar became more ex-
asperated by the minute because
the proverbial bolt A was not fit-
ting into nut B. He was about to
give up when Tom, who was look-
ing on, suddenly blurted,''I sure do
love you, Dad!'' Needless to say,
Ziglar finished putting together
that tricycle.
Guarendi found that ''in strong
families, fathers who had problems
expressing affection made special
efforts to show it,'' Some who
couldn't say it wrote it in a letter,
card or note on the back of one of
their children's drawings. One fa-
ther, adept at composing music,
writes songs to his kids to tell them
he loves them.
Fathers might also consider a
technique used by a mother in
Utah. Knowing her children were
uncomfortable with public displays
of affection,she worked out a secret
code, known only to her kids,
When one of them was about to
participate in a sport or other school
activity, she would squeeze the
childs shoulder, meaning ''I love
you.''
An important ''surrogate'' way
for a father to convey affection to a
child is through the affection he

she is nearly go, ''T've never been
prejudiced in my life-and you
know it,''
We see the change in her attitude
begin with an ice storm that dis-
rupts power in Atlanta. After mak-
ing his way to her house over slick
roads, Hoke tells Daisy,''I figured
your stove was out.I know you gots
to have your coffee in the morn-
ing.'' At the end of the film, she
takes his hand and confesses,
''You're my best friend. You are,
you are.''
Driving Mia Dairy is now on
Vrietys list of all-time box-office
champs. Jessica Tandy won the Os-
car for Best Actress, Dan Aykroyd,
who played Daisy's son, and Mor-
gan Freeman were also nominated
for Oscars.
''When I was a kid,I wanted to
be a motie star,'' Freeman says.
''Somewhere along the way, I
started to think, 'No. Stardom is
nothing. I want to change people's
attitudes. I want to make movies
that mend us, I want to be a force
for healing.'
''I have a large stake in the future
that movies like Driving Mia Dairy
are helping to bring about.I tell my
children and grandchildren its will-
power that does things. All it takes is
one individual to say, ''This will
stop--or to start something good.''

him. Then he'll divorce me. She sees
herself banished to the city-supplant-
ed here by a Sherry or a Donna, a will-
ing breeder-single, childless, possessed
ofnothing.
George steps into the tub-one
pajamaed leg, then another-and curls
around her. 'Let me in,'' he says, snug-
gling, pulling the towel over both their
knees, ''I love you, you know.''
''I know.'' She presses her nose into
his neck, breathing the scent of fresh
I know where it's going if I don't aim
it there?''
''What I'm trying to tell you, Meg,
is you can't worry about that. You'll
figure that out when it gets there, if it
gets there.''
Meg frowns. This sounds like non-
sense to her. In other sports-basket-
ball, archery, skeet, hockey, she thinks,
listing them all in her mind-the target,
the goal, is the focal point. She imag-
ines a football field with no goal posts,
the players running amok, aimlessly
bumping into one another, their eyes
glued to the ball. ''But how can you be
sure it'll get in?'' she asks.
''Well, you can't! Even the pros
double-fault sometimes. But you sure as
hell can't guarantee it the way you're
doing it,'' He hands her another ball.
''Just try it. Have a little fih.''
Meg tosses the ball up high, higher
than she usually does, and swings her
racket back so far it touches her shoul-
der blades. Look at the ball, she tells
herself sternly, but already she feels
herself resisting. Reflexively, guiltily,
she focuses across the net, and watches
for what seems like minutes as the ball
falls wide and long.
*OH, MY GODI* DONNA HOLDS HER
fork in midair and stares at nothing.
A blob of chicken salad drops to the
tablecloth.
''What is it?''Meg asks.
Donna frowns, then smiles, her face
relaxing. 'Nothing. False alarm. I
thought my water broke.''
This time it's Meg who says, ''Oh,
my God.'' She feels a surge of annoy-
ance. Somehow, she suspects this is typ-
ical of Donna: blithely lunching out,
chancing delivery on a restaurant floor.
''Don't worry, it hasn't,'' Donna says.
Meg smiles primly. ''I guess, this
being your second time, you're taking it
pretty casually.''
''Well, Bobby is eight, after all. His
birth isn't exactly fresh in my memory.
But it is a relief not to have to go through
this one alone.'' Donna pats her belly.
''Russ has been carrying a beeper
around. He can't wait,''
''Where was Russ for Bobby's birh?''
Meg asks. (ontinued an page @4)
A first step might be to ask your
child why he thinks he's being teased.
You're not looking for deep psycho-
logical insight, but simply to understand
the dynamics of the situation so you
can suggest ways to disarm the teaser,
explains psychologist Myrna Shure,
Ph.D., of Hahnemann University in
Philadelphia. For one first-grade boy,
for example, who was being relentlessly
taunted by older kids about his glasses,
teasing back was the answer. The next
time the big kids called him ''goggle
eyes,'' he cupped his hands around his

O U T D OORS SOU T H
Ice Age
Orphans
We Southerners, accustomed to a
mild climate, don't readily relate to
tales of the Ice Age. Talk of Pleis-
tocene glaciers from millennia ago,
and we doze off. But give us a three-
hanky drama about orphans stranded
in the mountains and we perk up,
ready to pull on hiking boots and
charge to the rescue.
I know one pocket of biological
wonder where the two subjects curi-
ously merge. Cranberry Glades, a
spongy peat bog in the mountains of
southern West Virginia, reflects a fro-
zen past and harbors enough plant
species of that era to pass as a botan-
ical orphanage.
Most of the South's wetlands lie
along steamy coasts and lowland
rivers. This cool cousin huddles at
3,400 feet, among mountains more
than a thousand feet higher, which
trap cold air. The isolated valley-
especially 750 acres of open glades,
boggy forest, and dense alder thick-
ets--resembles arctic tundra typi-
cally found far to the north in Canada.
If the Ice Age was the train that
carried colonies of flora and fauna
south for a long vacation, Cranberry's
exotic residents are the stragglers
that missed the boarding call when
the cold pulled out. Had they not
Nashville warbler find their south-
ernmost breeding range here.
Cranberry Glades' beauty is sub-
tle. At first glance, the flat meadows
and low hummocks appear to be a
fairly mundane landscape nestled
among stands of red spruce, eastern
hemlock, yellow birch, and other
trees common to cool heights.
Bend down close, however, and
find surprises in the details. Tiny pink
orchids bloom in midsummer among
delicate cinnamon ferns. The name-
sake cranberry vines, their fingernail-
size flowers giving way to equally
small reddish fruit from summer to
fall, weave among sphagnum moss.
Carnivorous sundews, also squatting
low, wait patiently for flies to alight
fatally on their sticky faces. Only the
modest stalks of skunk cabbage,
sedge, and tufts of cotton grass gain
any height over the glades.
The entire menagerie grows on the
surface of wet, spongy peat moss
that varies greatly in depth. A person
could sink ankle deep in what looks
like a firm field. (To protect the
glades, the Forest Service requires
visitors to use a V:-mile boardwalk.)
I must admit, orchids and peat
moss did not first draw me, I origi-
nally went for outdoor adventure in
the surrounding 26,000-acre Cran-
berry Back Country and 35,864-acre
Cranberry Wilderness, also parts of
Monongahela National Forest. With
school friends, in every season and all
types of weather, I explored rugged
terrain along 100 miles of trails.
For day trips we rode knobby-tired
bikes into the backcountry or carried
fishing gear into the wilderness. For
longer outings we shouldered heavy
backpacks. Often we started from
trailheads along the Highlands Scenic
Highway, a ridge road lined with
spruce trees and providing magnifi-
cent views into Cranberry country.
One fall, after an early snow, we
set out to track black bear and hap-
pened upon woodchucks, hawks, wild
turkeys, and snowshoe hares as well.
In winters so deep we got a taste of
what the Ice Age must have been
like, we sipped piping hot coffee
while camped beside frozen forks of
the Cranberry or Williams Rivers.
With passing years I have mounted
wilderness treks less often, and lin-
gered more among the glades' hum-
ble plants. Perhaps it takes maturity
to appreciate those biological waifs,
fated by prehistoric coincidence to
exist in isolation. I still find it hard
to picture my Southern homeland
shivering for centuries, but I have
come to admire those sturdy species
that came south and - at least
here--managed to find a home.

i black-eyed peas are some of your
&l favorite foods, you're in good
company. But if you think those
down-home flavors might just be too
informal for your next fancy gather-
ing, think again.
After readers called us, requesting
a uniquely Southern reception menu,
we decided to give it a try. The result
is a feast of finger foods, appetizers,
and a beverage fit for even the finest
of parties.
For starters, we dressed uniquely
Southern foods in their Sunday best,
transforming black-eyed peas into a
tangy salsa, and using turnip greens
as the base for a hot, cheesy dip. The
salty tingle of country ham and the
straightforward taste of buttermilk in-
spired us further, so we've used
those flavors in a showy canape and
in pecan-studded chicken fingers. In
all the recipes in this menu, we kept
an eye out for ease of preparation,
too. Only one of the dishes-Shrimp-
and-Cucumber Uanapes -involves
piping using a pastry bag.
More than anything, this menu
captures the excitement of celebrat-
ing, so serve your Southern heritage
with pride. These recipes will show
you how.

4x 100-meter relay team. Cornerback
James Trapp, a third-round draft choice,
was an alternate on that same relay team.
And maybe there'll be Ismail, who can
hang with any of these guys.
It's a freakish team. ''There are lots of
fast football players,'' says Gault,''It's be-
come a speed game. But there's speed
and there's elite speed. As far as elite
speed, the league's got about a dozen
such players. We have half of them.''
This is not necessarily an advantage. Of
those six, only Gault and McDaniel have
made any kind of impact. But, as far as
Davis is concerned,speed is the way to go.
Growing up in Brooklyn, Davis was in-
trigued by both the Yankees and the
Dodgers, ''The Yankees had power, size,
and created fear,' he says,''The Dodgers
believed in speed and in development;
they were willing to take chances. For the
Raiders, I wanted both. I never could un-
derstand why you couldn't have both.''
Speed means big plays and sudden
strikes that demoralize opponents with
their swiftness. Having speed puts tre-
mendous pressure on defenses. Davis be-
lieves that his sprinters don't have to
catch the ball to be dangerous. Their pres-
ence is electric enough to alter a game's
dynamics, moving the defense off the line
and creating space for an offense.
''Speed,'' says Davis, ''is an integral part
of fear. As you know, we've always said
we'd rather be feared than respected.''
Davis was The Citadel's chief recruiter
in 1955, when he landed an All-America
sprinter out of Philadelphia named Ange-
lo Coia, Coia enjoyed a seven-year career
in the NFL and, not at all incidentally,
is now a scout for the Raiders. The bias of
the personnel department toward
speed--Kent McCloughan, a former
Raider cornerback, is another scout who
was a high school All-America in track-
is as natural as it is mandated. To this day,
part of a Raider scouting report is a work-
up on the player's high school track
experience.
This emphasis doesn't always pay off.
Bo Roberson was a silver medalist in the
1960 Games in the long jump, and al-
though Davis kept him on the Raiders for
four seasons, he is not remembered as
having been anything more than a ''com-
plement'' to the offense. Jimmy Hines,
one of those sensational sprinters that
came out of Texas in the '60s, was picked
up by Davis even though his nickname
was Ooops! and two other teams had
dropped him. In the end, Davis could find
no better use for Hines than to fly him to
camp every Wednesday, dress him, report
him to the league as being there for a try-
out and use him during one practice to
challenge his cornerbacks. ''You could do
that back then,''says Al LoCasale, Davis's
longtime assistant. Well, the Raiders
could.
But what do you say then of Cliff
Branch? He was an Olympic-level sprint-
er who languished until the fourth round
of the 1972 draft before Davis's scouts fi-
nally pulled the trigger. ''Took two years
to get him ready,'' says Davis. Branch
ended his career with 501 catches, second
of an experiment. Initially a wide receiver,
he was converted to defense his sopho-
more season at Tennessee. He ended up
becoming an All-America and the Raid-
ers'first-round draft choice in 1988.
Others, though, either by their nature
or their experience, are track men who
are under development. Graddy, yet an-
other Vol, insists he is a football person
but admits the sheer lack of repetitions
has handicapped him. In fact, he only
made the Tennessee team as a walk-on.
And despite subsequently breaking the
world record in the 60-yard dash, he
couldn't shake loose for more than three

Over a nine-day span, from July 20 to 28,
Mariner centerfielder Ken Griffey Jr. tied
a major league record by hitting a home
run in eight consecutive games. To appre-
ciate how remarkable that feat is, consid-
er the following:
o Griffey, the Pirates' Dale Long (1956)
and the Yankees' Don Mattingly (1987)
are the only three players in history to
homer in eight straight games. No other
major leaguer has reached seven straight,
and only 10 have hit homers in si games
in a row.
Had Griffey homered on July 29, he
would have done what 18 teams have not
done this year-hit a home run in nine
consecutive games.
e During the streak, Griffey hit more
homers than 1l teams did.
e Besides Griffey, only three Mariners
have gotten a hit in eight straight games
this season. Don't laugh. Eight-game hit-
ting streaks aren't as easy as they sound.
the fourth game of the streak, Cleveland
manager Mike Hargrove, figuring his
team wasn't having any luck against Grif-
fey anyway, instructed catcher Junior Or-
tiz to tell Griffey what pitch was coming
from Albie Lopez. Ortiz did. ''I popped
up,'' Griffey said. On Griffey's next at bat,
Ortiz wasn'ttelling. Griffey homered.
The night the streak ended, 45,607
fans-including 30,220 who bought tick-
ets the day of the game, the most walk-ups
in Mariner history-came to the King-
dome to see if Griffey could break the
record. The crowd cheered his every
move.''If he had hit a home run his last at
bat,'' said Mariner pitcher Erik Hanson,
''the roof would have come off, and we'd
have an outdoor stadium.''

It was no coincidence that in first base-
man Fred McGriff's first week with At-
lanta, the Braves scored 10 or more runs
in four consecutive games for the first
time since the team moved to Atlanta in
1966. Through Sunday, McGriff had
started ll games since coming over from
San Diego, and the second-place Braves
won 10 of them. In McGriff's 11 starts the
team averaged 8.8 runs and pounded 23
homers. McGriff batted ,404 with seven
homers and 13 RBIs.
Atlanta general manager John Schuer-
holz says the awakening of the Braves'
bats ''is because of Fred. This was a good
offensive team lying in wait, but it hadn't
been kick-started until his arrival. Before,
you'd look in the eyes of these players and
you'd see them battling to carry the club.
Now you look in those same eyes, and you
see the eyes of the hunter.''
The team the Braves are chasing may
well be uncatchable-at week's end the
Giants led by 7% games, and 15 of the 56
games left on their schedule were against
the Marlins, the Rockies and the Pa-
dres-but with McGriff, Atlanta at least
has hope. ''He has given us a shot of
B-12,'' says outfielder Otis Nion. ''He's
relaxed our big guns, When you have ter-
rific pitching like ours, it adds more pres-
sure when you don't hit, But the attitude
has changed with Fred. We definitely
think we can get back in this thing.''
The Braves traded for McGriff to try to
win this year. Don't be surprised if they
deal him after the season-not because
they don't like him, but because his salary
is $4.25 million both this year and next,
and he can be a free agent after the 94

When I wrote The Spy Who Came In from
the Cold, the head of operations at the Se-
cret Intelligence Service remarked that it
was the only bloody double agent that ever
worked.'The mythmaking that went on all
around us contributed to the kind of in-
grown and corrosive self-perceptions that
were at the heart of our undoing.
q. Rou worked in British intelligence as a
young man, How do you look back upon
those years now?
A. I was recruited almost when I was still
in diapers into that world. My really for-
mative years, the years when one should
be having nice little love affairs and doing
different jobs and finding out who one
shouldn't be and that stuff, they were all
taken over by the secret world.'The moods
that I remember, the self-perceptions I
had, were very positive, very negative; I
was brilliant, I was a complete idiot. I en-
tered it in the spirit of John Buchan and
left it in the spirit of Kafka.
O. Waas there a particular incident that
formed your view of espionage?
A. I remember one episode where I was
obliged to interrogate a British official
about his alleged involvement in an espio-
nage ring, and he lied to me. He just lied all
the way through. I made a very reasoned
submission to my superiors and went on
to other things and discovered to my as-
tonishment a few months later, this man
had been promoted. So I was terribly wor-
ried, and I started to shake the bars. Final-
ly I was taken aside and told to ask no
more questions about the matter. And of
course years later I realized that he had
been our man, our informant, inside the
ring that we had penetrated. Therefore I
wasactually simply part of his cover story.
All they wanted me to do was rubber-
stamp him so he could get on with his life
again.
O. How do you ensure that the spies remain
honest brokers of intelligence and dont try
to distort it for their own ends?
A. What we've seen again and again, when
there's been a Watergate or there's been
something else, is this curious mixture
that includes the real zealots who believe
they can repair the inadequacies of the
democratic system by doing unofficial
things. They think they're the heroes.
Then you see the total misfits who need to
take shelter in secret rooms and who actu-
ally get off being secretive.
It is actually only very excited, over-
stimulated men on very short sleep, to-
gether with all the toys of supersecrecy
and the helicopters and the special passes,
that inevitably produce irrational behav-
ior. But those people, when they began,
were ordinary guys; they were like us.
Nol Annan, who was in British intelli-
gence for years, said nobody should be al-
lowed to do it more than three years, that
one way of keeping an intelligence service
sane is to have it run entirely by tempo-
rary people.
Q. When the cold war ended, did you feel
any nostalgia?
A. I didn't have nostalgia, but I went
through some of the trauma that the
spooks had definitely been through. Was
there nothing there? Maybe it was all a
waste of life. Maybe I should have just
been running a boy's club. I had this
weird kind of sub-life in some part of my
head, where I sort of kept up with events
from a spy's-eye view. I was never a very
good spook; I was definitely a writer who
took up spying rather than a spy who
took up writing.
0. So you were happy to see the cold war
end...
A. Yeah, I was thrilled. Part of my present
indignation is thatI want the world to be a
better place now. I think the Americans
have the energy and the record and the
right to conduct the altruistic crusade. I
think it's totally incorrect politically to
Suggest it, but a new period of altruistic
white colonialism is upon us.
0. PaxAmericana Moralistica?
A. Yes, a little bit, although I don't think it
need be as expansive as we fear. I don't
see you sort of ferrying your armed po-
lice all over the world keeping order. I
think it's much more how you throw
your weight in the world arena political-
Iy, and how you demonstrate your out-
rage at flagrant misbehavior in places
where it can be stopped.

My answer to the second part
It's great to hear that you have
found an activity that you enjoy,
and that you want to take your
swimming to the next level.
Swimming is a terrific exercise,
because it works so many muscle
groups at once. I would suggest
that you go to a gym and get some
good instruction in strength train-
ing. Most of the power motion
that you need in swimming comes
from the upper body, of course,
so concentrate on that. The latis-
simi dorsi, the large muscles just
below your shoulder blades, are
extremely important. You use
them in almost all swimming
strokes. In ordinary life situa-
tions, you don't work them so
much, but a good instructor can
show you the proper exercises for
developing the lats. Abdominal
exercises are important, too.
It also is essential for all swim-
mers to concentrate on flexibility
- especially for the butterfly and
backstroke, where you need to
focus on shoulder stretching
exercises. And in all events you
need to develop flexibility in your

ington Post and Newsweek, announced
that she was going straight home. This
was thought to be a reproach, even a
gesture (though it later transpired that
Mrs. G. actually had the flu). In the re-
sulting flutter of reaction, Lady Rams-
botham vowed to discontinue the age-
old practice of''ladies' withdrawal,'' and
in swift succession nearly every George-
town mansion followed suit. ''The only
exception was Pamela Harriman's,'' says
Peter Jay, who succeeded Sir Peter
Ramsbotham as ambassador, ''and ev-
eryone knows that Mrs. Harriman is a
law unto herself,''
True, no doubt, but that law, however
phrased, is still something of an English
law. It was the British who started the
idea of strict precedence and sexual seg-
regation at Washington dinners. Pamela
Harriman operates at the crucial inter-
section of Washington where living mem-
ories of Churchill and the Blitz-shared
by veterans such as herself and Evange-
line Bruce-mingle with high liberal
politics and elevated social tone. You
might not prove a connection between
Anglophilia and the Georgetown Demo-
cratic establishment, because proving
such a thing would be vulgar and strenu-
ous. But you may nonetheless assume it
and not go far wrong. The embassy
helps set the pitch and rhythm, both for
those who don't say ''Shall we join the
ladies?'' and for those who do.
This spring, the British ambassador
and his lady threw a little dinner dance
for Harriman. It wasn't too shabby, es-
pecially if you bore in mind that it was
to honor her being gazetted as ambassa-
dor designate to France. The Senate For-
eign Relations Committee hadn't yet had
the privilege of confirming Harriman,
and the French Embassy hadn't gotten
around to organizing its own fete, so the
British had managed to pre-empt both
the Congress and America's oldest ally.

Fred Hughes
Bellport, Long Island. Hughes asked him
to meet him at Warhol's house on East
66th Street, where they were joined by
Vincent Fremont, who had received the
news from Warhol's longtime physician,
Dr. Denton Cox. ''It was like being
punched in the stomach and thrown out
the window,'' Fremont told me. Later that
afternoon, Warhol's brothers, Paul and
John Warhola, flew in from Pittsburgh.
''One of the first things Idid,'' Ed Hayes
(who is a contributing editor of this maga-
zine) told me, ''was secure the incredible
warehouse of stuff Andy had accumulated
at his home, and in other places where he
kept things. Fred was afraid that when the
news got out lunatics and fans would try
to get into the house. So I arranged securi-
ty from the Major Case Squad. We had
probably the highest-quality security in
the Western world. I wanted guys I knew.
Homicide detectives.''
The following morning, Ed Hayes pre-
sented Fred Hughes with a two-page con-
tract appointing Hayes attorney for the
Warhol estate and stipulating that his fee
would be 2.5 percent of the estate's value.
(In April 1987, Hayes's fee was adjusted to
2 percent.) To date, Hayes has collected
$4.85 million for his own firm, and $6.7
million has been paid to other lawyers, in-
cluding Hayes's brother, Steve Hayes.
''Look, my career was going very
well,'' Ed Hayes told me as he planted
perennials in the garden of the East Side
town house he bought after going to work
for the Warhol estate. ''I was doing trial
work, I'd had some success as a real-es-
tate renovator, some substantial success,
right? And The Bonfire of the Vanities
was on every best-seller list. And I said to
Fred, 'Look, you want me to basically de-
vote full time to this. It's a tremendous
risk for me, not just for the years I do it,
but for clients I could've gotten to go for-
ward.' And I said, 'It has to be a once-in-
a-lifetime opportunity for me, too.' ''
I asked Fred Hughes why he hired Ed
Hayes. ''That's very easy, Bob,'' Hughes
replied. ''I didn't exactly hire Ed Hayes
on my own. Andy Warhol did. Then when
Andy died, horrendously, the lawyer that
I generally used and brought to the Fac-
tory in the first place-it wasn't anybody
else who brought Robert Montgomery [of
Paul, Weiss, Rifkind], and he was recom-
mended to me by Jean de Menil-was on
safari, So I desperately needed an attor-
ney, and I'd been working with Ed, and
Andy knew him-he's in the Diarrheas.''
Hughes was referring to The Andy Waarhol
Diaries, which contains a reference to War-
hol's meeting Hayes at a party in 1980.
''I was never aware of him being offi-
cially hired,'' Vincent Fremont said. ''I
met Ed Hayes that morning, and I remem-
ber Fred asking me later, 'What do you
think of Ed?' I didn't know what to think.
Fred was running the show as executor,
and it seemed O.K. And the decision to
let Paul, Weiss, Rifkind go was up to
him. I had no real say in it.'' Hughes told
me, ''Ed Hayes acted like he needed an
education for art, so I figured he was one
person I could kind of trust. Mistake.''
For a while it seemed that Fred Hughes,
Ed Hayes, and Vincent Fremont were one
big happy family. Hughes spent many
weekends in Bellport, and when Susi
Hayes had a baby girl a few months after
Warhol's death, he was asked to be Avery's
godfather. The next two summers, Vincent
and Shelly Fremont rented a house on Shel-
ter Island with Hughes and his then constant
companion, Sarah Giles, Vanity Fair's Eu-
ropean editor, who later rented an apart-
ment in the Hayeses' town house. And as
executor of the Warhol estate, Hughes,
supported by Hayes and Fremont, went
from triumph to triumph.
In April 1987, Hughes staged a grandi-
ose memorial service for Warhol at St.
Patrick's Cathedral, attended by more
than 2,000 people. In November 1987, he
signed a multimillion-dollar licensing deal
with Schlaifer Nance & Company, the
marketers of the Cabbage Patch Kids
dolls. In April 1988, Sotheby's conducted
a 10-day, six-catalogue auction of War-
hol's collectibles which brought in an as-
tounding $25.3 million. In May 1988,
210 Coca-Cola Bottles, an early-60s
painting, broke the million-dollar mark
for Warhol at auction when it was sold at
Sotheby's for $1.43 million. In August
1988, after a yearlong inventory super-
vised by Fremont, the Warhol estate was
appraised at $297 million, including $250
million in Warhol works. In November
1988, Marilyn Monroe 20 Times broke all
records for Warhol at auction, selling for
$3.9 million at Sotheby's. In December
1988, Sotheby's auctioned off a cache of
jewelry found under a filing cabinet in
Warhol's house for $1.64 million.
In February 1989, the Museum of Mod-
ern Art, which had never had a Warhol
exhibition, opened a two-floor retrospec-
tive, which went on to Chicago, Paris,
lLondon, Cologne, and Venice. In March
1989, the 800-page Andy Warhol Diaries
was published by Warner Books, which
had paid a $1.2 million advance. In May
1989, Interview was sold to newsprint
magnate Peter Brant for $12 million, after
a byzantine competition that involved S. I.
Newhouse, the late Malcolm Forbes, Jann
Wenner, and Ronald Perelman. That same
month, at Christie's, Warhol's auction
record was broken again when Shot Red
Marilyn hit $4.07 million. And in October
1989, the Warhol Foundation, along with
the Dia Foundation and the Carnegie In-
stitute, announced plans for an Andy
Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh.
But things were not as rosy as they
seemed from the outside. I attended a
meeting at the Factory in late 1987, for
example, where the strain on Hughes, and
on his relationships with both Hayes and
Fremont, was already becoming notice-
able. In 1980, Broadway producer Lewis
Allen had taken an option, renewed every
year since then, on Warhol's Philosophy
and Exposures books, which I owned half
of as a ghostwriter on the former and co-
author on the latter. Allen planned to
adapt them for a multimedia musical star-
ring robots of Warhol and his dachshunds,
Archie and Amos. Hughes surprised Al-
len, Warhol's literary agent, Roz Cole,
and me by announcing that he was against
renewing the option again because, as he
said, ''Idon't control this project.'' When
Cole said that ''a certain degree of trust''
had been established over the previous
seven years, Hughes stood up behind his
huge desk in his huge, all-red office and,
throwing his hands into the air, roared, ''1
don't trust ANYONE/'' Fremont sank into
his chair in embarrassment, but didn't say
a word. A few minutes later Hayes ar-
rived, and Hughes attacked him. ''Where
were you?'' he snapped. ''When I tell you
to be someplace at 2:30, I expect you to
be there at 2:25. Got ir?''
It was only later that I learned that
Hughes had recently been diagnosed as
having a progressive form of multiple
sclerosis, a disease of the central nervous
system which need not reduce life expec-
tancy but which causes widely varying
symptoms that can range from blurred vi-
sion and slurred speech to complete paral-
ysis. During the 10-day Sotheby's auction
in April 1988, Hughes was sporting a sil-
ver-topped walking stick that seemed
more like an elegant accessory than a
physical aid. Less than a year later, at the
party for the opening of the MoMA retro-
spective, he was so dependent on his cane
that he spent most of the night sitting at a
table and waiting for people to come to
him. By November 1989, at the memorial
service at the Metropolitan Museum for
Diana Vreeland, his closest friend and
most important mentor after Dominique
de Menil, he was in a wheelchair.

publishing, about a high-level job at the illus-
trated weekly Paris-Match. Alex had listened
carefully to both offers, but in the end he was
not seriously tempted. Both he and Tatiana felt
committed to New York-they never wanted to
live anywhere else-and besides, in spite of his
mother's repeated jeremiads about wasting his
life, Alex was proud of the work he did for
Vogue. The other magazines, House d Garden
and Glamour, mattered much less to him; he
chose their covers and laid out each issue with
flair and inventiveness, but it was Vogue, the
flagship, the crown jewel of the Conde Nast em-
pire, that occupied the major share of his at-
tention. Vogue had its own mission, which in
Alex's mind was to ''involve women in the life
of the moment.''
He was proud of bringing serious art--con-
temporary art included-to the attention of
Vogue'sreaders. Although Alex sometimes wor-
ried that the magazine was simply paying lip
service to the fine arts, the truth was that Vogue
had become an important catalyst in the Amer-
ican public's postwar love affair with art. The
artfeatures in Vogue never cheapened or trivi-
alized the subject, and their level of sophistica-
tion, thanks to Alex, was fairly high. Almost
every issue carried an essay by an important
critic: Harold Rosenberg, Lawrence Alloway,
and Clement Greenberg were among the fre-
quent contributors. The critics, however, were
getting to be as competitively jealous as the
artists, Some years later, when Vogue published
a Penn portrait of Greenberg in its ''People Are
Talking About'' section, along with an admir-
ing note that called him ''the American critic
best known around the world,'' Harold Rosen-
berg cut Alex dead on the street, wrote him an
angry letter, and then broke off all relations be-
tween them.
Alex still clung to his own belief in the ''no-
bility'' of Vogue's civilizing mission. The word
cropped up whenever he was called on to write
something for or about Vogue-an article on
beauty, a preface to a book of fashion pho-
tographs. In his mind, the concept of woman at
her best was a noble idea, to which Vogue gave
far more than lip service. He knew, of course,
that there was another side to this coin. The fe-
male image was being used more and more bla-
tantly to sell products of all kinds-cars and dish-
washers and cigarettes as well as haute couture-
and Vogue was coming to be looked upon in
some circles, along with other fashion journals,
as nothing more than a seductive environment
for advertising. Until the 1980s, however, Alex
was still able to see it as something more than
that, ''In choosing a Vogue cover,'' he said. ''I
never used to think, 'Will itsell?'Ihonestly did
not, Our attitude in those days was that if some-
thing was right for Vogue, the readers would
have to like it.'' Although he always insisted that
layout was ''not a creative process,'' he pushed
himself and his colleagues in the art department
to surpass themselves month after month, tear-
ing up completed layouts regardless of the cost,
turning what might have been resentment into
a spirit of shared adventure. ''He would come
in the artdepartment and rip everything up, but
you never felt he was destroying anything,'' said
Tina Fredericks, whom Alex made art director
of Glamour when she was only 23. ''He was al
ways positive. He raised your confidence level.
Ifelt he was my mentor, my father, my favorite
man in the whole world, and I think 100 other
women must have felt the same way.''
All his trips to the studios of major artists
had convinced him that he could not live their
sort of life, or endure the solitude that it re-
quired. Whenever a photographer talked about
doing'serious'' work for Vogue, Alex would of-
fer the same advice. Treat Vogue as a commer-
cial job, he would say, and use the money to do
your serious work on the side. His own case,
however, was more complicated. Alex's work
for Vogue was as serious, and in some ways as
deeply committed, as the work he did on week-
ends in his studio. His mother had itwrong: He
needed both.e

WORKING T OUT
Continued from page 222)
like shorter skirts (so women could walk), pock-
ets (to free the hands), and corsetless dresses
(that didn't require a husband to lace them)-
as for the right to vote. None of the above be-
came a reality until the twenties, though, when
fun-loving flappers shortened their skirts and
their hair. Designers like Paul Poiret furthered
the cause by throwing out the corset-a real
bone of contention among women who were
sick of suffering indigestion in the name of an
unnatural S-shaped silhouette known tellingly
as the kangaroo bend.
The next hurdle was pants. Eyeing a sailor
on the Duke of Westminster's yacht in the mid-
1920s, Coco Chanel started making pants for
casual attire. They were deemed ''amusingly
perverse,'' but more perverse was the fact that
Chanel had to wrap women in gold chains in or-
der to make her pants popular. Although dare-
devils like Amelia Earhart had a good excuse
to wear pants on the job, it took the blessing of
Hollywood-and irreverent screen stars like
Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich, and, later,
Katharine Hepburn-to prove that women
could be successful and sexy wearing pants.
That was Hollywood, though. For the work-
ing girlnext door, pants didn't become a reali-
tyuntil World War II, when women-or ''slacks
girls''-went to work in the factories in cover-
alls and dungarees. Wartime clothes rationing
eliminated such luxuries as silk stockings, there-
by necessitating pants to cover the legs. De-
signers weren't immune to the strict rationing
orders of the day, either. Instead of focusing on
high fashion, they worked to adapt men's uni-
forms to women's needs. Mainbocher created
militaryinspired suits for WAVES (Women Ac-
cepted for Volunteer Emergency Service), Lil-
ly Dache fashioned factory bonnets out of util-
ity cloth, and Claire McCardell transformed
functional fabrics into her famous simple wrap,
the ''popover dress.''
But when the GI's came home, Rosie the
Riveter slipped out of her overalls and back into
her girdle, hat, and gloves. Newsreels discour-
aged women from working, in the name of pa-
triotism. The higher standard of living in the
1950s, abetted by the first credit card and the
birth of a consumer society known as the mid-
dle-rich, pushed women back into constricting
dresses, Christian Dior had declared that
''clothes should be constructed like buildings,''
and Grace Kelly became the blueprintfor a gen-
eration of women who aspired to fragility.
It took a real cultural revolution (the sexual
one) and serious discontent (of the political
kind)to finally liberate women and get them
out of skirts and into pants--in all kinds of cir-
cumstances, from the office to evenings out. So-
ciety columnist Eugenia Sheppard introduced
the career woman as fashion plate in 1967; ''This
year... the hard workers look incomparably
better than most of the wealthy women who
would settle for jewelembroidered dresses...
and let it go at that.'' By the mid-seventies,
women were joining the managerial work force
in record numbers. For lack of a better business
uniform, they adopted the man's suit with a
skirt, And uniform it was. Suddenly armies of
women were flooding offices with basic blue
suits, white blouses, and floppy bow ties. The
idea was to stop looking like women and start
looking like executives.
Soon enough women realized that these
''confidence builders'' didn't leave much room
for femininity or fashion. Sure, they wanted to
look legitimate in a man's world, but women
didn't necessarily want to look neutered.
Sportswear designers like Anne Klein and Liz
Claiborne came to the rescue with more casu-
al, career-oriented separates, but it was Gior-
gio Armani who managed to soften the actu-
al suit without taking the authority out of it.
Combining fluid fabrics with firm shoulder
pads, Armani came up with an answer to the
men's business suit that endowed the wearer
with confidence instead of cookie-cutter uni-
formity. By the late seventies, the power suit
was born.
''I was reacting to the consciousness of
women coming out of a long, hard, and much-
opposed feminist movement with their backs
broken,'' says Armani today of the power sil-
houette he sculpted over a decade ago. ''They
were just breaking into the workplace and they
needed a stronger, more dignified image that
adhered to the rules of the man's uniform.''
By 1985, as working women confronted the
difficulties of ''having it all,'' and the boring blue
suit became relegated to entry-level status, ex-
ecutive women started searching for a formu-
la-a uniform of their own-that didn't sacrifice
their power or their femininity. Donna Karan
responded with her sophisticated, sensual al-

Invest in mutual funds. Although
emergency funds should be kept liquid in
a bank, credit union or money-market
mutual fund, other savings should be in-
vested for a higher yield. Ungar suggests
growth stock funds for college savings.
They carry a higher risk than some mutual
funds, but have returned an average of 17
percent a year over five years. If Renae
and Pablo hold their shares for at least 10
years-until Leanne starts college-Ungar
says, ''The risk would be somewhat miti-
gated.'' His advice: Buy only funds rated
four or five stars by Morningstar, the mu-
tual-fund rating service.
Sharkey agrees, suggesting such no-
load mutual funds as Janus Fund, Neu-
berger & Berman Guardian or Partners
funds, and Financial Industrial Income
Fund.
Make regular investments, re-
gardless of share prices. If you put a
set amount into a mutual fund every
month, you'll get more shares when prices
are low. This reduces your average cost
per share, producing what's known as
dollar-cost averaging. Starting small and
dollar-cost averaging, says Sharkey,
should ease Pablo's fear of investing.
Restructure Pablo's Iife insur-
ance. With two young children and an
unemployed wife, Pablo needs more life
insurance than the $100,000 he carries.
Medley favors $300,000 of term life. Un-
gar suggests $500,000 of level term-
enough to pay off the Florida mortgage
and provide income for Renae and the
children. With careful shopping, he says,
Pablo should be able to buy the coverage
for $425 a year.
Explore tax-sheltered saving
plans. The experts urge Pablo to contrib-
ute to the 401(k) tax-deferred savings
plan at work as soon as possible. This
should come before starting an IRA be-
cause most employers match contribu-
tions to a 401(k) plan-and those contri-
butions are not subject to current income
or Social Security taxes.
Put the Florida house on the back
burner. ''Wait out the housing cycle,''
says Medley. ''Time-and not a lot of it-
may solve the problem.'' Even though the
Arayas have a small net loss from renting
the place, they do get tax advantages from
home ownership. If being landlords
proves emotionally wearing, they could
sell at a loss and borrow what's needed to
pay off the mortgage. The one thing they

program, Headrick and her colleagues par-
ticipated in a series of exercises, such as
scaling a 42-foot wall in groups of three
linked together with rope, much as their
fates within the company would be linked.
Teammates on the ground held belay ropes
andtold their climbers where to place their
feet and hands. For Headrick, a perfec-
tionist, the wall was a Waterloo: ''I had to
make a decision, after talking to my team-
mates, that Iwas not able to climb the wall.
They had to come down withme,so itkept
them from climbingit, too''In the end,she

Unlike Collins S Aikman Textile
Group,spurredby crisis, the Taylor group
of companies moved to participative man-
agement out of foresight. James Taylor,
president and CEO, and his brother John,
treasurer, are third-generation managers
ofthe boat-accessories subsidiary, Nelson
A.Taylor,based in Gloversville, N.Y., that
their grandfather started in 9o8. The par-
ent company employs over soo people in
six plants scattered about the U.S., Ireland
andCanada. Duringthe mid-8os, the sub-
sidiary, an industry leader best known for
windshields and window glass, was riding
thewave of strong growth that was sweep-
ing the marine industry, That was making
theTaylors nervous.''We had managed the
company as a benevolent dictatorship,''
saysJames.''ButI started to realize that the
old way of doing things just wasn't going
to workin the future.''His search for new
ideas came to an end when he discovered
Stayer's Harvard Business Revieu article.
The Taylors have been working on
changing their company for almost three
years now, and they both feel strongly
that they have done the right thing. But
every step has been painful, and the
brothers agree: ''You can't let your ego
get in the way,' says 49year-old James,
whose tone lets you know he has tripped
over his own ego more times than he
cares to count,''You have to change your-
self,'says John, 42.''The organization is
only a reflection of the people. So if all
the people believe in top-down manage-
ment, the organization is top-down.''Like
Eitel, the Taylors learned early on that
empowerment cannot coexist with fear.
James realized he would have to learn to
shut up when he heard, during an early
self-management meeting, that some of his
people had coined the word''Jimidation.''
Initially, it was as hard for the workers
to take responsibility as itwas for the Tay-
lorsto relinquishit,'''The first team we ever
formedwas one to come up with new work
rules,' says James, After a few weeks, sev-
eralworkers told him to write the rules him-
self. All that's changing now. Workers at
each plant have written new rules for work
and compensation, and some teams even do
the hiring. The human-resources depart-
ment supports them by administering ben-
efits and assisting in locating candidates to
hire. And the managers have become coach-
es, SaysJohn,''One job is to outline certain
legal and ethical parameters things have to
be within, and to measure everything we
do against the needs of our customers''
Without empowerment, says [ames,
Nelson A. Taylor would very likely have
sunk last year, when the industry's rev-
enues fell by nearly half from '8g. But the
company rode out the storm.
CAR WARS The most widely noted
American empowerment success is also at
one of the biggest companies that adhere
to this ideology-General Motors, Not
long ago,few experts would have predict-
ed that an all-new American car could
have matched the reliability of Toyotas
and Hondas. But for the second year in a
row, GM's Saturn has done just that,
according to the current annual auto issue
of Consumer Reports,
Some credit must go to the Saturn
plant's managers, who from the start
were determined to build the bestAmer-
ican car ever. But credit must go also to
workers-and empowerment. Mercedes
Benz's 3oo and 9o series, veritable
tapestries of fine engineering, are signif-
icantly less reliable than Saturn, says
Consumer Reports, But then, Daimler-
Benz, the manufacturer, is not perceived
to be as empowered or as lean as Saturn.

Clinton backs independent Social
New YorkTimes
WASHINGTON - In a reversal of ad-
ministration policy, President Clinton
says he now supports the creation of an
independent federal agency to run Social
Security, the nation's biggest social pro-
gram.
The change, administration officials
say, is the result of an informal deal be-
tween Clinton and Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, the New York Democrat who
is chairman of the Finance Committee. In
exchange for the president's support for
the new agency, the officials said, Moyni-
han will redouble his efforts to get a
health bill out of the Finance Committee
by the end of May.
Moynihan and lobbyists for the elderly
have long sought the change for Social
Security, saying it would bolster public
confidence in the program. Some 42 mil-
lion people now receive monthly Social
Security benefits.
Clinton's support virtually guarantees
that the Social Security administration
will be given independent status. The
agency, created in 1935, is now part of the
Department of Health and Human Ser-
vices. With outlays of $318 billion this
year, Social Security accounts for 50 per-
cent of the department's budget and 21
percent of the entire federal budget.
In March, by a voice vote, the Senate
approved a bill to establish Social Securi-
ty as an independent agency. The House
has passed similar bills three times in the
last decade, most recently by a vote of
350-8, but those bills died in the Senate.
Donna E. Shalala, the secretary of
health and human services, opposed the
creation of an independent agency. Like
her predecessors in the Reagan and Bush
administrations, she argued that Social
Security must be closely coordinated with
Medicare, Medicaid and other programs
run by the department. People apply for
Medicare at Social Security offices.
Moynihan said, ''Social Security was
once a model agency run by the great civil
servants of the New Deal era.'' But in the
last 15 years, he said, ''the agency has
lost some of its distinctive energy'' as top
officials in the department focused in-
creasingly on health policy.
In recent years, the senator said, the
Social Security Administration has been
''brain dead and lost in the exurbs of the
Department of Health and Human Ser-
vices.'' As a result, he said, service to ben-
eficiaries has deteriorated and a majority
of workers fear that Social Security will
not have enough money to pay the retire-
ment benefits they have earned.

Democrat who is chairman of the House

NEW ERA
By RICH BURK
Houston Chroncle
Fifty-seven years after the closing of
Houston's last major horse track and
seven years after Texas voters approved
parimutuel wagering, the grand old sport
of horse racing returns to Houston this
week when Sam Houston Race Park opens
its doors for a 45-day thoroughbred racing
meet.
Gov. Ann Richards, members of the
state racing commission and local officials
are expected to be among a crowd of about
15,000 when the racetrack, an $85 million
facility in northwest Harris County, begins
racing at 1 p.m. Friday.
For Texas horse racing fans, it has been
a long time coming. From the time the
Texas Legislature voted to repeal its
gambling law in 1937 until Texas voters
approved pari-mutuel wagering in 1987,
the state was without''the sport of kings.'
Five Class II and III racetracks have
been in operation at one time or another
since late 1989, but it is only now that a
Class I racetrack is set to begin racing.
Ceremonies to commemorate the open-
ing are scheduled for noon. Chris Lincoln
of ESPN's Raceborse Digest will be the
emcee.
There will be three stakes races on the
card, including the $100,000 Governor's
Day Handicap at a mile and 70 yards. Two
six-furlong races, the $25,000-added Mes-
quite Handicap for Texas-bred colts and
geldings, and the $25000-added Pecan
Handicap for Texas-bred fillies and mares
also will be run on the 10-race card.
Races will be run at 1 p.m. on both
Saturday and Sunday before the track
settles into its regular schedule next week.
The post times then will be7 p.m. for races
on Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, 3 p.m.
on Wednesday and 1 p.m. on Saturday and
Sunday through the end of the meeting on
June 19.
The track will reopen for a 73-day
quarter horse race meet on July 1. The
quarter horse meet ends Sept. 18.
Sam Houston Park will not be the city's
first major horse racetrack. Epsom
Downs, on what is now Jensen Drive in
northeast Houston, opened on Thanksgiv-
ing Day in 1933 and drew a crowd of more
than 25,000. It ran its final race on March
27,1937, and never reopened after the state
Legislature voted to repeal the parimu-
tuel bill it passed in 1933.
Epsom Downs and three other Texas
tracks of the period - Arlington Downs in
Arlington, Alamo Downs in San Antonio
and Fair Park in Dallas - all enjoyed
success in the short time they were open.

The possibility of legalizing abor-
tion in Latin America has largely
been ignored by local politicians.
But, in Brazil, as the campaign for
October's presidential election is be-
ginning, the Workers Party, the
party of front-runner Luis Inacio
Lula da Silva, recently suggested
that decriminalizing abortion would
be part of its presidential platform.
Da Silva immediately declared.
''As a Christian, citizen and married
person,I am against abortion.'' Soon
after, the Workers Party dropped its
stand on abortion.
Seeking to reiterate the position of
the Roman Catholic church on popu-
lation issues, the Vatican has been
gathering all ambassadors to the
Holy See to explain Pope John Paul
II's message for the U.N. Conference
on Population and Development that
will be held in Cairo in September.
In March, the pope once again
declared the church adamantly op-
posed to abortion, contraception and
sterilization.
Even though clandestine abortion
is a prevalent means of birth control
throughout Latin America, family
planning programs in the region are
considered successful. Since the
early 1960s, the average family size
in Latin America has decreased by
about 45 percent, from six children
per woman to a little over three.
The number of women being
treated for complications related to
induced abortion in hospitals alone
in these six countries - about
550,000 a year - ''point to a health
problem of large dimension,' Dr.
Susheela Singh and Dr. Deidre Wul,
researchers from the Guttmacher
Institute, write in the institute's
quarterly publication, International
Family Planning Perspectives.
''We hope to influence policy-mak-
ers within Latin America to recog-
nize the need for more focused re-
search on this problem,' Singh said.

MOSCOW -- The advertisement
for a secretary in a Moscow newspa-
per listed computer skills, typing,
English and German as necessary
qualifications. It also specified that
applicants should be 18 to 25, 5 foot7
and have long hair. ''There will be a
contest,'' it said.
The advertisement was just one of
scores placed every day that list
youth and sex appeal as job require-
ments. It was also among the more
courtly. Some Russian employers
include another prerequisite in their
advertisements: bez kotmpleksov, or
''without inhibitions.'' Everyone in
Russia knows what that means.
In Moscow's bustling new business
community, it is usually not frowned
upon to grope the secretary, to re-
quire that the new office manager be
single, long-legged and blond, or to
offer to discuss a filing clerk's raise
after work in a hotel room - and
dismiss her if she refuses.
Sexual harassment in the work-
place is rampant in today's Russia,
and the sexism that thrived under
the Communists is growing worse,
aggravated, feminists say, by the
new lawlessness that rules the busi-
ness world.
The new Russia is known for its
violence. There is also a heady sense
of permissiveness fed by porno-
graphic videos, sexy advertising,
nightclubs, casinos, beauty contests,
nude pinups and open prostitution.
This has helped spawn a work-
place climate of sexual swaggering
and bullying that is no longer imag-
inable in the United States after
figures like Anita Hill and Robert
Packwood made the term ''sexual
harassment'' part of the national
lexicon.
''Women view their bodies as a
way of furthering their careers -
that's just the way it is,' said Igor
Bunin, the author of a study on the
''new Russian businessmen'' pub-
lished this month. ''Sexual harass-
ment is absolutely not a real prob-
lem in Russia.
''I assure you,' he added,''there is
no opposition on the part of women
to this.''
Many women do not see it his way.
Irina, 23. a graphic designer who did
ceived many formal complaints.
''The pay at Western companies is so
much higher,' he said, ''that most
women just smile and bear it.''
There are no feminist newspapers,
and only one women's magazine, the
monthly, distinctly unglossy Female
Worker. But a Russian edition of
Cosmopolitan, a magazine known
more for advising women on the arts
of seduction than on how to fight off
an amorous boss, is scheduled to hit
the stands in Russia at the end of the
month.
Its publisher, Derk Sauer, who also
owns The Moscow Times, described
his project as a service to newly
prosperous Russian women. ''The
magazine will not just be about
fashion,'' he said.''It's about relation-
ships and careers and sex.''
And sexual mores have changed.
There are more and more women,
feminists say, who freely trade sex-
ual favors for salary and perks,
because good jobs are scarce and
employers can more easily replace
recalcitrant or older employees than
they could under Communism.
Job seekers who do not wish to
sleep with their employers attach a
postscript to their advertisements,
intim nye predlagat, ''no intimate
relations.''
The current hedonism repels Dmi-
tri Babich, a young reporter for the
daily Komsomolskaya Pravda. He
was so appalled by a recent televi-
sion advertisement for office equip-
ment that depicted a secretary lean-
ing over her leering boss, her breasts
exposed, that he put his phone num-
ber in an article and asked women
who had experienced sexual harass-
ment to call.
''A fourth of the calls were from
men thinking it was an ad for phone
sex,'' he said.
His editors were equally confused
about the article he planned. ''They
scheduled it for an erotic supple-
ment,'' he said.
He eventually dissuaded them. His
article ran last week under the head-
ing,''School of Survival.''
Such articles are extremely rare
in the Russian press.
''When I first heard Americans
using the expression 'sexual harass-
ment' I was utterly baffled -- I
thought it was some kind of custom,
gaged to
Heather MacLachlan. a 35-year-old
tennis manager, was the real reason
he decided not to seek re-election
and had declined nomination to the
Supreme Court.
''It was not a factor,'' responded
the mild-mannered Mitchell, who
continued to tease the journalists by
claiming his stepping down from
public life was''a matter of personal
decision'' he had made in January.
Mitchell continues to be coy about
whether he would accept the job of
Major League Baseball commis-
sioner, a position that pays about $1
million annually.
He acknowledged his lifelong in-
terest in the sport, relating to report-
ers how he even kept a baseball
signed by former Boston Red Sox
star Ted Williams in his office.
But Mitchell said his political and
sports allegiance came into conflict
once when he found out that Wil-
liams was campaigning for Republi-
can George Bush. He said he almost
considered throwing out the ball.
Oh, the way we are...
Selected friends of the music in-
dustry, ie. key members of Congress
and staff serving on committees im-
portant to the entertainment busi-
ness, have a shot at the hottest tick-
ets in town: Barbra Streisand's sold-
out Washington concerts.
Sony Music Entertainment and
two music industry trade groups
have made tickets available to 500
members and staff for $50 to $350,
the face-value price depending on
the seat.
Roll Call, the twice-weekly news-
paper covering Congress, reported
most of the selected members serve
on the Judiciary and Commerce
Committees, key panels for the mu-
sic industry. It also reported the re-
sponse has been light.
Streisand, on her firsttour in 20
years, will be in Washington May 10
and May 12. Her concerts sold out
within an hour.
Collider debate not dead
The superconducting super col-
lider, the North Texas science pro-
ject''killed'' by Congress, is far from
dead in debate on Capitol Hill.
Chief House opponent Sherwood
Boehlert, R-N.Y.,says he will be
ready withan amendment anytime
somebody tries to slip money into
the collider budget to do anything
other than shut it down.
Calling Boehlert a''sore winner,'
Rep. Martin Frost, D-Dallas. says
the Boehlert approach could prevent
some worthwhile uses of the idled
collider site and complicate the set-
tlement thatTexas is counting on to
getits investment back. Frost could
have considerable influence on the
future of Boehlert's effort because
theTexan serves on the''traffic cop''
Rules Committee that determines
how legislation is debated on the
House floor.
Seeking a bigger cushion
Sometimes, what seems like a ma-
jority cannot be counted on to stand
up when the going gets tough. That's
the message from backers of a
House bill that would let members
bring up individual items in the
budget and propose their elimina-
tion. One prime target could be the
space station.
The budget-cut free-for-all al-
ready has more than a majority of
the House as co-sponsors, backers-
say. But they want a bigger cushion
than the 231 votes (13 more than a
majority) they have because, as an-
aide to Rep. Bill Zeliff, R-N.H., said,
they cannot be sure the same people
would sign a petition forcing the bill
onto the House floor for debate. That
petition takes the same number of
votes, 218, but is sensitive because it
puts members at odds with the
House leaders who control the flow
of legislation to the floor.
Ross Perot, erstwhile candidate
for president and a strong backer of
the budget-cut bill, told a news con-
ference last week:''All the leaders,
are going to try to nuke it. It will
take a tremendous amount of cour-
age to stand up and be counted on'
this.'
Penny-pinching ideas
Another idea from Perot, the bil-
lionaire penny-pincher who wants
the federal budget cut wherever pos-
sible, is to start federal economizing
with the federal furniture.'The gov-
ernment spends millions getting new
furniture into offices when it should
realize ''the value of antiques.' Perot
told a news conference on Capitol '
Hilllast week.
When he heard''antiques,'' Rep.
Bill 2Zeliff, R-N.H., stepped forward
to ask Perot a question: ''Are you
talking about the (House) members,
or about furniture?''

Chronicle Politicat Wr(ter
Hillary Rodham always was an
''A'' student, and yesterday, in the
regal state dining room of the
White House, First Lady Hillary
Clinton pulled in top grades again.
In a hastily called hourlong
news conference, Mrs, Clinton ex-
haustively answered reporters'
questions about her successful
commodities trading and question-
able investments in the Whitewat-
er Development Corp. in a force-
ful, seemingly forthright manner.
During the remarkable session,
broadcast live during the soap
opera and ''Oprah'' time slots, the
First Lady said she did nothing
wrong butrepeatedly acknowledg-
ed that she had not been as sensi-
tive as she might have been to the
right of the press and the public to
know about her financial history
and that of her husband.
''Tve always believed in a zone
of privacy, and I told a friend the
other day thatIfeel after resisting
for a long time Ive been rezoned,''
she told reporters, appearing
poised and relaxed. ''Iam extreme-
ly comfortable and confident
about everything that I have done
and about my ability to communi-
cate that clearly and to give the
information that you all need.''
Mrs, Clinton often responded
with long, earnest answers when
asked to explain the discrepancies
in the numerous statements that
she and the president have issued
concerning her commodities trad-
ing in the late 1970s and the cou-
ple's money-losing investment in
the Whitewater Development
Corp. in the early 1980s.
But she added little of sub-
stance to what is already in the
public record about the confusing
Whitewater case now under inves-
tigation by a special prosecutor -
or how she turned a $1,000 invest-
ment into a $100,000 bonanza.
However, in a tour de force
that will surely be remembered
longer for itt style than its sub-
stance, Mrs. Clinton appeared to
wear down her questioners with
her pleasant, nondefensive de-
meanor, articulate responses and
absolute command of her subject.
''We went into Whitewater to
make money, not to lose it,'' she
said at one point. ''It keeps getting
beat like the deadest horse it is,
over and over again.''
Asked specifically whether the
Clintons should have known that
Whitewater was not making mon-

''The Chronicle is deeply
grateful to Tom for his many
years of superb service as a re-

Washington
The White House acknowledg-
ed yesterday that states such as
California are being unfairly bur-
dened by the costs of jailing illegal
immigrants and asked Congress to
spend $850 million to ease the
strain.
The initiative, which would
provide only moderate relief for
California, was immediately criti-
cized as insufficient by Governor
Wilson, although he conceded it is
a step in the right direction, Wil.
son said the state will proceed with
plans to sue the federal govern-
ment for full reimbursement.
The White House proposal
comes amid mounting pressure
from the states and was announc-
ed to reporters just minutes before
California officials disclosed de-
tails of their lawsuit, which will be
filed next week.
''After many years of virtual
neglect of the illegal immigration
issue, our administration is taking
major steps to address this prob-
lem,'' Clinton said. ''When people
enter this country illegally and
commit crime while they are here,
it is not fair to ask the states to
bear the entire costs of their im-
prisonment,''
Elected officials in California
and Florida, who have staked con-
siderable amounts of political capi-
tal on the issue, applauded the an-
nouncement but said the proposal
was woefully insufficient.
''This is welcome, but it won't
be enough,'' Governor Wilson said.
His aides said California alone
spends about $00 million a year to
jail about 17,000 undocumented
immigrants who have been con-
victed of felonies.
'This is a good start,'' echoed
Senator Bob Graham, R-Florida.
''However, our goal is for the fed-
eral government to take full, not
partial, responsibility.''
The debate on who should bear
the costs of undocumented immi-
grants has emerged as a major bat-
tleground over federalism, as cash-
strapped governors demand reliet
from officials in Washington. The
issue has become a boilerplate for
political rhetoric, with anger
mounting against illegal immi
grants-- half of whom are in Cali-
fornia.
''I keep shaking my head (at
federal officials) who in effect
keep saying we will take our time
and come up with means of find-
ing the money,'' Wilson said.
''What the hell do they expect the
state to be doing in the mean-
time?''
The White House initiative
would provide little relief for Wil.
son, who has left a $2.3 billion hole
in his proposed 8526 billion bud-
get, a hole he says is created by
money spent on illegal immi-
grants. Under the White House
proposal, which must be approved
by Congress, California is not ex-
pected to receive more than $200
million.
Wilson's aides said the state
will file a lawsuit Friday in U.S.
District Court in San Diego, seek-
ing full reimbursement for incar-
ceration costs. And that suit, they
said, will be followed by a series of
other legal actions seeking reim-
bursement for the costs of educat-
ing and providing health care to
undocumented immigrants.
New York and Florida have fil-
ed similar lawsuits.
Even though Wilson has said
the state is counting on the federal
reimbursements to balance the
state budget, a senior Wilson aide
said yesterday that the state is less
interested in Washington picking
up the tab for programs than it is
in pressuring policymakers to
crack down at the border.
''Our real point here is not re-
imbursement,'' said the aide, who
asked not to be identified. ''One of
the reasons the federal govern-
ment lets this go on and on is be-
cause they do not have to pay for
it,''
South African Town Moves Toward Race
By Louis Freedberg
CArontcleStaPWrter
Tulbagh,South Afriea
Grabam Pienaar, once an un-
abashed defender of apartheid, is
proud of thesteps this threecentu-
ryold rural hamlet has made to-
ward racial discovery and recon-
ciliation.
Tulbagh,a serene town of 2,500
whites and 144500 ''coloreds,'' as
people of mixed racial descent are
described here, is a long distance
from the blackon-black violence
that has convulsed South Africa's f
urban townships.
But the accommodations that '
have been reached between Tul-
bagh's whites and its once oppress-
ed coloreds suggest that racial har-
mony may yet be possible in South
Africa.
The white school in this town,
nestled in the splendiferous Witz-
enberg mountains 90 miles from
Cape Town, in one of the country's
premier wine and fruit growing
regions, has voluntarily admitted
colored students.
For the first time, coloreds and
whites sit together on the Town
Council, and after a few protest
marches, the town's parks and
swimming pools have been opened
to all races. Coloreds have begun
moving into the allwhite town
without any signs of white flight.
Even the rugby team, once a sym-
bol of white supremacy, is racially ,
mixed.
Pienaar, the town mayor, owns ]
the only supermarket in Tulbagh ]
pronounced Tillbuck).
Like other whites here, he now ]
admits apartheid was a ''mistake.'' ]
''Apartheid wasvery successful j
committee'' that Krone establish-
ed 10 years ago.
The committee runs the spa-
cious community center, day care
center and medical center on the
farm.
'There were always good rela-
tionships here,'' said Awie Bell, 48,
a colored farm mechanic who
heads the committee. ''Here we
have the opportunity to express
our viewpoints, without Mr. Kro-
ne's interference.''
At Tulbagh's high school, with
an enrollment of 820, students
seem almost unaware of their
place at the heart of South Africa's
transformation, Two years ago, 12
colored students enrolled for the
first time, without a ripple of pro-.
test, Their number has now grown
66. Principal Willie Visagie likes
telling visitors how 284 out of 22
parents voted in favor of the
change.
But leaders of the African Na-
tional Congress say that that the
patina of racial harmony is decep-
tive.
The Town Council may consist
of coloreds and whites, but the col-
ored members were not democrat-
ically elected, said William Lewis,
48, secretary of the local ANC
branch. He said they were hold-
overs from the old Labor Party, a
conservative group in the discred-
ited tricameral parliament that ex-
cluded blacks but gave token rep-
resentation to coloreds.
Claims that facilities are inte-
grated are also exaggerated, he
said.
Evidence of civilization dating back 12,000 years has been
found at Moccasin Bend, but grave robbers have plundered up to
1,100 graves since the site was rediscovered a half-century ago.
''The ground looks like where artillery has come in, the gravedig-
gers have made so many holes,'' says Bob Welch, a Cherokee mem-
ber of the new patrol.
m A PLACE IN THE SUN: Florida nudists, concerned about
gawkers at the beach, have worked out a deal with federal park
rangers for privacy at Canaveral National Seashore. Park offi-
cials had distributed fliers saying clothing is optional all along the
24-mile stretch of beach, but the nudists objected. A revised flier
will state that nudists generally congregate in areas beyond the
paved roads at Playalinda and Apollo beaches. The arrest of nud-
ists at the park last year led to a court ruling that public nudity in
Florida is allowed unless it is for lewd or lascivious reasons.
mA HOUSE DIVIDED: Richard O'Hara and son Shawn have at
least one thing in common: Each wants Mississippi Republican
Trent Lott out of the U.S. Senate. Richard, 77, is running against
Lott in the June 7 GOP primary. Shawn, 36, an evangelist, is run-
ning for the Democratic nomination and a chance to face Lott in
November.... Alabama state Sen. Hank Sanders (D-Selma) and
his law partner, J.L. Chestnut, have both signed up to run for San-
ders's seat, but there's no animosity between the two. Chestnut got
into the race because of talk that local Democrats may dump Sand-
ers from the ballot to punish him for supporting independent can-
didates in local races.

Women drop from London race
Kunming - Just when the Chinese women distance
runners were to resume their record assault, along with picking
up some cash for themselves and their government, they
surprisingly dropped out of this morning's London Marathon.
Race officials had agreed to pay $750,000 to Chinese
officials, outbidding two other marathons, just to guarantee the
appearance of the country's top-five distance runners, coached
by Ma Junren. In addition, with the top-three finishers being
drug tested, the race was to afford the Chinese an opportunity to
douse suspicions of drug use.
London marathon officials received a fax 10 days ago from
Huang Zhi, general secretary of the Chinese Athletic
Association, saying the athletes had been unable to train
recently due to ''bad health'' and would have to skip the race.
Invitations have been extended to the Chinese to compete in
the New York Games next month and the New York Marathon
in the fall. Race officials have received no response.

Projected returns indicate party

IOHANNESBURG, South Africa
-- Nelson Mandela's African Na-
tional Congress is headed for a
landslide victory in South Africa's
first multiracial democratic elec-
tion, according to sample results
from around the country.
Even though the official vote
count was delayed by massive ad-
ministrative foul-ups, ANC Secre-
tary General Cyril Ramaphosa pre-
dicted an ''overwhelming victory
.., of more than 60 percent'' at a
midday press conference. His fore-
cast was based on reports from
ANC observers at counting stations
aroundthe country, analyzed by the
organization's American pollster,
Stanley Greenberg.
The projected national returns in-
dicate that the ANC will win ap-
proximately 250 of the 400 seats in
the new National Assembly -
whose first order of business within
the next 10 days will be to elect
Mandela president.
If the projections hold up, the
ANC will also be entitled to one of
two deputy presidencies and 16 to
18 ministries in a 27-member cabi-
net of national unity. The other dep- i
uty presidency will go to President
Frederik W. de Klerk, whose Na-
tional Party is projected to finish
second. His party would have four
to six ministries.
Thesample returns indicated that
in a country whose electorate is
roughly three-quarters black, the
ANC will win approximately 90 per- 1
cent ofthe blackvote. It willlose the
whitevote by an even more lopsided
margin. And it appears to be losing
the mixed-race colored vote by a 2- 1
to-1 ratio, meaning it is in danger of
losing two provinces - the Western
Cape and Northern Cape - where
coloreds are in the majority.

Discrimination can pervadebrotherhood of badge
By KATHLEEN GORMAN
Courant Staff Writer
1994, The Hartford Courant
It happened to Herbert Sharp soon
after he was hired as a Rocky Hill police
officer in 1989.
He was living in Hartford, so he went
to Rocky Hill one evening to drive
around and learn the layout of his new
beat.
But he learned something else in-
stead.Sharp, who is black, was followed
for miles by a white police officer until
he left Rocky Hill.
''If you're black and in a neighbor-
hood, then you're suspicious,'' said
Sharp, 28, the town's only black police
officer.
Sharp and eight other black and His-
panic police officers interviewed this
month said they were not surprised by
recent disclosures that some Avon offi-
cers had targeted black and Hispanic
motorists for motor vehicle stops. They
said it has happened to them.
Four other minority officers inter-
viewed said they have not been stopped
without cause by other officers. All the
officers interviewed were chosen ran-
domly.
Those police officers who have been
hassled said it has happened during
their off-duty hours when they drive
into the mostly white suburbs of Hart-
ford and other large cities to do their
shopping, banking and other errands.
The officers interviewed said they have
been hassled less frequently in recent
years, but suspect that is partly because
they are older and drive ''family'' cars,
such as station wagons.
They said although only a few officers
seem to discriminate, it is a problem that
taints many suburban departments.
Washington Post
WASHINGTON -- The Clinton
administration Saturday put off an
expected ultimatum to China over
its piracy of music, movies and com-
puter software rather than risk ag-
gravating a larger conflict with Bei-
jing over human rights.
Trade officials repeatedly had
warned China that it would be cited
for its failure to crack down on com-
panies that illegally copy and export
$800 million in intellectual property
each year. The designation of China
as a ''priority'' offender would have
led to retaliation against Chinese
goods later this year if the practices
continued.
But after an intense series of
meetings and phone calls within the
administration, some involving
President Clinton, the action was
delayed until July 1 - well after a
June 3 deadline on the human rights
issue.
Clinton has said he will cancel
China's preferential ''most favored
nation'' trading privileges if it has
not made ''significant progress'' on
improving human rights by then.
According to the administration,
China has not yet satisfied Clinton's
conditions, which cover an account-
ing of political prisoners and the
mistreatment of dissidents and reli-
gious minorities.
The delay on the piracy issue sug-
gested an unwillingness to provoke
China's leaders, whose next moves
on human rights could either help
salvage Clinton's China policy or
perhaps create an explosive con-
frontation.
U.S. Trade Representative Mick-
ey Kantor told reporters Saturday
that the piracy decision had been
delayed to prevent it from compli-

For the most part, U.S. successful in northern Iraq
By GEORGE GEDDA

WASHINGTON - The tragedy in
northern Iraq last week called atten-
tion to the largely anonymous,
U. S,-led military and relief mission
in that region in the three years
since the Persian Gulf war.
The United States is chiefly re-
sponsible for protecting northern
Iraqi Kurds against Saddam Hus-
sein and coordinating with others in
providing food, fuel, electricity and
medicine to the beleaguered Kurds.
It is also among the prime back-
ers of U. N. Security Council sanc-
tions against Iraq, which have con-
verted the one-time oil giant into a
relative economic pygrmy.
There is satisfaction among U. S.
officials and others that the Ameri-
can and allied efforts since 1991
have kept the 3 million Kurds alive
and their would-be oppressors in
Baghdad at bay.
President Clinton told reporters
he believes the allied peacekeeping
mission has performed a ''very valu-
able function'' in protecting the
Kurds.
Three years ago, hundreds of
thousands of Kurds, their rebellion
crushed by Saddam's army in the
wake of the gulf war, fled in terror
to the mountains in neighboring
erations in northern Iraq a success,
others worry that the issue is not
receiving high-level attention, and
that a crisis could flare again.
Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chair-
man of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, said the United States
has lost its focus on Iraq.
''We've been diverted I guess by
other problems around the world,''
he said. ''But my own sense is that
Iraq is going to come back into the
news in the months ahead because
there's erosion for support of the
U. N. sanctions.''
France, China and Russia have
shown varying degrees of support
for a reassessment of the sanctions.

YOKOHAMA, Japan -- When
Morihiro Hosokawa took office as
prime minister last year, promising
to lower taxes and prices to make
life better for Japan's silent majority
of urban consumers, he raised
hopes in the Hibari housing com-
plex, where 500 middle-class fam-
ilies live in small apartments in 21
identical concrete buildings.
Now, Hosokawa's sudden deci-
sion to resign is being viewed in Hi-
bari with disillusionment.
Despite his fresh appearance and
flashy style, the people say, Ho-
sokawa accomplished little to make
their lives easier. And despite vow-
ing to clean up politics, he had to
resign because of questions over his
fiancial dealings.
''People had high hopes for Mr.
Hosokawa, but they were be-
trayed,'' said Fumiko Ando, who
works in a flower shop just outside
the apartment complex. As a result,
she said, ''people's expectations to-
ward politicians are rather thin''
Taeko Hashimoto, 42, an exercise
instructor, said: ''I was hoping poli-
tics would make the lives of ordi-
nary people easier. But even before
Mr. Hosokawa resigned,I realized it
was a difficult task. We work and
work, but our lives never improve.''
That sense of frustration was ech-
oed by people from various walks of
life elsewhere in Japan.
''We were expecting that Ho-;
sokawa could achieve the reform of ]
Japanese politics,'' said Dr. Michio ]
Naito, 73, a physician in Fujiyoshida ;
City, at the base of Mount Fuji, ''But ;
although our expectations were ]
high, we found that he also is just ]
like an old-fashioned politician.''
Given their low faith in politics, ]
people seemed to care little about ]
who the next prime minister will be. ]
Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, a]
key player in the governing coali- ]
tion, is expected to emerge from the ]
current political jockeying as the ]
winner.
Although the maneuvering to ]

NEW YORK (AP) -- Ralph
Ellison, whose first and only novel,
Invisible Man, captured America's
patchwork of ideologies and identi-
ties as a great debate among the
overlooked, died yesterday, He was
80.
Ellison, who had been polishing
the manuscript of his second novel,
died in his Manhattan apartment,
said his editor, Joe Fox of Random
House. Ellison had pancreatic can-
cer.
With Invisible Man, Ellison
sought to write a great American
novel, not just a great black Ameri-
' can novel. The rite of passage story
] won the 1952 National Book Award.
] More than 1 million copies have been
] sold.
It chronicles an idealistie, un-
] named young black man's humilia-
] tions in the South and in Harlem,
] from campus life to street riots.
The grace and complexity of
] Ellison's prose was enriched by the
] depth of his ambition - his desire to
] follow the tradition of Mark Twain,
] Herman Melville and other 19th cen-
] tury novelists.
''When I write, I am trying to
] make sense out of chaos,'' Ellison
told The Nen York Times in 1966.
''To think that a writer must think
about his Negroness is to fall into a
trap.
''I am a novelist, not an activist,'
he said. ''But I think that no one who
reads what I write or who listens to
my lectures can doubt that I am
enlisted in the freedom movement,''
The opening lines of the novel
made clear Ellison's commitment to
revealing the perspective of Ameri-
ca's disenfranchised and shunned.
''I am an invisible man,'' he
wrote. ''No, I am not a spook like
those who haunted Edgar Allan Poe;
nor am I one of your Hollywood-
movie ectoplasms. I am a man of
substance, of flesh and bone, fiber
and liquids - and I might even be
said to possess a mind. I am invisible,
understand, simply because people
Now there's an 'urban survival' plea
psychological abuse.
''The reasons those were successful is be-
cause the defendants were white and middle-class
or upper-middle class,'' Shellow said.
Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz said
the defense claim in the Osby case is more
plausible than in those cases.
Those defendants ''had options,' Dershowitz
said. ''They were middle class. They could leave.''
But Dershowitz also fears the ''urban survival
syndrome'' reinforces racist stereotypes: ''It
sends a message out that 'you have to be scared of
blacks. They are not like the rest of us.' ''
Another Osby defense attorney, David Bays,
said: ''For me to point out these facts, it may
appear to be a racist position to take. But for other
young blacks to take that position based on what
they have seen and known in their own neighbor-
hoods and their own lives, that's not racist.''
Israeli, PLO talks cover everything from stamps
CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- On one side of
the table sits Maj, Gen. Amnon Shahak, born
in Tel Aviv four years before Israel was
founded in 1948.
On the other is Nabil Shaath, a Palestin-
ian businessman who was 8 when his family
was exiled that year from Jaffa, then an Arab
town, now a Tel Aviv suburb.
They lead the Israeli and PLO teams
that have negotiated for six months on how
to implement the Israeli-PLO peace accord
signed Sept. 13 at the White House.
In talks that resume today, they hope to
work out the final details of Israel's
withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the
West Bank town of Jericho, so Palestinian
selfrule can begin.
So far, the debate has been difficult -
harsh at times - to the point that the
negotiators missed the Dec. 13 target for
Israel to start the withdrawal and a second
deadline, last Wednesday, for completing it.
Shahak says strains between the two
sides run deep.
In an interview with the Israeli newspa-
per Yedioth Ahronotl, he decried the Pales-
tinian team's anger when Israel recessed the
talks to mark Holocaust Day in memory of
six million Jews killed by the Nazis.
''Nabil is perhaps one of the few on the
other side who knows something about the
Holocaust,' Shahak said. ''It could be that we
have the same problems in understanding
their sensitivitie,''
The Palestinians want not only the cor-
ner of Palestine offered for autonomy, but
anything that can be construed as a symbol
of the future state they seek.
One argument has been over whether
they would have their own postage stamps.
Shaath, 54, is a stamp collector.
The Israelis have sought to focus the
negotiations on security, for Jewish settlers
in the occupied territories and for Israel
itself.
That is Shahak's area. A career military
man, he commanded a paratroop unit in the
1967 Middle East war, when Israel captured
Gaza and the West Bank. He also served in
intelligence and is now the army's deputy
chief of staff.

SI0CIAL TO THE GLOBE
M AN FRANCISC0 - On the morning after,
1 or even as late as five days after unpro-
teeted ses, 160 women will walk one by
j one into a room at San Francisco General
A Hospital, swallow up to three white pills
and hecome the first Americans to test the French
] abortion drug, RU-186, as an emergency contracep-
] tie.
Calling the clinical trials ''a new era in reproduc-
] tive research for women,'' Dr. David A. Grimes, the
] principal investigator, said that if the landmark
] study is successful, RU-486 or a similar drug could
] reduce the need for abortion.
''And that's a cause everyone should rally around
l regardless of their beliefs,' said Grimes, who began
l last week searching for volunteers. In the first 21
hours after the study's announcement Tuesday, 80
l women called before his clogged answering machine
automatically shut down.
According to the nurse who is screening volun-
] teers, the callers are married as well as single, and
] range in age from 18 through their 40s. They tell of
] broken condoms and moments of passion that made
] them skip birth control''just this once.''
But even as some women clamored for the drug,
] which has not been approved for marketing in the
] United States, Richard Glasow of the antiabortion
] National Right to ILife Committee, said women were
] being misled into thinking of RU-486 as an emergen-
] cy contraceptive, when in fact it is an abortion pill.
''The proposed testing of RU-186 as a contracep-
] tive is fundamentally misleading,' Glasow said,''be-
] cause it works not to prevent contraception but to
] cause abortion.''
] Glasow and many other opponents of abortion
] maintain that human life begins the moment the
] spermjoins with the egg.
] However, Grimes, professor of obstetrics and gy-
] necology at the University of California at San Fran-
] cisco, said that most scientists consider a woman
pregnant when a fertilized egg becomes implanted in
her uterus, which occurs up to two weeks after fertil-
ization. Thus, very early use of the drug would be
preventing, not ending, pregnancy.
''The pill works before pregnancy has started,''
Grimes said.
Glasow said that researchers in this study were
attempting to repackage RU-186 as a contraceptive
to help promote the drug's legalization in the tnited
States.
Only Britain, France, China and Sweden allow
mainly used to induce abortion in women in the ear-
liest weeks of pregnancy, although it has begun to be
used as a morning-after contraceptive in Britain,
This new study, sponsored by the World Health
Organization with the approval of the US Food and
Drug Administration, jumps ahead of a long-awaited
US trial of RU-186 as an abortion pill.
The drug is already being studied elsewhere in
the United States for other uses, including as a
treatment for fibroid tumors and endometriosis, and
as an alternative to chemotherapy for women with
breast cancer.
Although Roussel-Uclaf, the French manufactur-
er of RIU-186, has agreed to US tests of the pill for
abortion use, negotiations have dragged on for more
than a year with the Population Council, a New
York-based research group Koussel has chosen as
its licensee.
That delay comes on top of a history of reluc-
tance by Roussel to tangle with the Reagan and
Bush administrations' antiabortion stance and with
right-to-life groups, which have threatened to boy-
cott products of Hoechst Celanese Corpp., the tS
suhsidiary of Roussel-Uelaf's parent commpany.
Hoeschst AG of Germany.
The San Francisco study, in whieh RU-486 will
be supplied by Roussel, probably would not have
been possible without the Clinton administration's
decision last year to encourage research into RU-1N6
that could lead to FDA approval.
Overlooked in the controversy over RU-4S6,
Grimes said, is the fact that so-called postcoital con-
traception is already available to American women.
Two tablets of a birth control pill ealled Ovral
taken within 72 hours of having sex and two more
pills 12 hours later have been proven effective in
preventing pregnancy, Grimes said. But women who
follow this morning-after pill regimen experience un-
pleasant side effects, including vommiting, which i-
why interest has focused on RIUU-1S6, he said.
The San Francisco study is part of a lurger inter-
national effort to determine the minimum effective
dosage of RU-486 as an emergency contraceptice.
Although studies in Britain have shown that 600 mil-
ligrams of RU-1N6 in three pills can prevent preg-
nancy, researchers Suspect a lower dosage, with fow
side effects, can also he effective.
If the drug fails and the women hecome preg-
nant, they will he offered abortions at no cost.
Potentially, the drug could gain approval hy the
Food and Drug Administration as an emergency
contraceptive before it is approved as an abortion
pill. Once a drug is approved, it may he used by doc-
Reno, Cisneros is the Cabinet mem-
ber who most seems to delight in
rubbing elbows with the public. ILike
the president, Cisneros enjoys both
''town hall'' meetings and one-on-one
chats, He knows the art of listening.
Friends of the secretary say all
the outreach leaves little time for a
private life. Cisneros tries hard to
spend some evenings at home with
his wife, Mary Aliee. His 6-year-old
son, John Paul - named after the
pope - recently underwent major
heart surgery.
Cisneros' decision to attend the
funeral of Yetta Adams, the woman
who died on HUD's doorstep in De-
cember, was characteristic of his at-
tempts to rekindle a feeling of ur-
gency about a social problem. The
president has left the homeless issue
almost exchsively to Cisneros, al-
though Clinton's budget would dou-
''This is a new day,' Cisneros de-
clared, vowing that if necessary he
would summon federal marshals tu
protect future black tenants.
Cisneros and his assistant secre-
tary for fair housing, Roberta Ach-
tenberg, won praise from civil rights
groups for conceding that racial dis-
crimination within the public housing
system is rampant. By contrast, dur-
ing the Bush and Reagan years,
HUD denied bias in dozens of court
battles. The agency is now likely tu
settle most of those suits, Achten-
berg said.
In other areas, such as fixing up
its public housing and fostering eco-
nomic development in poor neigh-
borhoods, critics say HUD is a long
way from offering solutions.
lLast week, Cisneros outlined re-
forms designed to eliminate or con-
solidate 59 HUID programs. He also
vowed to let local housing officials
use modernization funds to replace
run-down public housing units with
new units - a financing tool that
could rid the country of some of its
worst publie housing high-rises.
Cisneros has also committed
himself to continuing former HUD
Secretary Jack Kemp's program to
sell public housing units to tenants.
But in many developments, HUD i.
still a slumlord. At the same time,
families may wait years for a publie
housing unit or a rent subsidy. In
199S, HUD had only 10.6 million
units to meet the needs of an esti-
mated 14.3 million people.
Michael Kane, director of the
Boston HUD Tenant Alliance, is
skeptical of the plan to decentralize
HUD - a pet idea of Cisneros'.''The
career bureaucracy is not going to
change,' Kane said.
Yet in an interview Cisneros in-
sisted that''reinventing HUD is very
real,'' He grabbed a a pen and
sketched a pyramid representing the
distribution of the agency's 13,500
employees, Then he turned the
sketch upside down to show how
power would shift to workers in the
field.

TURNERS FALLS, Mass. -
It's a bumpy ride up a mountain
road to the spotless home of Paul
and Louise Desilets.
He is a carpet cleaner and local
landlord, devoutly Roman Cath-
olic and contemplative. She
directs Sunday school at Our
lLady of Czestochowa Church. As
a hospice visiting nurse, she com-
forts patients who choose to die
at home.
But there are certain choices in
life that the Desilets cannot
abide.
''Allowing fornication to occur
on property I own places my eter-
nal soul at risk,'' says Paul,
seated in his living room near a
two-foot statue of the Virgin
Mary.
Instead, Desilets, 41, has put
himself at legal risk by refusing to
rent an apartment to an unmar-
ried couple.
That would be Mark Lattanzi
and Cynthia Tarail.
lLawsuit's fifth year
Lattanzi and Tarail's anti-dis-
crimination suit is entering its
fifth year in Massachusetts and is
sparking a national debate about
fair housing, religious freedom
and sexual mores. Twenty-four
groups - from Focus on the
Family to Gay and Lesbian
Advocates and Defenders -
have filed friend-of-the-court
briefs in the matter pending
before the state supreme court.
Lattanzi came to the Connecti-
cut River village of Turners Falls
in 1989 as a Vista worker orga-
nizing tenants to buy buildings
and convert them to cooperative
housing.
Now, at 27, he is a local coordi-
nator for a private project against
housing discrimination.
When Lattanzi and Tarail saw
an ad in the local daily newspa-
per for a $400-a-month, two-bed-
room apartment, they were inter-
ested. They had been sharing the
rent with a family of four in a
five-room apartment.

poor economy. In the North American market, automotive
and truck brakes, safety restraints, aftermarket products and
turbochargers had substantial carnings growth. Productivity
improvements and higher sales volumes substantially reduced
prior year losses in Brazil. The 1993 results include an after-
tax charge of $5 million reflecting the current year's impact of
adopting FASB No. 112.
The Company introduced new ABS products in Europe and
the U.S. in 1993 which strengthened its position in braking
systems for new vehicle production. Although its market share
remains less than 10 percent, the Company is developing
more advanced technology that should strengthen its competi-
tive position by 1996.
Increased competitive activity across all product lines and
increasing product and cost demands from customers will
continue to put pressure on the Company's automotive busi-
ness. However, the Company believes it will more than offset
these market conditions through product innovation, aggres-
sive productivity actions to reduce costs and by accelerating
the process of supplying integrated automotive systems to the
global marketplace. To improve operating efficiencies, the
Company initiated plans in 1991 and 1992 to significantly
reduce the number of its worldwide locations. By the end of
1993. 20 operating plants had been closed. Sales offices, distri-
bution centers and research and development facilitics are
also being consolidated.
Engineered Materials had a 7 percent sales increase. Sales
of fluorinc products, including cnvironmentally-safer substi-
tutes for CFCs, grew substantially and sales of laminate sys-
tems, oximes, performance additives and tar products were
materially higher. Sales of carpet and industrial fibers also
improved, but sales of intermediate chemicals and environ-
mental catalysts were lower because of weak market
conditions.
Engineered Materials' adjusted net income was signiticantly
higher in 1993 because of strong productivity gaitns and
itmprovcd revenues for fluorinc products, industrial fibers, per-
formance additives and tar products. Rcsults also improved for
UOP. Partially offsetting these gains wcre highher operating
costs for laminate systems, reduced demand for intermediate
chemicals and lower earnings for Paxon. 1993 results include
an after-tax charge of $2 million reflecting the current year's
impact of adopting FASB No. 112.
Regarding environmental matters, the Company is
subject to various federal, state and local requirements relating
to the protection of the environment. The Company believes
that, as a general matter, its policies, practices and procedures
are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environ-
mental damage and that its handling, manufacture, use and
disposal of hazardous or toxic substances are in accord with
environmental laws and regulations. However, mainly because
of past operations and operations of predecessor companics,
the Company is a party to lawsuits and claims and has
incurred remedial respotnse and voluntary cleanup costs asso-
ciated with environmental matters. Additional lawsuits, claims
and costs involving environmental matters are likely to con-
tinue to arise in the future. The Company continually con-
ducts studies, individually at Company-owned sites, and jointlv
1) Amounts are net of repurchases.
The only material financial instruments which are not car-
ried in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at amounts which
approximate fair values are certain debt instruments. The car-
rying value of long-term debt and related current maturities
cxcluding capitalized lease obligations), is $1,687 and $1.906
million and the fair value is $1.945 and $2,100 million at
December 51, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The fair value of
the long-term debt is estimated hased on the quoted market
price for the issues (if traded) or based on the current rates
offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining
maturity and characteristics.
The Company entered into two new credit agreements (5
Year and 564 Day Credit Agreements) dated July 7. 1993, with
commitments aggregating $900 million, with a group of 21
banks. These agreements replaced a $1.11 billion arrange-
ment. The funds available under the Credit Agreements may
be used for any corporate purposc. Loans under the $450
million 3 Year Credit Agreement are required to be repaid no
later than July 7. 1996. Annually, the Company may request
that the maturity of the 3 Year Credit Agreement be extended
by another year. The Company intends to request an exten-
sion of the agreement in 1994. The banks' commitments to
lend under the $45(0 million 364 Day Credit Agreement termi-
nate on July 5. 1994 and any loans then outstanding will be
converted to term loans maturing on July 5, 1995. The Com-
pany intends to renegotiate this agreement in 1994. The Com-
pany has agreed to pay facility fees of ,10 percent per annum
and .15 percent per atnnum on the aggrcgate commitments
for the 364 Day and 5 Year Credit Agreements, respectively,
subject to increase or decrease in the event of changes in the
Company's longterm debt ratings. The Credit Agreements do
not contain restrictions on the Company's ability to pay divi-
dends or requirements that the Company maintain a specific
net worth. They do contain other customary conditions and
events of default, the failure to comply with, or occurrence of
which, would prevent any further borrowings and would gen-
erally require the settlement of any outstanding borrowings
under either Credit Agreement. Such conditions include the
absence of any material adverse change in the ability of the
Cm1pany to pay its indebtedness when due, and such events
of default include (a) non-payment of Credit Agreement debt
and interest thereon, (h) non-compliance with the terms of
the covenants, (c) crossdefault with other debt in certain
circumstances, (d) bankruptcy and (e) defaults upon obliga-
tions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.
Interest on borrowings under the Credit Agreements would
be determined, at the Company's option, by (a) an auction

1993 vs. 1992
Consolidated net income for 1993 amounted to $1,820
million, compared wnth a loss of $74 million incurmed in
1992. Excluding the cumulative effects of adoption in 1992
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.
106, 'Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions,' and SFAS No. 109, 'Accounting for
Income Taxes,' 1992 earmings were $850 million. Net in-
come in 1991 was $1,484 million, which mcluded the cumu-
lative benefit of $311 million associated with the adoption
in 1991 of SFAS No. 96, 'Accounting fot ncome Taxes.'
Year-to-year comparisons in net income were affected by
various items, summarized n the table below:
Favorably affecting 1993 net income were gains of $190
million associated with the disposition of certain Canadian
properties and investments, and tax benefits of $113 million.
Adversely affectng 1993 results were charges of $170 rnml-
lion associated with the wmitedowm of Congo exploration
and production operations to current recoverable value and
additional deferred taxes of $53 million due to the effect of a
tax rate change resulting ftom enactment of the Omnibus
Budget Reconcliaton Act of 1993. Included m 1992 results
were charges of $805 mllion associated with a strategic
reassessment of business operations. Partially offsetting
were benefits of $90 million related to natural gas contract
settlements and $90 million associated with revised esti-
mates of tax obligations and retirement of debt.

T his discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operat-
j ing results, financial condition and liquidity/cash flows of Anheuser-Busch
j Companies, Inc. during the threeyear period ended December 51, 1993. This dis-
j cussion should be read in conjunction with the Letter to Shareholders, financial
statements and financial statement footnotes included in this annual report.
Two unusual occurrences had negative impacts on the company's 1995 earnings. In
September 1993, the company announced a Profitability Enhancement Program which
includes significant organitational and operational changes to improve sales and prof
itability The Program includes the following clements:
*An enhanced retirement program for salaried employees
The write-down of underperforming assets and investments
The restructuring and reorganization of the company
This Program is expected to generate cost savings of more than $100 million in 1994
and $400 million a year by 1997.
The restructuring and reorganization element of the Pogram includes the following ini-
tiatives designed to increase efficiencies and reduce operating costs:
* Brewery modernization programs based on the successful practices employed at the com-
pany's newer breweries. Such programs include increased employee involvement to
improve quality and efficiency throughout the entire 15brewery system.
Relocation of the company's food products operations to St. Louis. Additionally bakery
facilities will be modernized and consolidated.
The Program is also designed to improve sales of the company's premium beer prod-
ucts through aggressive advertising and the introduction of new products. The company's
newest product, Ice Draft from Budweiser, was rolled out nationwide in January 1994.
As a result of the Program, the company recognized a $565 million ($1.26 per share)
restructuring charge during the third quarter 199- Further information concerning the details
of the restructuring charge is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Additionally, the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1995, signed into law during the third
quarter 1995, increased the corporate federal statutory income tax rate by one percent-
age point retroactive to January 1, 1995 This retroactive income tax rate increase resulted
in a $55 million, or $.12 per share, non-recurring aftertax, non-cash charge related to
revaluation of the deferred tax liability in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard
No. 109 (ES 109)-Accounting for Income laxes.
The non-recurring restructuring charge and the non-recurring deferred tax revaluation
charge distort comparability of 1993 and 1992 reported financial results. lo fcilitate evaluation
and understanding of the company's 1995 financial results, key financial comparisons affected
by these charges are disclosed in this discussion both including and excluding the charges.
Earnings for 1992 were impacted by the adoption of new accounting principles.
Effective January 1, 1992 as discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, the company adopted the financial accounting standards for postretirement
benefits (ES 106) and income taxes (FS 109). The company elected to immediately rec-
ognize the cumulative effect of adoption of ES 106/109 pertaining to years prior to
1992 through a one-time cumulative effect adjustment which decreased 1992 net
income and earnings per share by $76.7 million and $.26, respectively These amounts
are separately identified in the company's consolidated 1992 income statement.
Ilmplementation of ES 106 in 1992 was based on benefit kvels in effect at the time of adop-
tion. Certain changes to these benefit kvels were implemented in 1995, thereby reducing the
ES 106 pretax expense amount in 1995 as compared to 1992by $27.0 million to $48.5 million.

Results of Operations
Revenues
Operating revenues for 1993 were $25.4 billion compared
to $30.2 billion and $29.3 billion for 1992 and 1991.
Commercial aircraft products and services accounted for
81, 80% and 78%a of total operating revenues for the
years 1993. 1992 and 199]. The Company's commercial
jet transport market share was approximately (6()P%4 in terms
of sales value for each of the three years.
Commercial jet transport deliveries by model:
Uommercial production rates were at 32: aircraft per
month at the beginning of 1993 and ended the year at 23
per month. In earlv 1994, the 74T production rate was
reduced from 5 to 5 per month, Based on current produc-
tion schedules, the 737 rate will be reduced from 10 to 8V
per month in the fourth quarter of 1994, the 757 rate will
be reduced from 5 to 4 per month in the first quarter of
1995, the 767 rate will be increased from 5 to 4 per month
in the first quarter of 1995, and the 747 rate will be re-
duced from 3 to 2 per month in January 1995. Planned
production rates will continue to be adjusted as necessary
to match customer orders, Production of the new 777
model is on schedule to support the flight test program
starting in mid-1994, and production activity will continue
to build until initial deliveries begin in mid-1995. Com-
mercial jet transport deliveries for 1994 are currently
projected to be in the 260 range. Commercial transporta-
tion sales trends are discussed further in the Commercial
Aircraft Market Environment section on pages 29-32.
The Company continues to be suhject to ongoing t .S.
Uovernment investigations of business practices and cost
classifications, lhese proccedings could involve claims by
the Government for damages, and under certain circum-
stances a contractor can he suspended or debarred from
fGoyernment contracts, 'The Company believes, based upon
all available information, that the outcome of the Govern-
ment investigations will not have a materially adverse
effect on its financial position or results of operations,
'The Company is subject to federal and state require-
ments for protection of the environment, including those
for discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of
eontaminated sites, )ue in part to their complexity and
pervasiveness, such requirements have resulted in the
Company being involved with related legal proceedings,
claims and remediation obligations over the past 10 years,
'[he costs incurred and expected to be incurred in connec-
tion with such activities have not had, and are not expected
to have, a material impact to the Company's financial
position. With respect to results of operations, related
charges have averaged less than 2%o of annual net earnings.
and have not exceeded 3%o in any given year,
The Company routinely assesses, based on in-depth
studies, expert analyses and legal reviews, its contingencies,
obligations and commitments to clean up sites, including
assessments of the probability of recoveries from other
responsible parties who have and have not agreed to a
settlement and recoveries from insurance carriers, 'The
Company's policy is to immediately recognize identified
exposures related to environmental cleanup sites based on
conservative estimates of investigation, cleanup. and
monitoring costs to be incurred.
Based on all known facts and expert analyses, the Com-
pany believes it is not reasonably likely that identified
environmental contingencies will result in a materially
adverse impact to the Company's financial position or
operating results and cash flow trends,
In January 1991, the Company received from the t.S.
Government a notice of partial termination for default
which terminatcd most of the work required under con-
tracts to develop and install a new air defense system for
Saudi Arabia, known as the Peace Shield program. The
Government has filed with the Company a demand for
repayment of $605 of Peace Shield unliquidated progress
payments plus interest commencing January 25. 199]. In
February 199l, the Company submitted a request for a
deferred payment agreement which, if granted, would
formally defer the Company's potential obligation to repay
the $605 of unliquidated progress payments until the
conclusion of the appeal process, In June 1991, the Gov-
ernment selected another contractor to perform the work
which is the subject of the contracts that have been termi-
nated for default, and the (Government will likely assert
claims related to the reprocurement. The Company does
not expect the Government to assert such claims prior to
completion of the reprocurement contract, which was
originally scheduled for late 1995.
Management's position. supported by outside legal
counsel which specializes in government procurement law,
is that the grounds for default asserted by the Government
in the Peace Shield termination are not legally support
able, Accordingly, management and counsel are of the
opinion that on appeal the termination for default has a
substantial probability of being convcrted to termination
for the convenience of the Government, which would
eliminate any Government claim for cost of reprocurement
or other damages, Additionally, the Company has a legal
basis for a claim for equitable adjustment to the prices and
schedules of the contracts (the ''Contract Claim''). Many
of the same facts underlie both the Contract Claim and
the Company's appeal of the Government's termination
action, The Company has filed its complaint in the tUnited
States Claims Court to overturn the default termination in
order to obtain payment of the Contract Claim. The parties
are currently litigating jurisdictional issues related to the
complaint, and are engaged in discovery, Trial is currently
scheduled for March 1907. The Company expects that its
position will ultimately be upheld with respect to the
termination action and that it will prevail on the Contract
Claim.
The Company's financial statements have been pre-
pared on the basis of a conservative estimate of the revised
values of the Peace Shield contracts including the Contract
Claim and the Company's position that the termination
was for the convenience of the (Government. At this time,
the Company cannot reasonably estimate the length of
time that will be required to resolve the termination appeal
and the Contract Claim, In the event that the Company's
appeal of the termination for default is not successful, the
Company could realize a pre-tax loss on the program
approximating the value of the unliquidated progress
payments plus related interest and potential damages
assessed by the Government.
The Company is subject to several U.S. Government
investigations of business and cost classification practices.
One investigation involves a grand jury proceeding as to
whether or not certain costs were charged to the proper
overhead accounts, No charges have been filed in this
matter, and based on the facts known to it, the Company
believes it would have defenses if any were filed. The
investigations could result in civil, criminal or administra-
tive proceedings, Such proceedings, if any, could involve
claims by the Government for fines, penalties, compensa-
tory and treble damages, restitution and/or forfeitures,
Based upon Government procurement regulations, a
contractor, or one or more of its operating divisions or
subdivisions, can also be suspended or debarred from
Government contracts if proceedings result from the
investigations. The Company believes, based upon all
available information, that the outcome of Government
investigations will not have a materially adverse effect on
its financial position or results of operations,

MBPD = Thousands of barrels per day
Chevron has sigmficant oil and gas exploration and production operations in Ngeria and in the
Angolan exclave of Cabinda, where its share of net production is about 100,000 barrels of crude oil
per day from each of these countries. ngola has experienced civil unrest following its 1992 elections;
separately, elements seeking independence of Cabinda from Angola have periodically created civil
unrest in the area of the company's operations, Also, the nullification of the Nigerian elections in
1993 has been followed by a period of political uncertainty. To date, none of these events has had a
significant impact on the company's operations, but the company is closely monitoring developments.
Enwironmentai matters. Virtually all aspects of the businesses in which the company engages
are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.
These regulatory requirements continue to increase in both number and complexity and govern not
only the manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells. Most of
the costs of complying with myriad laws and regulations pertaining to its operations and products are
embedded in the normal costs of conducting its business. Using definitions and guidelines estab-
lished by the American Petroleum Institute, Chevron estimates its worldwide environmental spend-
ing in 1993 was nearly $1.5 billion, of which $675 million were capital expenditures. These amounts
do not include non-cash provisions recorded for environmental remediation programs, but include
spending charged against such reserves.
In addition to the various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing
its ongoing operations and products, the company (as well as other companies engaged in the petro-
leum or chemicals industries) is required to incur expenses for corrective actions at various facilities
and waste disposal sites. An obligation to take remedial action may be incurred as a result of the enact-
ment of laws, such as the federal Superfund law, or the issuance of new regulations or as the result of
accidental leaks and spills in the ordinary course of business. In addition, an obligation may arise when
a facility is closed or sold. Most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to facilities and
sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable under
regulations existing at the time performed, but now will require investigatory and/or remedial work
to ensure adequate protection to the environment.
During 1993, the company recorded $215 million of before-tax provisions to provide for envi-
ronmental remediation efforts, including Superfund sites, Actual expenditures charged against these
provisions and other previously established reserves amounted to $183 million in 1993. At year-end
1993, the company's environmental remediation reserve was $746 million, mncluding $56 million
related to Superfund sites. Receivables of $18 million have been recorded for expected reimburse-
ments of expenditures for environmental cleanup.
Under provisions of the Superfund law, the Environmental Protecton Agency (EPA), as well as
certain state agencies, have designated Chevron a potentially responsible party (PRP) for remediation
of a portion of 223 hazardous waste sites, At year-end 1993, the company's cumulative share of costs
and settlements for approxmately 145 of these sites, for which payments or provisions have been
made in 1993 and prior years, was about $89 million, including a provision of $6 million during 1993.
For the remaining sites, investigations are not yet at a stage where the company is able to quantify a
probable liability or determine a range of possible exposure. The Superfund law provdes for joint
and several liability. Any future actions by the EPA and other regulatory agencies to require Chevron
to assume other responsible parties' costs at designated hazardous waste sites are not expected to have
a material effect on the company's consolidated financial position or liquidity.
Provisions are recorded for work at identified sites where an assessment or remediation plan has
been developed and for which costs can reasonably be estimated. It is likely the company will con-
tinue to incur additional charges for environmental programs relating to past operatons, These
future costs are indeterminable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contam-
ination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the deter-
mination of the company's liability in proportion to other responsible parties and the extent to which
such costs are recoverable from insurance or other sources. While the amounts of future costs may be
material to the company's results of operations in the period in which they are recognized, the com-
pany does not expect these costs to have a material effect on Chevron's consolidated financial position
or liquidity. Also, the company does not believe its obligations to make such expenditures have had or
will have any significant impact on the company's competitive position relative to other domestic or
responsibiiity includes maintaining the integrity and objectivity of financial data and the presentation of
Chrysler's results of operations and financial position in accordance wtth generally accepted accounting
principles. The financial statements irclude amounts that are based on management's best estimates
and judgrments.
Chrysler's financial statements have been audited by Deloitte & Touche, independent auditors.
Their audits were conducted in accordannce wnth generally accepted auditing standards and included
consideration of the internal control system and tests of transactions as part of plannning and per-
forrming ther audits.
Chrysler maintains a system of internal controls that provides reasonable assurance that its
records reflect ts transactions in all material respects and that signficant rmisuse or loss of assets wzill
be prevented. Mannagement believes the system of irrternal controls s adecuate to accomplish these
objectives on a continuuous basis. Zhrysler maintains a strong urternal auuditing program that indepen-
dently assesses the effectiveness of the internal controls and recommends possible improvements.
Management considers the General Auditor's and Deloitte & Touche's recommendations concerning
the system of internal controls and takes appropriate actions to respond to these recomrmendations.
The Board of Directors, acting through ts AAudit Committee composed solely of nonemployee
directors, is responsible for determining that management fulfiils its responsibilities in the preparation
of financial statements and the maintenance of internal controls. Ir fulfilling its responsibility, the Audit
Comrmttee recommends independent auditors to the Board of Directors for appointment by the
shareholders. The Committee also reviews the consolidated financial statements and adequacy of
internal controls. The Audit Committee meets regularly w:ith management, the General Auditor and
the independent auditors. Both the ndependent auditors and the General AAudtor have full and free
access to the Audit Commrttee, without management representatives present, to discuss the scope
and results of their audits and ther viewIs on the adequacy of rternal controls and the quality of
financial reporting.
It is the business philosophy of Chrysler Corporation and ts subsidiaries to obey the law: and to
require that ts employees conduct ther activities accordng to the highest standards of business
ethics. Managgement reinforces this philosophy by numerous actions, including issuing a Code of
Ethical Eehavior and maintarnmg a Business Practices Committee and a Business Practices Office to
supportcompliance withthe Corporation's policies.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Chrysler Corporation and consolidated
subsdianes as of December 31, 1993 ard 1992, and the related consolidated statements of earnings and cash
flow:S for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993. These financial statements are the
responsibiltv of the Company's management. Our responsibilty is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based onn our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted audting standards. Those stanndards
require that wze plarnn and perform the audtt to obtain reasonable assurarice about wzhether the finanncial state-
rments are free of material misstatermert. Ann audt mcludes exarmining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and dsclosures n the financial statements. Ann audit also includes assessing the accounting prin-
ciples used and sigrnificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial state-
rment presentation. We believe that our audtts provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Inn our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all matenal respects, the financial position of
Chrysler Corporation and consolidated subsidiannes as of December 31, 1993 ad 1992, and the results of their
operations and ther cash flow:s for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,1993, n confor-

As dscussed in the notes to the financial statements, the Company has adopted recently issued
Statements of Financial Accounting Standards and, accordngly, changed its methods of accounting for postre-
tirement benefts other than pensions and postemployment benefits ir 1993, arnd its method of accounting
for income taxes m 1992. In additon, the Company changed s method of accounting for the cost of special

generated by the reimhursement payment. As of December 31,
1993. 100.)0() units have been paid and 80(),000 units were
outstanding.
In 1985, the Company entered into Performance UUnit
Agreements, whereby certain officers were given the right to
receive cash awards based on the difference in the market
value of approsimately 2.2 million shares of the Company's
common stock at the measurement dates and the base price
of 85.l6, the market value as of ,January 2, 1985. As of
December 31, 1993, 78),()00 units have been paid and
approximately 1,4 million units were outstanding.
13. Pension Benefits
'T}e Company sponsors and/or contributes to pension plans
covering substantially all UU.S. employees and certain em-
ployees in international locations, The benefits are primarily
based on years of service and the employees' compensation
for certain periods during the last years of employment.
Pension costs are generally funded currently, subject to
regulatory funding limitations. The Company also sponsors
nonqualified, unfunded defined benefit plans for certain
officers and other employees, In addition, the Company and
its subsidiaries have various pension plans and other forms
of postretirement arrangements outside the United States.
The funded status for the Company's defined benefit plans is as follows (in millions ):
The assumptions used in computing the preceding information are as follows:
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As 1he resnlt of changes in U.S. tax law, the Company
was required to record charges for additional taxes and
tax-related expenses that reduced net income by approxi-
mately $51 million in 1993. The Company's effective tax
rate reflects the iavoralle U.S. tax treatment from manu-
facturing facilities in Puerto Rico that operate under a
negotiated exemption grant that expires December 3l,
2009, as well as the tax benefit derived from significant
operations outside the United States, which are taxed at
rates lower than the U.S, statutory rate of 35 percent.
Changes to U.S. ias law enacted in 1993 will limit the
utilization of the favorable tax treatment from operations
in Puerto Rico beginning in 1994, and will exert upward
pressure on the flompany's effective tax rate.
AAppropriate U.S. and international taxes have been
provided for earnings of subsidiary companies that are
expected to be remitted to the parent company, The cumu-
lative amount of unremitted earnings of international
subsidiaries that are epected to be indefinitely reinvested,
exclusive of amounts that, if remitted, would result in little
or no tax, is approximately $426 million at December 31,
1993. The taxes that would be paid upon remittance of
these earnings are approximately $149 million.

TThe changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of effects
of acquisitions and divestitures of businesses and unreal-
ized exchange gains/losses, are as follows (in millions ):

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ConAgra, Inc, and subsidiaries as of May 29, 1994 and
May 30, 1995, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, common stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the
three years (fifty-twolfifty-three weeks) in the period ended May 29, 1994, These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits,
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
ConAAgra, Inc, and subsidiaries as of May 29, 1994 and May 30, 1995, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years (fifty-twolfifty-three weeks) in the period ended May 29, 1994 in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles,
As discussed in Note 17, the consolidated financial statements give effect to the Companys adoption, effective June 1, 1992, of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106,''Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Oher Than Pensions,'
P r i n c p a 1 O ffi c e r s
Ihe principal officers of the company include, among oth-
ers, those listed on pages 28 and 29 of this report. The principal
officers are responsible for maintaining throughout the com-
pany a system of internal controls which protect the assets of
the company on a reasonable and economic basis, They also are
responsible for maintaining records which permit the prepara-
tion of financial statements that fairly present the financial
condition and results of operations of the company in accor-
dance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A u d t C o m m t t e e o f t h e B o a r d
The Audit Committee of ConAgras Board of Directors is
composed entirely of outside directors and recommends the
appointment of the companys independent public accoun-
tants, The Audit Committee meets regularly, and when
appropriate separately, with the independent public accoun-
tants, the internal auditors and financial management. Both
the independent public accountants and the internal auditors
have unrestricted access to the Audit Committee.
Fa ir Values of Financial Instruments
The Company believes that the book value of short-term
financial instruments approximates their fair value. For
these purposes, short-term is defined as any item that
matures, reprices, or represents a cash transaction between
willing parties within six months or less of the measurement
date. All financial instruments are considered to have a fair
value which approximates book value at May 29, 1994,
unless otherwise specified.
2. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
1994
At May 30, 1993, he Company had a 50% equity inter-
est in Australia Meat Holdings Pty. Ltd. (AMH), an
Australian beef processor. Effective the beginning of fiscal
1994, the Company increased its equity interest in AMH to
approximately 91%. The purchase price of this additional
interest was approximately $61 million. The accounts of
AMH have been included in the consolidated financial state-
ments since the beginning of fiscal 1994.
1993
During fiscal 1993, he Company acquired certain busi-
nesses, two of which have been recorded as poolings of
interests, the revenues and net earnings of which did not
significantly affect consolidated results.
1992
On July 11, 1991, Golden Valley Microwave Foods, Inc.
(Golden Valley) merged with ConAgra through an
exchange of .8514 of a share of ConAgra common stock for
each share of Golden Valley common stock. Golden Valley
is a leader in the development and marketing of foods
specifically for preparation in microwave ovens, Products
include popcorn, french fries, breakfast foods and sand-
wiches distributed through vending industry, mass
merchandising outlets and grocery stores, ConAgra issued
15.0 million shares of common stock for Golden Valleys
18.8 million shares of common stock and assumed out-
standing options for approximately 1.0 million shares of
ConAgra common stock, In addition, outstanding warrants
for 0.6 million shares of Golden Valley stock were con-
verted to warrants to purchase 0.5 million shares of
ConAgra common stock at $40.52 per share. The transac-
tion has been accounted for as a pooling of interests, The
exchange ratio and share amounts above have been revised
to reflect ConAgras 3-for-2 stock split on December 2,
1991. The historical financial statements of the Company
have been restated to give effect to the acquisition as though
the companies had operated together from the beginning of
the earliest period presented.
On [anuary 2, 1992, all of the outstanding capital stock
of Arrow Industries, Inc. was exchanged for 5,250,000
shares of ConAgra common stock in a transaction
accounted for as a pooling of interests, Financial informa-
tion for periods prior to this transaction has not been
restated because of immateriality and, accordingly, results of
operations have been included since the date of acquisition.
3. RECEIVABLES
During September 1990, he Company entered into
agreements to sell, for a period of up to five years, undivided
participation interests in designated pools of receivables,
with limited recourse, in an amount not to exceed $400 mil-
lion at any one time. During each April of 1994 and 1993,
the agreement was temporarily increased to $500 million for
a period of up to six months, at which time it automatically
reduces to the original $400 million. Participation interests
in new receivables may be sold as collections reduce previ-
ously sold participation interests, The participation interests
are sold at a discount which is included in Selling.
Administrative and General Expenses in the consolidated
statements of earnings, In connection with this transaction,
the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements
with two money center bank counterparties which effec-
tively fix the discount rate on $400 million of such
participation interests at 9.4% for five years, The estimated
fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was an obliga-
tion of $21.5 million as of May 29, 1994. Gross proceeds
from the sales were approximately $500 million as of May
29, 1994 and May 30, 1993.
Receivables of Monfort Finance Company include notes
receivable of approximately $254 million and $273 million at
May 29, 1994 and May 30, 1993, respectively.
4, INVENTORIES
The major classes of inventories are as follows:
Under the long-term credit facility indicated in Note 7, at
May 29, 1994, he Company may borrow up to $500 million
through October 14, 1998.
The subordinated notes of Geldermann, Inc., a wholly
owned subsidiary, are placed with banks and are subordi-
nated to the claims of present and future general creditors,
The loans mature on [uly 31, 1995, and bear interest on a
floating rate basis (7.313% at May 29, 1994). This is at a
premium over the one-month LIBOR rate. The loan agree-
ments stipulate that these loans cannot be repaid if such
repayment would cause Geldermann, Inc. not to meet its
regulatory capital requirements. The Company does not
guarantee Geldermann, Inc. borrowings.
The most restrictive note agreements (the revolving
credit facilities and certain privately placed long-term debt)
provide that the lenders may require the Company to repay
the debt if (based on terms as defined in the agreements)
Consolidated Funded Debt exceeds 60% of Consolidated
Capital Base or if Fised Charges coverage is less than 1.75
to 1.0.
Net interest expense consists of:
Included above is short-term interest expense of financial
businesses of $13.7 million, $10.2 million and $13.0 million
in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
Short-term debt interest expense of $12.7 million, $14.6
million and $17.1 million in fiscal 1994, 1995 and 1992,
respectively, incurred to finance hedged inventories, has been
charged to cost of goods sold.
Net interest paid was $242.1 million, $239.5 million and
$269.7 million in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
The carrying amount of long-term debt (including current
installments) was $2,327.5 million as of May 29, 1994.
Based on current market rates primarily provided by outside
investment bankers, the fair value of this debt was estimated
at $2,431.3 million. The Companys long-term debt is gener-
ally not callable until maturity.
9, OTHER NONCURRENT LABILITIES
Other noncurrent liabilities consist of estimated liabilities
of Beatrice Company (acquired in fiscal 1991), estimated
postretirement health care and pension benefits, and deferred
income tax credits, as follows:
In fiscal 1992 and 1993, he Company made cash pay-
ments to the Internal Revenue Service relating to certain
of the disputed income tax liabilities of the Beatrice
Companies. These cash payments, which aggregated
$139 million in fiscal 1993 and $150 million in fiscal
1992, are recoverable to the extent that the Company is
successful in resolving the disputed issues for an amount
less than paid (see Note 16). The payments were made to
mitigate tuture interest expense associated with the dis-
puted income taxes, and have been netted against the
related noncurrent liabilities.
10. PREFERRED SECURITIES OF SUBSIDARY COMPANY
In April 1994, ConAgra Capital, L.C., an indirectly
wholly owned finance subsidiary of ConAgra, Inc., issued
4.0 million 9% Series A Cumulative Preferred Securities
(Class A Securities) at a price of $25 per security.
Subsequent to year end, during June 1994, Congra
Capital, L.C., issued 7.0 million Series B Adjustable Rate
Cumulative Preferred Securities (Class B Securities) at a
price of $25 per security. ConAgra Capital, IL.C. loaned the
net proceeds to ConAgra, Inc, to be used for general corpo-
rate purposes,
Dividends on the Class A Securities at the rate of 9% per
annum are payable monthly commencing May 51, 1994,
Dividends on the Class B Securities are payable monthly
commencing on June 50, 1994 at a rate per annum which
is adjusted quarterly to 95% of the highest of three U.S.
Treasury security indices, The dividend rate on the Class B
Securities has a floor of 5.0% and a ceiling of 10.5% per
annum and was established pursuant to the formula at
7.06% for the quarterly period ending August 31, 1994,
The Class A Securities and Class B Securities are guaran-
teed on a limited basis by ConAgra, Inc and, in certain
limited circumstances, are exchangeable for debt securities
of ConAgra, Inc. The Class A and Class B Securities are
redeemable at the option of ConAgra Capital, L.C. (with
ConAgra, Inc.s consent) in whole or in part, on or after
May 31, 1999 with respect to Class A Securities and June
30, 1999 with respect to Class B Securities, at $25 per secu-
rity plus accumulated and unpaid dividends to the date
fised for redemption.
Deferred tax assets have been reduced by a valuation
allowance as realization of some portion of these future tax
benefits is subject to significant uncertainties, Favorable reso-
lution of these uncertainties would result in a reduction in the
valuation allowance which would principally reduce goodwill.
Income taxes paid were $205.9 million, $194.5 million and
$151.6 million in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
15. COMMITMENTS
Certain facilities and transportation equipment are leased
under agreements expiring at various dates during the next
fourteen years. Management expects that in the normal course
of business, leases that expire will be renewed or replaced by
other leases. Substantially all leases require payment of prop-
erty taxes, insurance and maintenance costs in addition to
rental payments.
A summary of rent expense charged to operations follows:
In connection with its trading activities, the Company
had letters of credit and performance bonds outstanding at
May 29, 1994, aggregating approsimately $581.9 million.
16. CONTINGENCIES
With respect to operations of the Company excluding
the transaction discussed below, there was no litigation at
May 29, 1994 which, in the opinion of management.
would have a material adverse effect on the financial posi-
tion of the Company.
On August 14, 1990, ConAgra acquired Beatrice
Company. The Beatrice businesses and its former subsidiaries
(Subsidiaries) are engaged in various litigation proceedings
incident to their respective businesses and in various environ-
mental and other matters, Beatrice and various of its
Subsidiaries have agreed to indemnify divested businesses or
the purchasers thereof for various legal proceedings and tax
matters, The federal income tax returns of Beatrice and its
predecessors for the fiscal years ended 1985 through 1987
have been audited by the Internal Revenue Service and a
report has been issued. The findings contained in the examin-
ing agents report have been timely protested and negotiations
with the Appellate Division of the Internal Revenue Service
are under way in an attempt to resolve disputed items.
Disputed items being negotiated with the Appellate Division
of the Internal Revenue Service include proposed deficiencies
relating to previously filed carryback claims to fiscal years
ended prior to 1985 (principally fiscal years ended 1982
through 1984). Additionally, the federal income tax returns
of Beatrice and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the fiscal years
ended 1988 and 1989, have been audited by the Internal
Revenue Service and a report has been issued. Management
intends to protest the unagreed findings of the examining
agents report and to negotiate disputed items with the
Appellate Division of the Internal Revenue Service. Various
state tax authorities are also examining tax returns of Beatrice
and its predecessors for prior taxable years, including, in the
case of one state, years back to fiscal 1978. It is expected that
additional claims will be asserted for additional taxes. It is not
possible at this time to determine the ultimate liabilities that
may arise from these matters which at any given point in time
will be at various stages of administrative and legal proceed-
ings and will aggregate hundreds of millions of dollars.
Substantial reserves for these matters have been established
and are reflected as liabilities on the Subsidiaries balance
sheets, The liabilities include accrued interest on the tax
claims, After taking into account liabilities that have been
recorded and payments made, management is of the opinion
that the disposition of the above matters will not have a mate-
rial adverse effect on ConAgras financial condition, results of
operations or liquidity.

A Special Charge and Aecouunting; Chamge
The second quarter of 1993 included a special pretax charge of
$180 by Marion Merrell Dow Inc. This special charge reflected
Marion Merrell Dows plans to reduce its work force in line with
current business conditions and redesign its U.S, business organiza-
tion.'The Company holds an interest in Marion Merrell Dow Inc.
of approximately 72 percent.
During de fourth quarter of 1992, opportunities were identi-
fied to streamline the Company and a special pretax charge of $453
was taken, This charge reflected asset write-offs and write-downs,
plant shutdowns, divestitures and the consolidation of a variety of
business activities globally, Included were costs related to work
force reductions associated with these activities,
The fourth quarter of 1991 included a special pretas charge of
$370 for shutdown and divestiture of a variety of fcilities and busi-
ness activities primarily in basic chemicals and plastics, The deci-
sion to take this special charge was consistent with Dows strategy
to divert into specialties, Actions contemplated by the 1992 and
1991 special charges are substantially complete, with no significant
adjustments required to the estimates,
Efective December 31, 1993, he Company adopted FASB
Statement No. 115 (Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities'). This statement requires certain invest-
ments in debt and equity securities to be classified as either
Trading, Available-for-Sale, or Held-to-Maturity. Investments clas-
sified as lrading are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and
losses included in income. Investments classified as Available-for-
Sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses
recorded in a separate component of stockholders' equity.
Investments classified as Held-to-Maturity are recorded at amor-
tized cost. The impact on net income for the year was not material.
The effect of the change was an increase to stockholders' equity of
$107. Prior year amounts were not restated.
The Company will adopt FASB Statement No. 112
('Employers Accounting for Postemployment Benefits') in 1994,
and anticipates that the financial impact will not be material.
Effective January 1, 1992, Dow adopted FASB Statement
No. 106 ('Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Odher Than Pensions'), FASB Statement No. 107 ('Disclosures
about Fair Value of Financial Instruments') and FASB Statement
No. 109 (Accounting for Income lases'). Financial statements
prior to 1992 were not restated.
FASB Statement No. 106 requires employers to recognize the
cost of certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to
retirees and their dependents as a liability during the employees'
active years of service. In making the transition to adopt this
required accounting standard, a charge of $994or $5.66 per share
was made against 1992 net income. This change also had the effect
of increasing 1992 pretax operating expenses from $58 (under the
previous accounting method) to $165.
FASB Statement No. 109 changes the method of accounting
for income taxes, The favorable cumulative effect of implementation
was $229 or 84 cents per share. The credit for deferred income taxes
for 1992 would have been $191 if prepared in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 11 instead of he
$295 recorded under FASB Statement No. 109.
The $229 favorable impact, together with he $994charge
mentioned above, are shown as a net cumulative charge of $765
against 1992 net income.

R Pension Plans and Other Pestemployment Bennefits
The Company has defined benefit pension plans which cover
employees in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries, The
Companys funding policy is to contribute annually, at a rate that is
intended to approximate a level percentage of compensation for the
covered employees, to those plans where pension laws and eco-
nomics either require or encourage funding.
The U.S. funded plan is the largest plan, Its benefits are based
on length of service and the employees three-highest consecutive
years of compensation. The weighted average discount rate and rate
of increase in future compensation levels used in determining the
actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligations were
7.25 and 5.5 percent, respectively, for 1993 and 8.25 and 6 per-
cent, respectively, for 1992, The assumed long-term rate of return
on assets was % percent for 1995 and 9 percent for 1992.
All other pension plans used assumptions in determining the
actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligations that are
consistent with (but not identical to) those of the U.S. plan.
The funded status of fully funded, significant defined benefit
plans for the Company was as follows:
Defined contribution plans cover employees in Australia, New
ZZealand, Spain, the United Kingdom and some U.S. subsidiaries,
In addition, employees in the U.S, are eligible to participate in
defined contribution plans (Employee Savings Plans) by contribut-
ing a portion of their compensation, The Company matches com-
pensation, depending on Company profit levels, Contributions
charged to income for defined contribution plans were $92 in
1993, $98 in 1992 and $89 in 1991.
In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company pro-
vides certain health care and life insurance benefits to retired
employees, As discussed in Note A, the Company adopted FASB
Statement No. 106 effective ]anuary 1, 1992. Previously, the
Company recognized the cost of providing these benefits as the
benefits were paid. Ihese pretax costs amounted to $53 in 1991.
The Company continues to fund most of the cost of these medical
and life insurance benefits in the year incurred.
The U.S. plan covering the parentcompany is the largest plan.
It provides medical and life insurance benefits including hospital,
physicians' services and major medical expense benefits and life
insurance benefits. The plan provides benefits supplemental to
Medicare after retirees are eligible for these benefits The cost of
these benefits are shared by the Company and the retiree, with the
Company portion increasing as the retiree has increased years of
credited service. The Company has the ability to change these
benefits at any time.
Effective October 1993, he Company amended itshealth
benefits plan in the U.S. to cap the cost absorbed by the Company
at approximately twice the 1995 cost per person for employees who
retire after December 31, 1993. The effect of this amendment was
to reduce the December 31, 1995 accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation by $327. It also reduced the net periodicpostre-
tirement cost by $21 fsr 1995 and is estimated to reduce this cost
for 1994by approximately $83.

Essex A.G., a Swiss company, which supplies European automobile
manufacturers with proprietary specialy products. The 1992 and
1991 amounts also include the Dowell Schlumberger companies,
sold in January 1993.
The Companys equity investment in these companies was
$491 and $959 in 1995 and 1992, respectively, and its equity por-
tion of earnings loss) was $(138), $7 and $117in 1993, 1992 and
1991, respectively. The Companys equity investment was reduced
significantly in 1993 due to the sale of its holding in Dowell
Schlumberger (see Note C) and the charge taken by Dow Corning
Corporation related to breast implant litigation (see Note O).

automotive and electrical components. We also purchased Ciba-Geigy's
PBT (polybutylene terephthalate) polyester business in Germany, which
strengthens our global position in polyester resins and electrical mar-
kets. Except for ''Corian'' solid surface material, used in applications
such as sinks and countertops, we sold our acrylics business to ICl as
part of our strategy of focusing resources on those businesses in which
we have unique strengths and the opportunity for global growth.
A combination of cost-reduction programs and improving market
conditions, primarily in the United States, brought gains late in the year.

Sales were up less than 1 percent as increased sales in the United
States were essentially offset by lower sales in other regions. A world-
wide 5 percent volume increase was offset by lower prices resulting
principally from the currency exchange effects of a stronger dollar.

In the first quarter the company sold its worldwide connector
systems business to Hicks, Muse and Company, as part of its strategy
for divestiture of non-core businesses. Proceeds were about $270
million, with negligible impact on earnings.
+ At mid-year, DuPont and lmperial Chemical Industries Ltd. (!Cl)
completed transactions in which DuPont acquired for about $4/5 mil-
lion ICl's worldwide fibers business and lCl acquited for $280 million
DuPont's acrylics business, excluding 'Corian''. The purchase
sttengthens the company's nylon market position, garticularly n
Europe, where most of ICl's business was based. The acrylcs sale
had minimal earnings impact.
In the third quarter, the company announced additional restructur-
ngs and ecorded after-tax charges of $1.3 billion, grincipally for
asset write-offs, the most significant of which were for goodwill.
technology and tationalization of excess capacity in the printing and
publishing businesses.
In the fourth quarter, the company completed sales of the
Remington Arms Company and DuPont Canada's 'Sclair'' polyethyl-
ene business. A net after-tax gain of $52 mllon was recorded.
Proceeds of $300 million from the Remington sale were used primari-
ly to retire debt.
+ Also in the fourth quarter, the company took an additional $126
million after-tax charge n connection with the 'Benlate'' DF 50 fungi-
cide recall. This additional accrual for 'Benlate'' DF 50 updates the
estimate of costs based on recent experience of court
trials, review of case histories and rate of spending on litigation
Adverse changes in estimates for these costs could result in addition-
al future charges.
isestructturing
During 1993, the company announced a number of steps for strategic
resttucturing, primarily for improving competitiveness in global mar-
kets, but also to streamline internal organitations and eliminate large
business sectors in favor of smaller, sttategic business units.
Restucturing charges of $1,295 million, after taxes, were taken in the
third quarter. These include $375 million for employee separation
costs telated to the elimination of about 9,000 positions worldwide.
Other charges were for wrte-offs, grincipally of goodwill and technol-
ogy arising ftom printing and publishing acquisitions in the late
1980's, various facilities shutdowns and asset write-downs. The
latter mncluded write-downs for certain North American petroleum-
producing properties sold in the fourth quarter, polymer production
lines in LaPorte, Texas, nylon textile production lines in Martinsville,
Virginia, and polyester filament production lines in Cooper River,
South Carolina. It s estimated that 1994 earnmgs will eflect
more than $300 million of after-tax cost savings telated to this
resttucturing.
Saes
Sales n 1993 were $37.1 billion, down 2 percent from 1992 Sales in
the Petroleum segment and the combination of all other segments
were both about 2 percent below 1992. Lower sales were principally
due to lower prices, partly offset by higher volumes. The sales decline
for the combined Chemicals, Fibers, Polymers, and Diversified
Businesses segments reflects 4 percent lower sales outside of the
Unted States, largely due to adverse exchange effects from a
stronger dollar, partly offset by higher volume. After adjusting for the
divestiture of the connector systems business, U.S. sales were up
percent, eflecting slightly higher volume and prices. Fibers had
mcreased sales esulting ftom the acquisition of ICl's nylon business,
and Polymers had increased sales to the U S. automotive industry.
Sales n 1992 were $37.8 billion, 2 percent below 1991, principally
reflecting the absence of sales ftom the coal business, which has
been accounted for under the equity method since the beginning of
1992 After adjusting for the coal business, sales were up 2 percent,
principally eflecting higher volumes worldwide. Currency exchange
rates had no significant effect on the change in sales.
Over the last three years, the company's ElTR exceeded the U.S.
statutory tate of 35% in 1993, and 34% n 1992 and 1991, principally
because of the higher tax rates associated with petroleum production
operations outside the United States. Ihe 1993 ElTR decreased about
5 percentage points from the prior year, principally reflecting a lower
effective tax rate in Petroleum operations and the $265 million tax
benefit described above, partly offset by an increased proportion of
higher-taxed Petroleum earnings. The decrease in the 1992 E!TR
versus 1991, eflected a lower proportion of higher-taxed Petroleum
earnings due to a reduced level of earnings in that segment, partly
offset by an increase in the EITR fom adoption of SFAS No. 109.

surrendered, retired, sold or otherwise disposed of, the assets
involved determine if gain or loss s recognized, or the gross
carrying value is charged to accumulated depreciation, depletion
and amortization and any salvage or other recovery therefrom is
credited to accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization.
Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations; eplacements
and betterments are capitalized.
Oil and Gas Properties
The company's exploration and production activities are accounted
for under the successful-efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved
properties are capitalized, and mpairment of those properties, which
are individually insignificant, is provided for by amortizing the cost
thereof based on past experience and the estimated holding period.
Geological, geophysical and delay rental costs are expensed as
incurred. Costs of exploratory dry holes are expensed as the wells are
determined to be dry. Costs of productive properties, production and
support equipment, and development costs are capitalized and
amortized on a unit-of-production basis.
Intangible Assets
ldentifiable intangible assets such as purchased patents and
trademarks are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated
useful lives Goodwill is amortized over periods up to 40 years on the
sttaight-line method.
Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures
Accruals for environmental matters are recorded in operating
expenses when it is probable that a liability has been incurred
and the amount of the liability can be teasonably estimated. Accrued
liabilities are exclusive of claims against third parties and are not
discounted.
ln general, costs related to environmental remediation are
charged to expense. Environmental costs are capitalized if the
costs increase the value of the property and/or mitigate or prevent
contamination from future operations.
Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes for 1993 and 1992 has been
determined under SFAS No. 109, which requites use of the asset and
liability approach to accounting for income taxes Under that
approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences
expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
are recovered or paid. Ihe provision for income taxes tepresents
income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in
deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result fom differences
between the financial and tax bases of the company's assets and
liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws

New Accounting Standards
In November 1992, he Financial Accounting Standards Board
('FASB') issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 112 (SFAS 112'),''Employers Accouning for
Postemployment Benefits,' which requires companies to account
for employee benefits on an accrual basis for periods when
employees are no longer actively employed but have not yet
reached retirement. The effect on the companys financial state-
ments was not material.
In May 1993, de FASB issued SFAS 114,'Accounting by
Creditors for Impairment of a Loan,' The standard requires that
impaired loans be measured based on the present value of expected
future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate.
The company does not plan to adopt this standard until
January 1, 1995, and the effect is not expected to be material.
In May 1993, de FASB issued SFAS 115,''Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.' The standard
establishes financial accounting and reporting requirements for
investments in equity securities (excluding those accounted for
under the equity method and investments in consolidated
subsidiaries) dhat have readily determinable fair values and for all
investments in debt securities. The company has adopted this
standard effective [anuary 1, 1994, and the effect is not expected
to be material.
MANAGEMENTS FINANCAL RESPONSIBILTY
Management is responsible for the preparation of the companys
financial statements and the other financial information in this
report. This responsibility includes maintaining the integrity and
objectivity of the financial records and the presentation of the
companys financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.
The company maintains an internal control structure intended
to provide, among other things, reasonable assurance that its
records include the transactions of its operations in all material
respects and to provide protection against significant misuse or
loss of company assets, The internal control structure is supported
by a staff of internal auditors who employ thorough auditing
programs, by careful selection and training of financial manage-
ment personnel, and by written procedures that communicate the
details of the internal control structure to the companys world-
wide activities.
The companys financial statements have been audited by A
Coopers S Lybrand, independent certified public accountants.
Their audit was conducted in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards which included consideration of the companys
internal control structure. The Report of Independent Accoun-
tants appears on page 45.
The Board of Directors, acting drough its Audit Committee
composed solely of directors who are not employees of the
company, is responsible for determining that management flfill
its responsibilities in the preparation of financial statements and
the financial control of operations. The Audit Committee
appoints the independent accountants, subject to ratification by
the stockholders. It meets regularly with management, internal
auditors, and independent accountants, The independent
accountants have full and free access to the Audit Committee and
meet with it to discuss their audit work, the companys internal
controls, and financial reporting matters,
Some have argued that single-product busi-
nesses have a focus that gives them an advantage
oVer muultibusiness companies like our own -
and perhaps they would have, but only if we ne-
glect our own overriding advantage: the ability
to share the ideas that are the result of wide and
rich input from a multitude of global sources,
GE businesses share technology, design,
COmpensation and personnel evaluation systems,
manufacturing practices, and customer and
country knowledge, Gas Turbines shares manu-
facturing technology with Aircraft Engines;
Motors and Transportation Systems work
together on new locomotive propulsion systems;
Lighting and Medical Systems collaborate to
improve x-ray tube processes; and GE Capital
provides innovative financing packages that help
all our businesses around the globe. These are
just a few of the thousands of examples of how
our businesses work together. Supporting all this
is a management system that fosters and rewards
this sharing and teamwork, and, increasingly, a
culture that makes it reflexive and natural at
every level and corner of our Company.
When we began our pursuit of boundaryless-
ness, we believed that the boundaries just de-
scribed - the walls, if you will- would be the
most difficult to eliminate, while the hierarchical
management layers would be the easiest because
they could simply be taken out by directive. The
big, visible layers at the top of the Company -
Sectors, Groups and the like - were easy to get
rid of, but deeper within the businesses, the
layers - formal and informal - are not only
hard to remove, they are often hard to find, The
compulsion to manage, to control, to direct, is a
powerful one, reinforced by a century-old tradi-
tion at GE of measuring one's self-worth by how
many people ''work for you'' and whether or not
the word ''manager'' appears in your title. The
highest compliment you could give GE managers
a few years ago was to say they were ''on top of
things'' or had gotten ''their arms around them.'
These techniques, more useful in tackling people
than coaching them, are difficult to get rid of.
What we are looking for today at GE are lead-
ers at every level who can energize, excite and
coach rather than enervate, depress and control,
And never has this atmosphere been more criti-
cal. Today, everyone must be engaged if we are to
win. The kind of people we need in this Company
are those unwilling to ''put in their time' in the
bowels of the bureaucracy, or grunt along under
the heel of some autocrat for years, before they get
a chance to make decisions, try something and
be rewarded in their souls as well as their wallets,
In some difficult cases this means parting
company with some impressive people - Heis-
man Irophy candidates, to use an American
football expression - who won't block for others
or play as part of a team. Their debilitating effect
on the team can outweigh the benefits of their
individual talent. Leaders at GE are now sub-
ject to what we call a 360' evaluation, meaning
thev are rated not just by those above them, but
by their peers and their subordinates as well,
This has become a powerful tool for detecting
and changing those who ''smile up and kick
down,''To be blunt, the two quickest ways to
part company with GE are, one, to commit an
integrity violation, or, two, to be a controlling,
19993 was one of the most dynamic years in GE
LLighting's history, We had close to double-digit
earnings growth, before restructuring costs, on
stable revenues as we continued global expansion
and development of hhigh-technology products
for increased energy efficiency and light quality,
We again made major gains in productivity, with
increased employee involvement in cycle-time
reductions and quality enhancements, Oyer the
past two vears, we have cut our product develop-
ment-to-market cycle by half, and we aim to re-
duce this cycle by an additional 5(0%.
Ouur technology efforts continue to be focused
on the fastest-growing energy-saving lighting
products, including the popular compact fluores-
cents, Our investment in technology produced a
significant number of new products- up 75%
in 1993. During the past five years, we added
more than 300 types of energy-saving lamps, and
our sales of these rose nearlv 200%. each year.
Kev to this achievement is the involvement of
global program teams located in our major mar-
kets, Io accelerate top-line growth in consumer,
commercial and industrial markets, we formed a
New Product Ventures organization to develop
and sell specialty lighting products, The team's
goal is to be fast, flexible and quick to market.
Equally significant to our 1993 success was
continued strategic globalization. We agreed to
form a joint venture in China, GE [iabao I,ight-
ing Gommpany, Ltd., to manufacture, distribute
and sell a full line of lighting products in Chi-
na's fast-growing, $550 million lighting market.
We also strengthened our position in [apan
with the start-up of Hitachi GE Lighting, I.td.
This jointventure has introduced 75 different
lamp types to the [apanese market, providing
major export opportunities for GE plants in
North America and Europe. The [V now serves
the $2 billion ]apanese lighting market through
some 100 distributors, who have more than 400
offices and supply about 10,000 Hitachi retail
outlets, In India, our GE Apar Lighting venture
continued to expand with investments in new fa-
cilities and in the only ''ribbon'' glassmaking
equipment in India or Southeast Asia, Additional
ventures in Thailand and Indonesia position us
as a clear leader in this fast-growing region.

GECS allowance for losses on financing receivables repre-
sented 2.63% of total financing receivables at year-end
1993 and 1992. The allowance for small-balance receiv-
ables is determined principally on the basis of actual ex-
perience during the preceding three years, Further allow-
ances are provided to reflect management's judgment of
additional loss potential. For other receivables, principally
the larger loans and leases, the allowance for losses is de-
termined primarily on the basis of management's judg-
ment of net loss potential, including specific allowances
for known troubled accounts, The table below shows the ac-
tivity in theallowance for losses on financing receivables
during each of the past three years,
All accounts or portions thereof deemed to be uncollec-
tible or to require an excessive collection cost are written
off to the allowance for losses, Small-balance accounts are
progressively written down (from 10% when more than
three months delinquent to 100% when 9-12 months
delinquent) to record the balances at estimated realizable
value, If at any time during that period an account is
judged to be uncollectible, such as in the case of a bank-
ruptcy, the uncollectible balance is written off. Large-
balance accounts are reviewed at least quarterly, and those
accounts that are more than three months delinquentare
written down, if necessary, to record the balances at esti-
mated realizable value. Amounts written off in 1993 were
approximately 1,46% of average financing receivables
outstanding during the year, compared with 1.58% and
1.87% of average financing receivables outstanding dur-
ing 1992 and 1991, respectively.

International Automotive 0perations
GMs International Automotive Operations (I0)
were profitable in 1993 and 1992, although
results trailed the high profit levels achieved
in 191. Income of I0 before accounting changes
was $1,224.9 million in 1993 versus $1,514.5
million in 1992 and $1,468.7 million in 1991.
Results in 1993 reflected record sales and prof
its in GMs Latin American Operations (AO).
Europe remained profitable despite an extremely
difficult economic climate, but profits were below
1992 levels. The decline in 1995 earnings was
primarily attributable to a European car market
decline of 16.5%.
During 1993, Europes vehicle unit deliveries
declined by 10.5%, although GM increased its
car and truck market share to 12.6 in 1995
from 1lL8% in 1992 and 11L5 in 1991L By
increasing its overall passenger car market share
to 15.4 in 1995, up from 12.7 in 1992, and
12.2% in 1991, GM maintained second place
among all manufacturers of passenger cars in
Western Europe. This was the fifth straight year
of increased market share for Opel/Vauxhall in
Western Europe. The technically identical Opel/
Vauxhall model range maintained its number
one position in the Western European car markt
in 1993. Opels market share increased in 15
different countries. The successful launch of
the new Corsa attributed significantly to this
favorable market share development, while the
Astra was again GMs largest selling model line
in Europe, maintaining its position as the second-
bestselling car in Europe.
Progress was made in restructuring Saabs
operations during 1995. Improvements in cost
efficiency and productivity ensured a successful
launch in 1993 of the new Saab 900, Saab
Automobile ABs first all-new product since the
joint venture company was established in 1990.
LAOs performance exceeded all previous
records on sales and financial fronts. By capital-
izing on market openings throughout the region,
with all-time record deliveries of over 402,000
units (up 28% vs. 1992), GM was able to
maintain its market share at 18%. Led by GM
do Brasils sales increase (i5), LO was able
to post all-time record net income and operating
profits and records were also established in GM
operations in both Venezuela and Colombia.
GM Chile also achieved its second best year in
history LO is poised for the future as it re-
established its manufcturing presence in Argentina
to take advantage of market growth. All this
was accomplished amidst substantial political
uncertainty and increased competitive pressures
from Eastern European and Asian entries.
While attaining an 18% increase in unit
deliveries in 1992 (versus 1991) to $l4,000
units, GM continued to strengthen its inancial
position in Latin America by posting record
operating profit as well. The region also benefited
from a relatively low effective tax rate in 1993.
Improved sales in Brazil, as well as record
sales in Chile and Ecuador, combined with
significant year- to-year increases in Venezuela,
Colombia, and Argentina, all contributed to GMs
18.0 regional market share- its highest over-
seas. Sustained levels of sales and profitability
in Latin America are highly dependent upon
economic and political conditions in the region.
In the Asia-Pacific region, financial perfor-
mance was favorable despite substantial new
business development costs incurred in expand-
ing GMs operations in the rapid-growth econo-
mies of China, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia. In
Japan, the re-launch of Opel products in
partnership with Yanase & Company resulted in
record sales. In Taiwan, local assembly of the
very popular Opel Astra commenced in May 1993
and, in September, a joint venture was formed
in Indonesia, whhere assembly of Opel models
is planned for 1994. The VR Commodore
launched in mid-199 by GM Holdens was
named Car of the Ycar in Australia.
GMAC
GMAC, in its role as a partner with General
Motors and GM dealers, serves the financing
and insurance needs of GM customers.
Reference should be made to the condensed
GMAC financial statements included in Note 12
to the Financial Statements.
Consolidated net income of GMAC for 1993
totaled $981.1 million, an increase of $45.0
million over 1992.
Earnings for 1992 reflect an unfavorable
cumulative effect of an accounting change related
to implementation of SFcS No. 106 which reduced
1992 net income by $282.6 million. Excluding the
nonrecurring impact ofSEeS No. 106, GMACs 1903
earnings declined by $2%.6 million year to year
Net income of $1,369.7 million in 1991
included a $51.5 million fvorable cumulative
effect of an accounting change relative to imple-
mentation of SES No. l09, Acounting or Income
Taxes, and a $170.9 million after-tax special
wholesale loss provision. Exluding special items,
1992 income was $1,218.7 million compared to
S1,2091 million in 1991.
Net income from financing operations totaled
S790.6 million in 1993, compared with $1,0l1.6
million in 192, excluding the cumulative impact
of SFS No. 106. The decrease in earnings in
1995 is primarily attributable to lower asset
levels and tighter net interest rate margins in
North America (net of depreciation expense on
operating lease vehicles). partially offset by
higher earnings outside North America.
Net income fom inancing operations in 1992
compared favorably with 1991 levels of $865.9
million (excluding the cumulative impact of
SEcS No. 109) due to a special whholesale loss
provision reported in 1991.
Total financing revenue was $8,752.0 million
for 1993. $1,650.1 million below 1992 amounts.
Revenue from retail and lease financing was
$3;67i million, down 55.5%, while revenue
from leasing operations increased 97% to
$3I870.9 million. Financing revenue from
whholesale and term loans declined $159 5
million from 1992 levels.
Total inancing revenue amounted to $10,402.1
million in 1992, a 6.7% decrease from 1991.
Revenue from retail and lease financing was
$5;5070 million, down 20.5%, whtile revenue
from leasing operations increased 29.2% to
$3;5279 million. Financing revenue from whole-
sale and term loans remained relatively stable
at $1,%672 million.
Insurance premiums earned by Motors Insur-
ance Corporation totaling $l,107 2 million
decreased $52.5 million and $80.5 million
from 1992 and 1991 levels, respectively
Interest and discount expense declined 19(0%
to $4,721L2 million in 1993 and l.8% to $5,828.6
million in 92 as a result of the continued down-
ward trend in US. interest rates and the lower
level of borrowings. Net interest margin (including
depreciation expense) declined $815.1 million
to $1,328.8 million in 1993 and $262.5 million
to $2,1459 million in 1992, reflecting lower
earning asset levels attributable to GMACs asset
securitization strategy and narrowing spreads
in the US. This was partially offset by wider
spreads in GMACs international operations.
Total earning assets of GMAC were $74788
million at December 51, 1993, down 14.2% from
yearend 192. The reduced level of earning assets
reflects lower financing levels of new GM cars
and trucks in the U.S. in 1993, as well as the
sales of receivables. During 1993 and 1992,
GMAC sold and securitited finance receivables
with principal amounting to $15.6 hillion and
$12.0 billion, respectively
In the ULS., GMAC financed 28% of new GM
vehicles delivered by GM dealers during 1995,
down 5 percentage points rom 1992 and
7 percentage points from 1991.
GMACs total borrowings were $62.773.2
million at December 1, 1993 a 15.8% decrease
from the prior yearend. Approximately 80.0'
of 1993 horrowings supported United States
operations.
The provision for financing losses amounted
to $%00.8 million in 1995; a decrease of
s70.2 million and s7471 million from 1992
and 1991, respectively, reflecting a lower level
of finance receivables outstanding, a $275 mil-
lion pre-tax nonrecurring special wholesale loss
provision in 1991, and better loss performance
trends in all segments of GMACs businesses.
EDS
EDS achieved record earnings or the eighth con-
secutie year, reflecting continued strong perfor-
mance in its existing businesses as well as growth
in new markets. Separate consolidated net income
increased 15.9% to $724.0 million in 1993 and
16.1% to $635.5 million in 1992 over $5475
million in 1991. Earnings per share attributable
to Class E common stock were $1.51 in 193
and $1.53 in 1992, up from $1L17 before the
cumulative effect of an accounting change in
1991, and are based on the Available Separate
Consolidated Net Income of EDS (described in
Note 9 to the Financial Statements).
EDS is a world leader in systems integra-
tion and communications services. Revenues from
sources outside GM and its affiliates rose 7
in 1993 to $5,238.1 million and %0.3% in 1N892
to $4,870.4 million and comprised 61.2% and
593%, respectively, of all EDS revenues. In addi-
tion, EDS continued to assist GM in a variety of
re-engineering processes being implemented in
the Corporations fctories and offices.
EDS financial statements do not include the
amortization of the $2,1795 million initial cost
to GM of EDS customer contracts, computer soft-
ware programs, and other intangible assets,
including goodwill, arising from the acquisition
of EDS by GM in 1984. This cost, plus the
$345.2 million cost of oontingent notes purchased
in 1986, less certain income tax benefits, was
assigned principally to intangible assets, includ-
ing goodwill, and is being amortized by GM over
the estimated useful lives of the assets acquired.
Such amortization, charged against Other Sector
income, was $54.9 million in 1993 and 1992,
and $1694 million in 1991.
GMHE
GMHE reported earnings of $921.6 million in
1993. This compares with a loss of $921.6
million in 1992 whtich included the restructur-
ing charge and accounting changes for post-
retirement benefits and revenue recognition
described previously, and earnings of $5594
million in 1991 whiich included the accounting
changes for general purpose spare parts and
income taxes described previously Excluding
these special items, GMHE earnings in 1992
and 1991 would have been $6999 million and
$505.0 million, respectively
Revenues increased 994 to $13,5175 million
in 1993 and 6.6% to $12,2971 million in 1992.
Revenue increases in 1993 were primarily due
to a full year of operations of the missile
business acquired in August 1992 and to the
increased production volumes and electronic
content per vehicle in the automotive electronics
segment. The improvement in operating results
was due to the aforementioned revenue increase,
cost reductions, and improved margins in both
the automotive electronics and defense segments.
GMHE participates in our major business
segments: automotive electronics, telecommuni-
cations and space, defense electronics, and com-
mercial technologies. Revenues fxr the automo-
tive electronics sector were $4,491.6 million,
up 12.7% from $5985.8 million in 1992 and
$5;660.4 million in 1991. Telecommunications
and space revenues were $2,178.0 million, a
13.0% increase over the 1992 total of $1,9279
million and a 179% increase over 1991. Defense
electronics revenues for 1993 were $6,112.1
million compared with $5,5470 million in 1992
and $5,525.1 million in 1991L Commercial
technologies 1993 revenues were $7%5.8
million, a 12.0% decrease from 1992 but a
4.0% increase over 1991.
Diverse mi indicates GMHE growth potential.
GMHE also provides direct support to GM
by supplying components and technologies for
GM vehicles.
In July 1993, GMHE sold its %0% ownership
interest in the Japan Communications Satellite
Company which resulted in a $897 million pre-
tax gain. In December 1993, GMHE sold Hughes
Rediffusion Simulation Limited and related
entities whhich resulted in a pre-tax loss of
$55.0 million.
Amounts or 1992 include a $28.0 million
pre-tax gain on the sale of assets to Hughes-JVC
Technology Corporation and $55.0 million of
pre-tax income from a patent infringement set-
tlement. In August 1992, GMHE acquired the
missile business of General Dynamics Corpora-
tion (GD) or 21.5 million shares of Class H
common stock valued at $450.0 million and cash
of $62.8 million. Subsequently, GD sold those
shares as part of a 29.1 million share public
offering of Class H common stock The principal
purpose of the offering was to broaden the pub-
lic trading mark:t or Class H shares and thereby
increase their liquidity The remaining 76 mil-
lion shares were issued by GM, and the proceeds
were used for general corporate purposes.
Earnings (Loss) per share attributable to
Class H common stock were $2.%0 in 199;
($2.29) in 1992, and $1.59 in 199l, and are
based on the Available Separate Consolidated
Net Income (Loss) of GMHE (described in Note
9 to the Financial Statements).
LQUDrIY AND CAPITAL REOURCES
The return to overall profitability in 1993 resulted
in much stronger cash flow from operations
this year compared with the previous two years.
The Corporations net losses in 1992 and 1991
had adverse effects on cash low and balance
sheet strength during those periods. Despite
negative business conditions during this period,
GM was able to meet its funding needs through
outside borrowings, sale of finance receivables,
equity issuances, sale of assets, sale and
leasebacks, and other means.
In 1992 and 1991, GMs earnings were
inadequate to cover its fixed charges (principally
interest and related charges on debt), primarily
as a result of losses incurred by NAO. The
Corporation is implementing fundamental changes
which it believes will restore the profitability of
those operations and enable the Corporation to
have earnings sufficient to cover its fixed charges,
as was the case in 1903.
Cash Fows
GM had its strongest cash position ever at
yearend. Cash and cash equivalents, including
GMAC, were $13,790.5 million at December 3l,
1993, up from $11,078.6 million a year earlier
due to net cash provided by operating and
investing activities exceeding net cash used in
financing activities.
Cash and cash equivalents at December 51,
1993 with GMAC on an equity basis were
$9762.5 million, up from $72076 million a
year earlier. The increase was due to an excess
of net cash provided by operating and investing
activities over net cash used in financing actiities.
Net cash provided by operating activities,
including GMAC, was $14,655.8 million in 1993.
$9990.9 million in 1992, and $6,498.5 million
in 1991, Net cash provided by operating activities
with GMAC on an equity basis was $l1,406.3
million in 1993, $6,6996 million in 1992, and
$4,6749 million in 1991.
The provisions or plant closings and other
restructurings represented s950.0 million, $1,2%0
million, and $2,820.8 million of noncash
charges to income in 1993, 1992, and 1991,
respectively The Corporations plant closing and
restructuring reserve (excluding environmental)
at December 31, 1993 was $4,120.6 million.
Approimately $5;788.0 million of his total
represents employee job security and fcility
holding costs which will require future cash
outlows, generally spread evenly over the next
si years. Such cash flows will be influenced by
the Corporations ability to manage its work orce
efficiently and effectively within and across geo-
graphic areas during this period. As a result of
the improved alignment of plant capacity and
market demand, the Corporation expects to
achieve improved operating results and cash lows.
Net cash provided by (used in) investing
activities, including GMAC, was $4574 mil-
lion in 1993, $1,542.8 million in 1992, and
($2,798.9) million in 1991L GMAC received
$13,072.2 million in 1993, $11,20l.8 million in
1992, and $2,926.9 million in 1991 from pro-
ceeds from sales of finance receivables. Such
sales, which are an integral element in GMACs
strategy to minimite liquidity concerns, acceler-
ate the conversion of receivables to cash. With
GMAC on an equity basis, net cash provided by
investing activities amounted to $2,465.0 million

delivered to Perry would he diverted to the
Companys other lowa plants. Aong the
Companys alternatives is to tke the
equipment in the Perry plant and use itin
the renovation of the recently purchased
porkplant at ogansport
Although the plants closure would affect
the Companys capacity long-term, there
should be no nearterm impact on total
PorkDivision production levels. The
potential adverse impact on 194 operating
earnings is not espected to be significant.
Whatever the outcome, stockhholders can be
assured the financial performance of the
plantwill eiher be significantly improved or
the plant closed.
International Sales
The dramatic esportgrowth that IBP has
experienced since the early 1980s contin-
ued in 195. Esportsales increased by
8.2% over lstyear and represented 11.9%
ofthe Companys net sales.
Despite weakness in the Japanese
economy the Fr East remained a major
contributor to IBPs success in he interna-
tional marketplace. Export sales to that part
ofthe world were up 12% over 1902.
Thanks to improved packaging technol-
ogy, we have been able to ship more
chilled instead of frozen beef and pork to
Japan. Japan now accounts for more than
half of all U.S. beef, veal and variety meat
exports. It is also the lrgest esport market
for tUS. pork, accounting for two-thirds of
total export sales.
Mexico continues to be a growing
market for U.S. meat products and
promises to get even better, hanks in part
resources have been expended for
employee training and medical manage-
ment progratns, as well as improvements
in equipment design and workplace lyout.
As a resull, employees at IBP have a safer
work environment and IBPs cost of
manufacturing is less.
Mew Board Members
Dr. Wendy Lee Gramm and JoAnn
Doke Smith joined IiBP's Board of Direc-
tors in 1903.
Gramm has chaired the Commodity
Futuures Trading Commission, served as
Alministrator for Information and
Regulatory Afairs at the White House Office
of Management and Budget and directed
the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of
Economics.
Smith is a former Assistant Secretary for
Marketing and Inspection Services for the
US. Department of Agriculture and has
served in numerous capacities in the
livestock industry, inclhding President of
the Ntional Cattlemens Association.

Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior financial
tetmetnts to conform to the current year presentation.
, Inventories:
Inventories are comprised of the following:
C, Credit Arrangements:
IBP has a $250,000,000 senior revolvingterm fcilitv (the
RevolingTerm Fcility) and a $125.000,000 shortterm
revolving fcility (the Short lerm Revolver). Both committed
facilities bear interest, at the Companys option, at varying rates
based upon the banks' base rates or an uncommitted hid
option. From time to time, IBP also uses uncommitted llines of
credit for some or all of its shortterm borrowing needs.
The Revolving'lerm Fcility is a revoling facility which may
be extended for one-year increments annually during the
revoling period with consent of the banks involved. The
revoling period has been extended through November 15,
1904. At the end of the revoling period, any outstanding
borrowings are converted to a two-year credit fhcility with equal
quarterly payments. Commitment fees are 275 to %75of 1%
on the bid option and the unused portion of the committed
fciliy
The ShortTerm Revoler may be extended semiannually for
additional six-month periods with consent of the banks involved.
It has been extended through November 10, 194. Commit-
mentfees are 125 to .25 of 1% on the unused portion of the
fcilis
Borrowings under the Revoling'Term Facility are treated as
currentliabilities with the esception of $100,000,000 which IBP
does not intend to repay within one year This amount is
clssified as long-term in the consolidated balance sheet for
1903; the interest rate at December 25, 1903 on such borrow-
ings was 5.6%.
During 195, the maximum amount of shortterm borrow-
ings under all of IBPs credit arrangements was $137.000,000.
Aerage shortterm borrowings and the weighited average
interest rate during 1903 were $55,687.000 and 5-%. A
December 25, 1003, total borrowings outstanding under
committed fcilities, including the $100.000,000 classified as
long-term, were $100,000,000 and the unused portion totaled
$275000,000.
D. Accounts Payable and
Accrued Expenses:
Accounts payable and accrued espenses are cotmprised of
the following:
E. Income Taxes:
Efective December 27, 1992, IBP adopted SEc6 No. I09 on
a prospectie basis. The cumulative effect of adopting this
statement was to increase net earnings by $12.6 million in fiscal
1903. SEcS No. 109 requires that prior accounting for business
combinations, such as IBPs application of''pushdown account-
ing'to its acquisition hy Occidental in 1981, be adiusted to
reflect remaining assets at fir value rather than net-of-tax value
as under APB No. 11. Any difference between the adjusted
remaining balance and the ttc bases are accounted for as
temporary differences. The cumulative effect of the accounting
change was an increase in property, plant and equipment of
$234million, net of accumulated depreciation of $80.2
f. Financial Instruments:
The following methods and assumptions are used in
estimating the fir value of each clss of the Companys financial
instruments at December 25, 1903:
For cash and cash equivalents, shortterm investments,
accounts receivable and accounts payable, the carrying atnount
isa reasonable estimate of fir value because of the shortterm
nature of these instruments.
For securities included in other assets, fir value is based
upon quoted market prices for these or similar securities. The
carrying amount approximates fir value for these securities.
The fir value of the Companys long-term debt is estimated
by discounting the future cash outlys associated with each debt
instrument using interest rates currently available to the
Company for debt issues with similar terms and remaining
maturities.
The estimated fir values of IBPs financial instruments as of
December 25, 1903, are as follows:
J. Commitments and Contingencies:
IBP is involved in numerous disputes incident to the
ordinary course of its business. In the opinion of management,
any liability for which provision has not been made relative to
the various lawsuits, claims and administrative proceedings
pending against IBP inclding that described below, will not
have a material adverse effect on its financial position.
Acomplaintfiled against IBP in April 1988 by the Depart-
ment of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, in the United States
DistrictCourtin Kunsas seeks injunctive relief and back wages,
plus interest, for certain hourly employees of the Company The
case relates to compensation allegedly due for incidental
activities of hourly employees before and afler regular working
hours. In the liability phase of the case, the district judge has
ruled that IBP is required to pay back wages for a portion of the
incidental activities. An appeal by the Company is in progress.
The Companys management believes it has made adequate
provision for any liability the amount of which, if any will be
determined at a later time.

j Research, Development and Engineering
Research, development and engineering expenses amounted to $ 5,558 million in 1993, $6,522 million in
1992, and $6,644 million in 1991.
Included in these amounts were expenditures of $4,431 million in 1993, $5,083 million in 1992, and
$5,001 million in 1991 for a broad program of research and development activities covering basic scientific
research in a variety of fields and the application of scientific advances to the development of new and improved
products and their uses, Of these amounts, software-related activities were $1,097 million, $1,161 million,
and $994 million in 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively. In addition, espenditures for product-related engi-
neering amounted to $1,127 million, $1,459 million, and $1,645 million for the same three years,
j Restructuring Actions
The company has taken a series of actions since 1985 to streamline and reduce resources utilized in the
business. During 1993 and 1992, he company recorded restructuring charges of $8.9 billion before taxes
($8.0 billion after taxes or $14.02 per common share) and $11.6 billion before taxes ($8.3 billion after taxes or
$14.51 per common share), respectively. These charges are summarized in the table below:
During 1991, the company also recorded a restructuring charge of $3.7 billion before taxes ($2.9 billion after
taxes or $5.05 per common share). Ihe actions contemplated in the 1991 charge were associated with work force
reductions and relocations, facility consolidations, and other related items, which have been essentially completed.
The company records restructuring charges against operations and provides a reserve based upon the best
information available at the time the decision is made to undertake the restructuring action, The reserves
are subsequently utilized when specific restructuring criteria are met, indicating the planned restructuring
action has occurred. Work-force-related reserves are considered utilized at payment for either termination or
acceptance of other contractual arrangements, Manufacturing capacity reserves are considered utilized based
on execution of planned actions at each affected location. The reserve for excess space is utilized when the
remaining lease obligations are settled, or the space has been vacated and subleased.

Why?
Cash Flow From Operations
International Paper continued to generate substantial cash
flow in 1993 despite lower operating earnings. However,
cash provided by operations of $929 million in 1993 was
below the $1.1billion in 1992and $1.2billion in 1991.
During 1993, working capital increased $290 million, most
ofwhich was from lower accounts payable and accrued lia-
bilities. An increase in depreciation and amortization
chargesin 1993 to $898 million from $850 million in 1992
and $725 million in 1991 mitigated the effect of lower net
earnings on cash flow.
Capital Expenditures by Industry Segment
Investment Activities
Capital spending of$954million in 1993 was well below the
$1.4billion and $1.2billion spent in 1992and 1991.'This
reduced spending reflects completion of several major proj-
ectsin late 1992 including Zanders new paper machine for
the production of high-quality base papers and expansion of
Aussedat Reys Saillat pulp mill.
Asin recent years, 1993 capital spending largely focused
on further reduction of production costs, plant upgrades
and incremental capacity expansions, quality and produc-
tivity improvements, and environmental and safety pro-
grams. During 1993, the project at Lock Haven, Pa.,to
produce 100% recycled-paper grades from postconsumer
newspapers and magazines was completed and started
production late in the year. Also, one paper machine at
Kwidzyn, in Poland, was upgraded to improve productivity.
Capital spending for 1994is expected to exceed
$1.1billion. Major projectswillfocus on printing papers
and packaging facilities. In the United States, the design
for a new, low-cost uncoated paper machine at the Riverdale
mill near Selma, Ala., was completed and the majority of
spending for this project will occur during 1994. In Europe,
the $175 million capital investment program for Kwidzyn
will continue.
Spending for acquisitions decreased substantially in
1993. In 1993, $35 million was spentand $22 million of
debt was assumed to acquire certain assets of Los Angeles-
based Ingram Paper Company, a distributor ofindustrial
and fine writing papers, and the assets of Monsanto Com-
panys Fome-Cor division, a manufacturer of polystyrene
foam boards. The Company also acquired the assets of [B
Papers, Inc., a paper distribution company located in Union,
N.[., by issuing l17,000 shares of Company common stock.
In 1992, $153 million was spent and $30 million ac-
crued, principally for the acquisitions of Kwidzyn in Poland
and Western Pacific in Oregon. The Company also spent
$209 million to acquire an equity interest in Scitex, a world
leader in color electronic prepress systems.
In 1991, $457 million was spent and $50 million of debt
assumed to acquire the Rhone Valley Packaging business,
Evergreen Packaging Equipment, Dillard Paper Company
and Scaldia Papier BV. A merger with lLeslie Paper Company
and the formation of a joint venture to control 32%of Carter
Holt Harvey Limited were also completed in 1991.
Cash Flow From Operations
Return on Equity
Financing Activities
In 1993, the Company issued $600 million of long-term
debt asfollows: in March, $200 million of debentures due in
2023; in October, $200 million of debentures due in 2023;
and in November, $200 million of debentures due in 2003.
The proceeds of all debentures were used mainly to reduce
shortterm borrowings and secure favorable long-term inter-
est rates. Interest rate swaps were utilized to obtain the
equivalent of shortterm rates during the first year of the
October and November financings.
In 1992, taking advantage of low interest rates, the
Company increased shortterm borrowings by $657 million
to, in part, retire $255 million of high-rate long-term debt.
Also, in January, 9.2 million shares of common stock were
sold in a public offering yielding $650 million, and $200
million of 7W% notes due in 2007 were issued. These
proceeds were principally used to retire higher rate debt
outstanding at that time.
Net borrowings were $994million in 1991, principally
used to finance acquisitions and large capital projects.
Common stock dividends per share were $.42 per quar-
ter ($1.68 on an annual basis)in 1993, 1992 and 1991.
Paymentswere $208 million in 1993, $206 million in 1992
and $186 million in 1991.
Capital Resource Outlook for 1994
Cash flow from operations is expected to be adequate to
meet internal capital expenditures, working capital and
dividend requirements. A strong balance sheet (debt to
capital ratio of 39%in 1993, up from 38% in 1992 and com-
parable with 39%in 1991)supporting an investmentgrade
debt rating allows ready access to financial markets to take
advantage of external investment and favorable financing
opportunities.
Other Financial Statement Items
Net interestexpense increased to $310 million in 1993 from
$247million in 1992and down from $315 million in 1991.
1992s net interest benefited from tax-related interest in-
come and higher capitalized interest related to two major
European capital projects that are now completed.
Theeffective tax rate for 1993 increased to 42% (37%
before the revaluation of deferred tax balances)of pre-tax
income compared with 31%in 1992 and 37%in 1991.'The
adoption ofSFAS No. 109 and the tax benefit at statutory
rates of the productivity improvement and other charges in
1992 contributed to 1992s lower rate. The increase in the
rate for 1993 resultsfrom the increase in the U. S. statutory
federal income tax rate of 1%, which also increased deferred
taxes by $25 million.
During 1993, the Company recognized tax benefits
amounting to $55 million related to losses at certain of its
non-U.S. operations, increasing noncurrent deferred tax
assetsto $115 million at December 31, 1993. The Company
believes that it is more likely than not that these assets will
be realized.
Environmental Issues
Given the nature of its businesses, International Paper is
closely linked to the environment. Increasingly demanding
environmental laws and regulations have resulted in signifi-
cant capital spending to meet or exceed air, water and solid
waste disposal standards. Environmental capital expendi-
turestotaled $100 million in 1993, $126 million in 1992 and
$107 million in 1991. Capital spending to increase recycling
capacitytotaled $102 million, $35 million and $5 million
in 1993, 1992and 1991, respectively.

which reduced Net income by $296 million on an after-tax
basis. The effect of this change on 1992 Income before
cumulative effect of accounting changes was not material.
In May N93, Statement No. 1l5, Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, was issued which
requires adoption in 1994 This Statement requires certain
investments in debt and equity securities to be reported at
fair value. The effects on the Company's results are not
expected to be material.
The Company believes that it is in compliance in all
material respects with applicable environmental laws and
regulations. The Company has maintained a leadership
role in supporting environmental initiatives and fostering
pollution prevention by actions including the elimination of,
or the application of best available technology to, air
emissions of known or suspect carcinogens at its facilities
worldwide and a project currently underway to reduce all
environmental releases of toxic chemicals by 90% bV 1995
In 1993, the Company incurred capital expenditures of
approximately $122A million for environmental control
facilities. Capital expenditures for this purpose are forecasted
to exceed $4000 million for the years 994 through 1998.
In addition, the Company's operating and maintenance
expenditures for pollution control were approximately $400
million in 1993. Expenditures for this purpose for the years
1994 through 998 are forecasted to exceed $2000 million.
T'he Company is a party to a number of proceedings brought
under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as
Superfund, as well as under other R:deral and state statutes,
While it is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of
these proceedings, management does not believe that they
should ultimately result in a materially adverse effect on the
Company's financial position, results of operations, liquidity
or capital resources. The Company is also remediating
environmental contamination resulting from past industrial
activity at certain of its sites. Expenditures for environmental
purposes were $26.3 million in 1993, and are estimated at
$1700 million for the years 1994 through N998. The Company
has taken an active role in identifying and providing for these
costs; and, therefore, management does not believe that these
expenditures should ultimately result in a materially adverse
effect on the Company's financial position, results of
operations, liquidity or capital resources.
PI \L E H N dI U R s
In 1993, capital expenditures were $10 billion compared to
$1.1 billion in N92. Expenditures in the United States were
$757 million in 1993 and $7840 million in 992. Expenditures
during I93 included $260.1 million for research and
development facilities, $218.5 million for production facilities,
$136.5 million for safety and environmental projects and
They're larger than the U.S. economy, and our penetration of these
economies is significantly lower.
During the year, we continued our strong growth in the Asia Pacific
area and in Latin America. Sales volume of our 12 companies in Asia
outside Japan grew about 40 percent. In Latin America, unit volume
grew more than 20 percent.
In Europe, we completed the transition from country-focused organiza-
tions to business-centered units, This new way of operating is speeding up
decision-making, increasing efficiency and sharpening our customer focus.
We also formed an organization to capitalize on growth opportunities
in Eastern Europe, the Mideast and Central Asia - an area encompassing
more than 40 countries and 750 million people.
4 Customer Satisfaction
We want customers to prefer 3M by a wide margin over our competitors,
This means being the best not only in product quality and value, but in
everything we do - from ease of ordering to accuracy of deliveries.
During the year, we continued to make major investments in customer-
friendly systems for order entry, distribution and invoicing.
Productivity Improvement
To meet our financial goals and stay competitive, we're putting strong
emphasis on productivity improvement. This means:
lGetting the most out of every R&D dollar we spend.
lLowering manufacturing costs through reductions in cycle time,
aste and energy usage.
lMaintaining tight control of capital spending.
Improving marketing efficiency.
lStreamlining organizational structure.
lEliminating activities that don't add value for customers.
During the year, our b percent volume gain was accomplished with
about 1,125 fewer people. We have now reduced employment, largely
through attrition,by about 3,650 on a comparable basis over the last
three years. This has been done while maintaining strong employee
commitment and motivation.
4 Outlook for 1994
Many economists expect a pickup in global economic growth, espe-
cially in the second half of the year. A stronger economy, combined
with a steady stream of new products and ongoing efforts to improve
productivity, will help our results. However, the pricing environment
is likely to remain quite competitive and currency fluctuations could
have a significant, negative effect on our results again this year.
Given all of this, we look for a reasonable increase in 1994 earnings,
along with a continued strong financial position.

with their current products, and we help them design for the future.
For the aerospace industry, the company is working on adhesives for
the next generation of airplanes. 3M is also developing products for
the computer industry, where product offerings change rapidly.
3M's global presence is a major competitive advantage. Customers
want a supplier that can meet their needs worldwide. 3M is ready,
virtually anywhere in the world, to provide not only the products they
need, but also technical support and worker training.
In Europe, 3M has strengthened its position in box-sealing and
masking tapes, large and growing market segments,
In the Asia Pacific area, markets are opening rapidly. 3M has
recently built or expanded adhesives manufacturing operations in
Japan, Korea, Australia, India and China.
In Latin America, the company is already the leading tape
manufacturer in such major markets as Brazil and Mexico and is
extending its reach throughout the region.
In Canada, a new tape plant in Ontario began operation in 1993.
It is expected to be 3M's most efficient plant for producing general-
purpose masking tapes.
A tradition of customer service, an unmatched technology base
and a global presence help ensure that 3M will continue to be a world
leader in adhesives technology.
focus, the operation produced little manufacturing waste.
As the pads were being manufactured, 3M marketers continued
their research, which showed that consumers preferred the Never Rust
soap pad by more than two to one compared with steel wool. At the
same time, marketers refined their plans for packaging, distribution
and sales support. Four-, eight- and 14-count packages would be
available through grocery stores, mass merchandisers, convenience
stores, hardware stores, drug stores and membership-club stores. In
another environmentally sensitive move, the soap pad's eye-catching
boxes were made from 100 percent recycled paper.
To supportthe launch, 3M drew distributors into the effort, soliciting
input on displays and promotions, Television advertising, newspaper
inserts,coupons, free samples and an extensive public relations effort
were also developed to increase consumer awareness and promote sales.
3M's strategic objective of increasing market penetration outside
the United States meant that Never Rust soap pads were destined to
travel, The international marketing plan, developed simultaneously
with the U.S. plan, had a twofold objective: capture share in markets
such as Brazil, where steel wool pads have a large consumer base, and
attract new consumers in places such as Japan, where steel wool is not
commonly used. Never Rust pads were introduced simultaneously in
the United States, Canada, Colombia and New Zealand, then in other
countries in Latin America and the Far East. Tracking studies show
that Never Rust pads have successfully attracted new buyers to the
product category, while strong demand for other Scotch-Brite prod-
ucts has been maintained.
After one of the most successful product launches in 3M history,
the Never Rust team didn't rest on its laurels, Following a typical 3M
pattern, they continued their work on parallel tracks: streamlining
production to improve efficiency and initiating development of the
product's next generation.
In January 1994, 3M introduced Scotch-Brite'' Never Scratch''
Wool Soap Pads. Addressing another limitation of steel wool, Never
Scratch pads provide effective cleaning power for nonstick cookware,
china and other delicate surfaces, Additional products based on this
technology are under development.
Meanwhile, the technology breakthrough in the Never Rust pad
has already found application in other 3M product lines. For example,
Never Rust commercial floor polisher pads, also made from recycled
plastic, offer a better way to clean marble floors.
operating costs were partially
offset by modestly higher net pric-
ing principally at domestic KFC)
and increased franchise royalty
revenues. Domestic profits rose
$87 million or 15%, while inter-
national profits declined $28 mil-
lion or 25% reflecting weakness
in Australia.
Pizza Huts worldwide sales
increased $525 million or 15%
to $4.1 billion. The domestic
operations represent the major
portion of worldwide Pizza Hut.
Additional units contributed $392
million to the worldwide sales
increase. Volume growth provided
about $140 million, driven by
strong domestic gains resulting
from the national rollout of the
new value-priced Bigfoot Pizza in
the second quarter
Comparable sales for domestic
company-owned units (Same
store sales) advanced 5%, though
volume growth was slightly
higher. This performance
reflected growth in all three
distribution channels: delivery,
carryout and dine-in. Improved
sales in both delivery and carryout
were driven by the success of
Bigfoot. The growth in dine-in
reflected the impact of the third
quarter 1992 rollout of the
all-you-can-eat pizza and salad
lunch buffet. Results late in 1993
indicate a softening of same
store sales trends in dine-in due
primarily to lapping last years
rollout of the lunch buffet.
Pizza Huts worldwide profits
advanced $57 million or 11%
to $572 million. This profit per-
formance reflected about $55 mil-
lion from volume growth, $41
million from additional units,
increased franchise royalty reve-
nues and higher international net
pricing. These benefits were par-
tially offset by increased store

Of the income statements of international businesses are identi-
fied, where material, in Managements Analysis of consolidated
and segment operating results. These translation effects exclude
the impact of businesses in highly inflationary countries, where
the functional currency is the U.S. dollar.
Changes in currency exchange rates also result in fxreign
exchange gains and losses, reported as a comiponent of unallo-
cated expenses, netSee page 28). For 1993. 1992 and 1991, net
foreign exchange losses totaled $41.2 million, $1''4 million and
$78 million, respectively. These reported amounts include net
translation losses arising from remeasurement into U'.S. dollars
of the net monetary assets of businesses in highly intlationary
countries, as well as net transaction losses. Cashh flow transaction
gains and losses arise from current assets suchi as receiables
and short-term investments as well as payables (including debt )
ddenominated in currencies other than a business' functional cur-
rency. In implemienting strategies to minimize financing co8ts,
the effects of expected currency exchhange rate moveements on
dlebt and short-term investments are considered along with
related interest rates in measuring effective net financing costs.
Beginning in 1995, Mexico is no longer categorized as highly
inflationary. PepsiCo has not calculated the net foreign eschange
loss that would have been reported in 1995 hhad businesses in
Mexico been accounted for as highly inflationary: however,
translation losses for businesses in Mlexico were not a significant
component of the above 1992 and 1991 amounts.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
tabtlar dollars in mlltons eNcept per share amotuIs)
Note 1- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Signihhcant accounting policies are discussed below, and where
applicable, in the Notes that follow.
Principles of Consolidation. The financial statemments
reflect the consolidated accounts of PepsiCo, Inc. and its con-
trolled aftiliates. Intercomipany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated. Investments in affiliates in which PepsiCo exer-
cises significant influence but not control are accounted for by
the equity method, and the equity in net income is included in
Selling, general and administrative espenses in the Consolidated
Statement of Income. Certain other reclassitications were madle
to prior year amounts to conform with the 1995 presentation.
Marketing Costs, MIarketing costs are reported in Selling,
general and administrative expenses and include costs of adver-
tising, marketing and promotional programys. Promotional
ddiscounts are expensed as incurred, and other m1arketing costs
not deferred are charged to espense ratably in relation to
sales over the year in which incurred. Marketing costs deferred
consist of media and personal service advertising prepaymients,
materials in inventory and production costs of future media
advertising; these asSets are espensed in the year used.
Cash Equivalents. Cashi equivalents represent funds
temporarily invested (with original maturities not exceeding
three months) as part of PepsiCos management of day-to-day
operating cash receipts and disbursemments. All other investment
portfxlios, primarily held outside the U.S., are classified as short-
terdm investmments.
Net Income Per Share. Net income per share is cotmputed
by dividing net income by the weighted average number of
shares and share equialents outstanding during each year
Research and Development Expenses. Researchh and
ddeveloptment espenses, which are expensed as incurred, were
S115 myillion, $102 million and $99 million in 1993, 1992 and
1991, respectivvel.
Note 2- Business Segments
Information regarding industry segments and geographic areas
of operations is provided on pages 2' through 29.
Note 3- Unusual Items
In 1993, P:psiCo recorded a charge of $299 million ($0.04 per
share) to increase its net deferred tax liabilities, as required by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 (SFAS 109).
'Accounting for Incomxe Taxes,' for the 1% statutory rate
increase under U.S. tax legislation enacted in 1995. (See Note 15.)
Unusual charges, principally for restructurings, totaled
$193.5 million in 1992 ($128.5 million after-tas or $0.16 per
share) and $1'0.0 million in 1991 ($1198 million after-tas
or $0.15 per share ). In 1992, PepsiCo adopted the Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 (SEAS 106). 'Employers'
Accounting for Postretiremxent Benefits Other Than Pensions''
and SFAS 109 effective December 29, 1991. (See Notes l0 and 15.)
As compared to the previous accounting methods, the adoption
of SEAS 106 and SFAS 109 reduced 1992 operating profit by
$'2.8 million ($195 million after-tax or $0.02 per share ) Infor-
mmation regarding the effect of these actions on com)paralxility
of operating protits is provided on page 27.
The 1991 amounts above were calculated under the previous
accounting method. The 1991 deferred provision arose prin-
cipally from accelerated expense recognition for tax purposes
as compared to financial reporting and included amounts related
to depreciation of property, plant and equipment of $56.2 mil-
lion, amortization of intangibles of $49.0 million and increased
prefunding of employee benefits of $25.5 million, partially offset
by $417 million related to restructuring charges.
Tax benefits associated with exercises of stock options totaled
$25.4 million in 1993, $575 million in 1992 and $8.5 million in
1991. These amounts were credited to shareholders' equity A
change in the functional currency of operations in Mexico from
the UU.S. dollar to local currency in 1993 resulted in a $193 mil-
lion decrease in the net deferred foreign tax liability that was
credited to shareholders' equity.
U.S. and foreign income before income taxes and cumulative
effect of accounting changes:
Detail of the 1995 and 1992 deferred tax liabilities (assets):
The valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets rose by
$677 million in 1993 and $58.5 million in 1992, which offset
higher deferred tax assets arising primarily from increased net
operating loss carryforwards. The net operating loss carryfor-
wards largely relate to a number of foreign and state jurisdictions
and expire over a range of dates.
The deferred tax liability for Safe Harbor Leases (the Leases)
is related to transactions, which PepsiCo entered into in 1981
and 1982, that decreased income taxes paid by PepsiCo over the
initial years of the Leases and are now increasing taxes payable.
Additional taxes paid in 1993 related to the Leases totaled
$6.-i million, and taxes payable are estimated to be $40.5 million
over the next five years. The provision for income taxes is not
impacted by the Leases.
Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognized for bases
dddifferences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries
and joint ventures. These differences, which consist primarily
of unremitted earnings intended to be indefinitely reinvested,
ARgregated approximately $5.2 billion at year-end 1995 and
$2.4billion at year-end 1992, exclusive of amounts that if
remitted in the future woould result in little or no tax under
current tax laws and the Puerto Rico tax incentive grant. Deter-
mination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities
is not practicable.
1 ' ploration and Production s business strategy is based on several key goals.
1 Firs, EdP is working to increase the walue of its assets by adding oil and
natiural gas reseres orrer the long term at competitie costs, Improying
profitabilitv through stronger cash flow and continuing to improve on EdP s strong
safet1r and envtironmental performance are also ''fundamental to increasing
shareholder value -- a commitment we have made at Phillips, '' says ,Johhhn Witmire,
EdP executive vice president.
''Our fiuture depends on how well we manage our business, '' Whitmire says, ''HVhat
we re after is a ralue-oriented approach in everything we do. Our goal is not simplyr to
find oil and natural gas .., it's to find and develop these resources in a way that
generates significant value over the long term.''
Earnings Increase
Net income increased 5 percent, to $386
million, in 1993. The increase was mainly
due to higher U.S. natural gas sales prices
and gains from asset sales, along with
lower worldwide production costs and
depreciation charges. Partly offsetting
these positive trends were lower crude oil
sales prices and volumes, and foreign cur-
rency losses, versus gains a year ago.
Capital Expenditures Higher
Capital expenditures were up significantly
in 1993 -- to $819 million versus $583
million in 1992 - as work began on sev-
eral important developments scheduled to
begin production in the mid-1990s. These
include development of the Judy/Joanne
fields in the United Kingdom (U.K.)
North Sea and the Xijiang project off-
shore China, among others. E&P capital
expenditures (representing nearly 70 per-
cent of Phillips' total) included two new
tankers for the company's liquefied natur-
al gas (LNG) operations in Kenai, Alaska.
These tankers were subsequently sold
during the year and leased back to
Phillips.
Emphasis on Value, Reserves Growth
E&P's four operating divisions -- North
America, Norway, U.K. and International
-- are pursuing value in project selection
and at each stage of the exploration and
production cycle. Says Whitmire: ''We
are making new discoveries and accelerat-
ing development efforts. As a result, our
projects are becoming profitable sooner.''
Phillips is also working to achieve
stronger performance from existing
assets, focusing on those that offer strong
profit margins, growth potential or strate-
gic positioning. ''If an asset is not adding
value, we'll sell it or trade it for one that
will--- increasing the value of Phillips'
holdings,'' Whitmire says.
Several Assets Sold
Several non-strategic E&P assets were
sold in 1993, including Phillips' interest
in the Harriet field, offshore western
Australia; the Kakap field in Indonesia;
the Waalwijk gas field in the Netherlands;
production operations in western Egypt,
and properties in North America. For the
year, proceeds fromm asset sales (excluding
the LNG tankers) totaled $176 million.
Reserves Replacement Strong
Technology continues to play an impor-
tant role in replacing reserves - helping
Phillips increase oil and natural gas
recovery from mature fields and identify
reserves in complex geological structures.
Phillips replaced 104 percent of its world-
wide production on a barrel-of-oil-equiva-
lent (BOE) basis in 1993, and 147 percent
of U.S. production. Over the last five
Earnings Move Higher
Net income rose 83 percent in 1993, to
$75 million. The increase was mainly
due to the sale of Phillips' fibers opera-
tions and improved ethylene margins.
These items were partly offset by contin-
uing low margins in the polyethylene
line and a writedown associated with the
company's decision to exit the catalyst
business.
Capital Spending Levels Off
After several years of high capital expen-
ditures on new polyethylene facilities at
HCC and a major ethylene unit at the
Sweeny, Texas, facility, spending
declined 35 percent in 1993, to about
$162 million. Expenditures went for a
new catalyst plant (which is being sold),
and several projects at HCC, including a
major upgrade of polypropylene opera-
tions, a new plant water system and con-
struction of an office building.
HDDPE Production, Quality Improve
HCC's production of high-density poly-
ethylene (HDPE) was up more than 50
percent in 1993, as sales approached lev-
els that existed before a 1989 accident
destroyed the company's domestic
capacity.
Polyethylene production at HCC con-
tinued to move toward full capacity (1.8
billion pounds annually) during the first
half of the year. But with low prices and
margins, the decision was made to stabi-
lize production and sales volumes at
about 1.4 billion pounds a year to control
product inventories. To boost revenues,
Phillips increased its prices for polyeth-
ylene and polypropylene, and the quality
of HDPE was improved.
In the future, Phillips plans to con-
tinue participating in the fast-growing
Asian market, supplying polyethylene
from HCC and its Singapore facility,
where an expansion will double the
3.2 billion pounds a year. The plant also
increased capacity for propylene, a feed-
stock for polypropylene plastics. As
building-block chemicals, olefins are
vital to Phillips' chain of integration --
the ability to upgrade the value of raw
materials.
Aromatics: Aromatics and cyclics results
benefited in 1993 from higher sales vol-
umes and reduced feedstock costs. This
helped offset lower sales prices for
cyclohexane (a feedstock for nylon) and
paraxylene (a feedstock for polyester).
Aromatics are produced at Borger,
Sweeny and Puerto Rico, and are sold to
outside customers. Phillips is the world's
leading cyclohexane producer, with 70
percent of U.S. capacity and 14 percent
worldwide.
Specialties: The specialty chemicals
business remained a steady income pro-
ducer in 1993, thanks to higher sales vol-
umes for sulfur chemicals produced at
the Borger, Texas, and Tessenderlo,
Belgium, plants.
At Tessenderlo, production of poly-
sulfides (used in lubricant additives)
began in 1993, opening the door to new
markets. In the U.S., sales were higher
for Borger-produced isobutylbenzene, a
feedstock for the pain reliever ibuprofen.
Sales were also up for oil field chemicals
manufactured at Phillips' Conroe, Texas,
plant. This was mainly due to increased
exploration and production activity in the
Gulf of Mexico.
PolyethylenePolypropylene: Although
sales volumes for polyethylene were up
for the year, overcapacity in the market
kept prices and margins low. Results for
polypropylene were down, compared
with 1992, due to a major renovation of
manufacturing facilities at HCC, which
limited production.
Pipe Operations: Phillips Driscopipe.
Inc. achieved record sales volumes and
brought in higher earnings for the year.
Driscopipe, based in Richardson, Texas,
is the nation's largest supplier of poly-
ethylene pipe. Sales of gas distribution
pipe brought in the highest margins, and
sales were up for water and sewer lines.
Driscopipe also introduced a new prod-
uct --- Opticore--- during the year. Used
for water and sewer applications,
Opticore is unique in that it is white on
the inside (rather than black). allowing
customers to check the condition of the
buried pipe with fiber-optic cameras.
K-Resin: Thanks to higher sales in 1993,
K-Resin was the top earnings producer
in the plastics line and set a new produc-
tion record. This tough, clear plastic is
used to make products such as toys, dis-
posable cups and shower doors. Recent
product improvements are opening new
markets for K-Resin, such as food and
medical packaging.
Engineering Plastics: Stronger demand
and new applications for Ryton engineer-
ing plastics pushed sales higher in 1993.
Overcapacity in the market, however,
lowered prices and margins. Ryton's
1993 results were lower than the year
before, mainly because 1992 earnings
benefited from an asset sale. Ryton
(polyphenylene sulfide) is the brand
name for Phillips' high-performance,
heat- and chemical-resistant resins and
compounds. Ryton is used to manufac-
ture electrical or electronic components
and under-the-hood automotive parts.
New Products Expand Plastics Markket
Phillips is working to develop new prod-
ucts and processes--- or upgrade exist-
ing ones - to bring in higher margins.
The company completed development of
new high-flow injection molding resins
in 1993, aimed at the thin-walled con-
tainer market. Because these resins have
very low odor and taste, they work well
for food packaging, such as margarine
tubs, yogurt containers and plastic cups.
The company is also evaluating an
improved HDPE blow molding resin
used to make containers for household
and industrial chemicals, such as bleach
and detergent.
The decrease in operating income for 1993 resulted from lower
crude oil sales prices and volumes, lower natural gas production,
and higher exploration expenses, primarily from dry hole charges
for wells drilled on the Sunfish, Kuvlum and Wild Weasel
prospects in Alaska. Partially offsetting these negative factors
were 19 percent higher natural gas sales prices.
U.S. crude oil and natural gas production was lower in 1993,
compared with 1992, primarily due to normal declines in produc-
tion from mature fields. The decline in crude production was
partly offset by increased production from the Point Arguello
field, offshore California.
The increase in operating income from 1991 to 1992 was pri-
marily due to higher natural gas sales prices, lower exploration
expenses and lifting costs, and tax credits for producing fuel from
a nonconventional source related to the company's San Juan
Basin natural gas production. These positive factors were partly
offset by lower sales prices for crude oil and liquefied natural gas.
Special items in 1993 included a $5 million after-tax refund of
windfall profit taxes. The $11 million in special items in 1992
included after-tax asset-sale gains of $19 million, which were
more than offset by a natural gas imbalance accrual adjustment
Operating income increased for 1993, compared with 1992,
because of lower lifting costs and exploration expenses, partially
offset by lower crude oil and natural gas sales prices and vol-
umes. Lifting costs were lower in 1993 partly due to a stronger
dollar against the kroner in the company's Norwegian opera-
tions. Exploration expenses were lower primarily due to lower
dry hole expenses in Canada, Norway and other foreign coun-
tries.
Foreign crude oil production was down in 1993, compared
with 1992, primarily because of the sale of producing properties
in Indonesia and Australia, as well as lower production in the
United Kingdom sector of the North Sea. Partially offsetting the
production decline was the 1993 start-up of Embla field produc-
tion in the Ekofisk area.
Natural gas production was down in 1993, due mainly to
lower demand. The lower output was partially offset by higher
production in the United Kingdom, aided by the Ann gas field,
which came on stream in October 1993.
The decrease in operating income from 1991 to 1992 resulted
from lower sales prices for crude oil and natural gas, along with
a decline in crude oil sales volumes. Crude oil production was
down in 1992, compared with 1991, due to lower production in
Indonesia and the United Kingdom, coupled with the sale of pro-
ducing properties in Argentina late in the fourth quarter of 1991.
Natural gas production was up in 1992, compared with 1991, pri-
marily from higher production in Norway.
Special items in 1993 included after-tax asset-sale gains of
$26 million, while special items in 1992 included after-tax for-
eign currency gains of $30 million. Special items in 1991
included after-tax asset-sale gains of $78 million, partially offset
by after-tax foreign currency losses of $29 million.

The estimated unrealized losses shown above represent the incremental charge to earnings to
immediately settle all interest rate swaps, However, it is the Companys current intention to
leave these instruments outstanding until maturity over various periods extending to the year
2004, in which case no incremental charge to earnings will be realized.
Currency Instruments
The Company is subject to market rate risk from exposure to changes in currency exchange rates
primarily in three areas: commercial transactions, intercompany tinancings and net investments
in foreign subsidiaries.
The primary purpose of the Companys foreign currency hedging activities is to protect
against the risk that local currency cash flows associated with purchase transactions will be
adversely affected by changes in exchange rates, Although this foreign currency exposure is
managed locally, corporate policy prescribes the range of hedging activity into which the
subsidiary operations may enter. To execute this policy, the Company utilizes forward exchange
contracts and options with durations ot generally less than twelve months. The impact of
changes in the value of these instruments typically offsets changes in the value of the underlying
transactions. For accounting purposes, gains and losses on option contracts that hedge
identifiable anticipated transactions and on forward contracts that hedge firm commitments are
included in the measurement of the related transaction, Gains and losses on instruments used
for other purposes are recognized currently.
The Company manages its foreign exchange exposure associated with intercompany
financing transactions primarily using foreign currency swaps. Gains and losses on such
instruments mitigate the impact on earnings of currency exchange rate changes on the
underlying transactions.
The impact of net asset exposures related to investments in foreign subsidiaries are managed
primarily through local currency financing, and by foreign currency denominated debt issued
by the parent company. As discussed in the interest rate instruments section, the Company has
also entered into currency interest rate swaps, which effectively convert the principal and
interest cash flows of certain existing debt to foreign currency obligations. The currency
translation associated with these obligations is designated as a hedge of the net investment in
the foreign subsidiaries and reflected in the currency translation adjustment in shareholders'
equity.
Currency instruments outstanding at June 50, 1994 were as follows:

The principal plans used the follow:ing actuarial assumptions for accounting purposes:
ing of Sara Lees Personal Products
business announced in June 1994, sheer
hosiery capacity in all major markets is
being adjusted to match market demand.
Concurrently, capacity for more casual
products, such as tights, opaques and
trouser socks, is being increased. These
changes will enable Sara Lee to better
capitalize on demand in all legwear
categories, while maintaining leading
market shares.
Sara Lee will continue to build brand
equity through increased advertising
support and strategic package and dis-
play redesigns. In addition, an extensive
public awareness campaign designed to
convey messages about the quality,
comfort and functionality of sheer
hosiery products is under way. In adver-
tising, quality improvements and fea-
tures that enhance appearance are being
emphasized at all price points.
L eggs has begun reengineering prod-
uct displays, simplifying the purchase
decision with quicker access to informa-
tion regarding fit, appearance, comfort
and specific product features.
In Europe, the Dim: brand has
undergone an entire packaging and
advertising redesign aimed at reestab-
lishing the dominance of this strong
megabrand and more clearly communi-
cating product attributes.
Major New Products
Product development in both the United
States and Europe is focusing on value-
added products to drive sales in the
sheer hosiery business and capitalize
on emerging trends in casual legwear.
In the United States, 15 products
were either launched during the latter
half of fiscal 1994 or will be introduced
in early fiscal 1995.
Hanes introductions included two
products offering waist-to-toe figure
control: Smootb lllusions hosiery, which
combines body contouring with a sheer
appearance, and the more moderately
priced Profiles brand. Other successful
introductions were Sili Reflections Soft
Toucb microfiber hosiery and the Silik
Reflectioms Plus product for fullfigured
women. During fiscal 1995, Hanes will
feature a new line of casual legwear for
younger women through its E. G. Snitb
designer label.
In fiscal 1994. L ggs Neu Seer
Energy hosiery, with enhanced comfort
and fit, was introduced nationally.
Leggs also introduced sheer and casual
legwear under the Hanes Hey W2ay
brand, Color lMle Natural hosiery for
African-American women, and a new
toning and shaping product, Sbeer
Energ) Sbapers,
Controltop, microfiber and ultra-
sheer features are the focus of new or
improved hosiery in Europe as well.
The Filodoro Group, a leading Italian
hosiery manufacturer acquired in fiscal
1993, will espand product offerings
in the childrens category and begin
distribution of its P6ilipye Alatgnon
brand in France.
Global Opportunities
Longterm profitability for Sara Lees
hosiery business will be fueled by pro-
gressive new product development, as
well as initiatives and acquisitions that
open new markets.
Fiscal 1994 acquisitions included The
South African Hosiery Company (Pty.)
Ltd., which markets products under
several brand names in South Africa,
and Peri Shoji Co., Ltd., which further
established Sara Lee hosiery in [apan.
Sara Lee acquired a majority ownership
position in Shanghai Vocal Enterprise
Ltd., a Chinese hosiery company. early
in fiscal 1995.
Geographic expansion continued in
the Americas, with the Hanes and L eggs
brands going into full distribution in
Canada during fiscal 1994. In addition,
the L ggs brand and designer collection
of Uonna Kaan hosiery were introduced
in Mexico and Japan.
This Financial Review discusses the
corporations results of operations and
financial position.The discussion should
be read in conjunction with the Review
of Operations and the Consolidated
Financial Statements and related notes.
Results of üperations
Net sales increased 6.6% to $15.5 billion
in 1994, from $14.6 billion in 1995 and
$13.2 billion in 1992. The increase in
1994 was principally attributable to
business acquisitions and unit volume
growth, offset in part by the weakening
of foreign currencies relative to the U.S.
dollar. The increase in 1995 resulted
principally from business acquisitions,
net of dispositions, unit volume growth
and the strengthening of foreign cur-
rencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Exclud-
ing the effects of foreign currencies and
acquisitions and dispositions, sales dollars
increased 3% in 1994 and 5% in 1993.
The gross profit margin was 37.6%
in 1994, compared with 38.0% in 1993
and 37.3% in 1992.'The decrease in
1994 was attributable to margin declines
in European hosiery and knit products
businesses, offset in part by improved
margins in the Household and Personal
Care and Packaged Meats and Bakery
operations.The improvement in 1993
was attributable to increased operating
efficiencies resulting from business
restructuring, tighter cost controls
and benefits resulting from capital
expenditures.
Operating income, which is pretax
earnings before interest and corporate
expenses, decreased 51.6% to $632
million, from $1,307 million in 1993,
while the 1995 operating income
reflected an 8.2% increase over the
S1,207 million in 1992.
On June 6, 1994, the corporation
announced a restructuring of its world-
wide operations which will result in the
closure of 94 manufacturing and distri-
bution facilities and the severance of
9,900 employees. This restructuring
reduced 1994 operating income, net
income and primary earnings per share
by $732 million, $495 million and
$1.05, respectively. The 1994 operating
income includes charges for restructur-
ing as follows: Personal Products-
$650 million; Household and Personal
Care--$55 million; Coffee and
Grocery-$25 million; and Packaged
Meats and Bakery-$22 million.
Of the total pretax charge for
restructuring, $289 million relates to
anticipated losses associated with the
disposal of land, buildings and improve-
ments, and machinery and equipment;
$112 million relates to anticipated expen-
ditures to close and dispose of the idle
facilities; $239 million relates to antici
pated payments to severed employees:
$55 million relates to the recognition
of pension benefits associated with the
severed employee group; and $59 mil-
lion primarily relates to losses associated
with the disposal of certain businesses.
As of July 2,1994, no material actions
contemplated in the restructuring plan
have taken place.
Restructuring actions are expected
to be substantially completed by 1996,
and the corporation expects to fund the
costs of the plan from internal sources
and available borrowing capacity.
The corporation expects the restruc-
turing plan to begin lowering operating
costs in 1995 and to generate increasing
savings in subsequent years, growing
to an annual savings of approximately
$250 million in 1998. Savings from
the planned actions will be used for
both business-building initiatives and
profit improvement.
Excluding the effects of the restruc-
turing charge, acquisitions and fluctua-
tions in foreign exchange rates, operating
income in 1994 was virtually unchanged
from 1993 and increased by approxi
mately 27 in 1993. In 1994, operating
income in the Packaged Foods segment
increased 2.5% and Packaged Consumer
Products segment decreased 94.5%..
Excluding the restructuring charge.
operating income in the Packaged Foods
segment increased 10.5%. while the
Packaged Consumer Products segment
was virtually unchanged from 1993
results.The increase in the Packaged
Foods segment is primarily attributable
to higher unit volumes, operating effi-
ciencies, cost controls and business
acquisitions, offset in part by the weak-
ening of foreign currencies relative to
the U.S. dollar. The flat results in the
Packaged Consumer Products segment
were primarily attributable to weak
performances in the European hosiery
and knit products operations and the
weakening of foreign currencies relative
to the U.S. dollar, offset by the impact
of business acquisitions and strong
U.S. knit products and worldwide
intimates results.
Net interest expense was $145 million
in 1994, compared with $82 million in
1993 and $94 million in 1992.'The
increase in 1994 was a result of increased
financing needs for acquisitions and
capital expenditures.The reduction in
1993 was primarily a result of lower
short-term interest rates and the tempo-
rary refinancing of maturing longterm
debt with short-term notes payable.
Unallocated corporate expenses are
costs not directly attributable to specific
segment operations. Unallocated cor-
porate expenses were $98 million in
1994and $145 million in 1993.The
reduction in 1994 was primarily attribut-
able to lower administrative expenses
and costs related to hedging foreign
currency movements. Unallocated cor-
porate expenses, excluding the impact
of unusual items, were $161 million in
1992. The unusual items recognized in
1992 consisted of a $412 million gain
from the sale of the corporations over-
the-counter pharmaceutical business,
offset in part by a $190 million provision
primarily related to restructuring
the Packaged Foods segment. The
restructuring consisted primarily of
MAMAGEMENT'S REPORT ON FNAMCAL INFORMATION
Management of Sara Lee Corporation is
responsible for the preparation and
integrity of the financial information
included in this annual report.The
financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and, where
required, reflect our best estimates
and judgments.
It is the corporations policy to main-
tain a control-conscious environment
through an effective system of internal
accounting controls supported by formal
policies and procedures communicated
throughout the corporation,These con-
trols are adequate to provide reasonable
assurance that assets are safeguarded
against loss or unauthorized use and to
produce the records necessary for the
preparation of financial information.
There are limits inherent in all systems
of internal control based on the recogni-
tion that the costs of such systems
should be related to the benefits to be
derived. We believe the corporations
systems provide this appropriate balance.
The control environment is comple-
mented by the corporations internal
auditors, who perform extensive audits
and evaluate the adequacy of and the
adherence to these controls, policies
and procedures. In addition, the corpo-
rations independent public accountants
have developed an understanding of our
accounting and financial controls, and
have conducted such tests as they
consider necessary to support their
report below.
The board of directors pursues its
oversight role for the financial state-
ments through the Audit Committee, (
which is composed solely of outside
directors. The Audit Committee
meets regularly with management, the
corporate internal auditors and Arthur
Andersen LLP. jointly and separately,
to receive reports on managements
process of implementation and adminis-
tration of internal accounting controls,
as well as auditing and financial
reporting matters, Both Arthur
Andersen LLP and the internal
auditors have unrestricted access to
the Audit Committee.
The corporation maintains high
standards in selecting, training and
developing personnel to help ensure
that managements objectives of
maintaining strong, effective internal
controls and unbiased, uniform reporting
standards are attained. We believe it is
essential for the corporation to conduct
its business affairs in accordance with
the highest ethical standards as
expressed in Sara Lee Corporations
Code of Conduct.
REPORT OF INOEPENOENT PIBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors
and Stockholders,
Sara Lee Corporation:
We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of
SARA LEE CORPORATION (a
Maryland corporation) AND SUBSID-
IARIES as of July 2, 1994. July 3, 1995
and June 27, 1992, and the related
consolidated statements of income,
common stockholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the
period ended July 2, 1994.These
consolidated financial statements are
the responsibility of the Corporations
management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accord-
ance with generally accepted auditing
standards.Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the
consolidated financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the
overall consolidated financial statement
presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated finan-
cial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Sara Lee Corporation
and Subsidiaries as of July 2, 1994,
July 3, 1995 and June 27, 1992, and
the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended July 2, 1994 in
conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.
As explained in the Notes to
Financial Statements, the Corporation
adopted the requirements of Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards
Nco. 109,''Accounting for Income
Tases,'effective July 4, 1993.
During the year, we began
producing gas from the Antrim, a
shale formation across much of
northern Michigan. By employing
best practices of other producers
in the area, we were able to devel-
op this field more quickly and less
expensively than in the past with-
out compromising our high safety
and environmental standards. We
are exploring for additional gas in
the region.
''Enhanced'' techniques are
used to produce oil that is difficult
to extract from reservoirs by pri-
mary means, We inject steam, pri-
marily in California, to dislodge
heavy crudes, Carbon dioxide is
injected, primarily in West Texas,
to improve the recovery of lighter
crudes, Enhanced operations
accounted for 55 percent of net
domestic crude oil and condensate
production in 1993.
Natural Gas - We continue to
seek opportunities to produce
and market natural gas, and are
continuing our strategy of selling
our gas to longer-term customers
who place a high value on a reli-
able and secure supply. In sup-
port of this strategy, we obtained
storage capacity and became a
more aggressive purchaser of
third-party gas for resale.
lnternational Operations
In 1995, we explored andlor
produced in 12 countries outside
the United States, International
operations accounted for about
10 percent of our net production
on a crude oil equivalent basis,
International production of
crude oil and condensate was
61,000 barrels per day, essentially
unchanged from 1992. Principal
production was in Syria and
Cameroon, with Syria contribut-
ing over 50 percent of our net
international crude oil and con-
densate production, Late in
1993, we combined our Syrian
exploration and production
operations with selected explo-
ration and production holdings
of a subsidiary of Shell Petroleum
N,V. We own a 25 percent equi
ty interest in the new company.
A major portion of future
crude oil production outside the
United States will come from
Yemen and China, In the Yemen-
Masila Block, where we have a 20
percent ownership interest, pro-
duction began in July 1993 at a
gross rate of 50,000 barrels per
day following completion of field
production facilities and a
pipeline and offhore loading ter-
minal. By the end of 1995, pro-
duction had reached more than
125,000 barrels of oil per day as
additional wells were brought on
stream. Ofhore China, Shell Oil
and other working interest owners
began fabrication of platforms to
develop two oil fields in the Pearl
River Mouth Basin. Production
from one field should begin by
late 1994, with production from
the other commencing in 1995.
Net natural gas production
increased 59 percent to 59 mil-
lion cubic feet per day, due pri
marily to initial production from
a platform in the Merluza Field,
offhore Brazil. Principal produc-
tion was in New Zealand and
Syria, as well as Brazil.
During 1995, with others, we
conducted seismic operations in
Syria, Ycmen, Angola, China and
Cameroon, and drilled exploration
wells in Syria, Yemen, Angola and
Indonesia. At year-end, explo-
ration drilling had commenced in
Bolivia. In the coming year, we
expect to continue our exploration
efforts in these countries and to
add selected new ventures,
and Malaysian operations, were transferred to affiliates of the
Royal Dutch/Shell Group of Companies.
Liquidity - Internally generated cash, access to outside
financing based on strong credit ratings, and prudent man-
agement of working capital are the essential components of
Shell Oils liquidity position, Cash and cash equivalents
amounted to $1,296 million at year-end 1995, an increase of
$562 million over 1992 and $744 million over 1991.
Shell Oils strategy continues to rely mainly on internally
generated cash to finance routine operating requirements
and capital spending. Short-term borrowings will generally
be used to fund interim working capital needs and unusual
requirements, As of December 31, 1995, unused backup
credit facilities of $500 million were available for general
corporate purposes, including support of commercial notes,
The Company plans to manage the level of backup facilities
consistent with its cash and cash equivalents balances. Dur-
ing 1993, Shell Oil edeemed all of the esisting $250 million
of 8 3/8 percent Notes Due 1996 and retired $250 million
of 7 5/8 percent Notes Due 1993. As of the end of 1993,
$500 million of a $1.0 billion shelf registration remained,
allowing future flexibility in the markets,
The Company utilizes financial derivatives from time to
time to manage its financial risk exposure to interest rates and
certain commodity prices, During 1995 Shell Oil entered
into interest rate swaps related to existing long term debt. At
December 51, 1993, the notional amount of such swaps was
$250 million with maturities extending into 1996. In the
future, the Company may increase the level of financial deriv-
atives activities as business conditions warrant.
Working capital at the end of 1993 increased $185 mil-
.ion over a year earlier due primarily to higher cash and cash
zquivalents, offset in part by lower receivables and invento-
ries. Shell Oils liquidity position is considerably stronger
han indicated by these working capital levels because of rel-
atively lower historical costs assigned to inventories under
LIFO accounting procedures. The year-end inventory values
included in working capital were below their current costs by
$648 million at the end of 1993, $1,049 million in 1992
and $1,104 million in 1991. Current assets exceeded cur-
rent liabilities by $273 million at the end of 1993, $88 mil-
lion at the end of 1992, while current liabilities exceeded
current assets by $1,262 million at the end of 1991.
Environmental Matters
Shell Oil continues to make substantial capital and oper-
ating expenditures relating to the environment, including
expenditures associated with compliance with federal, state
and local environmental regulations. Included within such
expenditures are costs of compliance with the various laws,
regulations and permit requirements concerning reduction
of releases into air and water and disposal and handling of
wastes at ongoing operating locations, Also included within
such overall environmental expenditures are the costs of
remedial orders, corrective action requirements and other
cleanup obligations under federal, state and local law and by
contract both at operating locations and at previously owned
or operated properties, as well as remediation costs at off-
premises sites,
Discussions are ongoing with governmental agencies as to
the scope and magnitude of Shell Oils present closure and
post-closure Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA) and similar state or local remediation obligations at
operating locations, Such discussions are part of the normal
RCRA regulatory process, Shell Oil anticipates that those
discussions will result in corrective action being required cur-
rently at its manufacturing locations, The complexity of the
fact issues and the evolving legal requirements, coupled with
the many choices made available by diverse technologies that
may be used in such corrective action, make it difficult to
estimate with great reliability the total costs of such action.
However, Shell Oil currently estimates the costs of imple-
menting corrective action at its Martinez, California Manu-
facturing Complex to be about $20 million, of which
approximately $16 million has been expended and the
remainder has been provided for in the accounts, This esti-
mate is down approximately $10 million from previous esti-
mates because investigations to date have uncovered less con-
tamination than expected and more cost-effective remedia-
tion methods have been utilized. Expenditures at Martinez
have taken place over five years with the maximum expendi-
ture in any year being about $7 million Corrective action at
Shell Oils Carson Plant (part of the former Wilmington
Refinery) is expected to cost about $13 million, which
amount is also provided for in the accounts, We are not
i8. Operating Segments Information (continued)
Among the issues confirmed by the Stipulation and Agreemment is the ability of Tennessee to colleet from customers,
on an accrual basis, the costs of providing benefits other than pensions to retirecs, These costs were previously collected
from customers on a ''pay-as-you-go'' basis, The Stipulation and Agreement allowed lennessee to collect over a 20-year
period the transition obligation related to postretirement benefit costs, Tennessee had previously expensed these amounts
when FAS No. 106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than I'ensions,'' was adopted in 1992.
As a result of this Stipulation and Agreement, Tennessee has cstablished a regulatory asset of $34 million and has
included the income effect of this favorable regulatory development in the income statement caption, 'Other income, net.''
On June 25. 1992, the FERC approved a settlement allowing Tennessee to recover from its customers up to
$650 million of excess gas supply costs incurred through July 1, 1992, in resolving take-or-pay costs and payments to
producers to suspend or terminate contracts or to reduce contract prices to market levels. The settlement also allowed
Tennessee to plaee into effeet, as of July 1, 1992, a Gas Inventory Charge providing a mechanism for the recovery of
thesc escess gas supply costs until September 1, 1993, the effectiye date of Tennessee's implementation of Order No. 636.
Tennessee charged to operating cspenses that portion of escess gas supply costs incurred prior to the immplementation of
Order No. 636 that it cannot recover from customers.
On April 8, 1992, the FERC issued Order No. 636 which, together with subsequently issued clarifving Order
Nos. 636-A and 636-B (the '*FERC Restructuring Orders''), direeted a further swceping restructuring of the interstate
gas pipeline industry, The FERC Restructuring Orders required pipelines to: 1) '*unbundlc'' their transportation and
storagc services from their sales seryices, 2) increase pipeline customers' flexibility to change receipt and delivery points
under transportation contracts and to allow release of capacity under those contracts for use by others and 8) separate
interstate pipelinc gas sales organizations from interstate pipeline transportation and storage business units, Under the
FERC Restructuring Orders, rates for pipelinc transportation and storagc generally remain subjcct to traditional cost-
of-service regulation but under a rate design which is relativelv insensitive to throughput and hence less sensitive to
scasonal variation, Sales of natural gas by interstate pipelines oceur pursuant to a blanket sales certificate under which
price and other terms of sale are set by market forces, After a serics of FERC orders and compliance filings, lennessee
implemented its Order No. 636 tariff commencing on September 1, 1993, restructuring its transportation, storagc
and sales services,
The FERC Restructuring Orders recognized that transition costs, including gas supply realignment costs, may result
from this restructuring and provided mechanisms for the full recovery of such qualified costs, I'ipelines wcre encouragedd
to propose various mechanisms in the restructuring proceedings to reduce transition costs, including assignment of gas
supply contracts and phasing in of the conversions of the pipeline sales service. The FERC Restructuring Orders specified
that pipelines would be allowed to make special filings to recover many types of transition costs.
Tennessee has made multiple filings to begin recovery of certain transition costs already paid or obligated to be
paid in connection with the FERC Restructuring Orders. Tennessee's filings request authority to: 1) recover, through a
monthly surcharge, one-time gas supply realignment costs and certain related costs incurred to date over a twelve-month
period, 2) direct-bill customers for unrecovered gas costs over a twelve-month period and 3) track and recover, through
an annual surchargc, upstream1 transportation costs from customers. The filings were accepted effectiye September l,
1993, and made subject to refund pending review. Hearings have been instituted to review the recovery of the gas supply
realignment costs and the direct billing of unrecovered gas costs, Tennessee's filings to recover production costs related
to its Bastian Bay facilities have been rejected by the FERC based on the continued use of the gas production from the
ficld, however, the FERC recognized the ability of Tennessee to file for the recovery of losses upon disposition of these
assets, Tennessee will seek appellate review of the FERC actions. Tennessee is confident that the Bastian Bay costs will
ultimately be recovered as transition costs directly related to Order No. 636, and no FERC order has questioned the
ultimate recoverability of these costs,
The total amount of transition costs that will be incurred by Tennessee will depend upon: 1) developments in
restructuring proceedings involving lennessee, its customers and other affected parties, 2) the resolution of pending
litigation and 3) the terms of multiple negotiations with individual suppliers. Until these issues are resolved, Tennessee
cannot finally determine the ultimate amount of one-time realignmment costs or other related annual costs it will incur,
nor the amounts which will be recovered from customers. lennessee belieyes that onc-time realignment costs will not
exceed $700 million. At December 31, 1993, Tennessee recorded and deferred approximately $120 million of such one-
time costs which are recoverable from its customers. Tennessee belieyes that other related annual costs will not exceed
S100 million in 1994, decreasing thereafter over the length of the contracts involved.
The FERC Restructuring Orders will undergo judicial review, clarifications and formulation of cost recovery details
as the restructuring process proceeds. However, Tennessee believes that it is entitled to full recovery of all transition costs
it will incur. Given the fact that the FERC Restructuring Orders contemplate complete recovery by pipelines of qualified
transition costs, Tenneco believes that Tennessee's Order No. 636 restructuring (together with the Order No. 636
restructuring of Tenneco's other interstate pipclines) will not have a material effect on Tenneco's consolidated financial
position or results of opcrations.

Management's Report
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of USX Corporation and Subsidiary Companies
(USX) are the responsibility of and have been prepared by USX in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. They necessarily include some amounts that are based on best judgments and
estimates. The consolidated financial information displayed in other sections of this report is con-
sistent with that in these consolidated financial statements.
USX seeks to assure the objectivity and integrity of its financial records by careful selection of its
managers, by organizational arrangements that provide an appropriate division of responsibility and
by communications programs aimed at assuring that its policies and methods are understood
throughout the organization.
USX has a comprehensive formalized system of internal accounting controls designed to provide
reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that financial records are reliable. Appropriate
management monitors the system for compliance, and the internal auditors independently measure its
effectiveness and recommend possible improvements thereto. In addition, as part of their audit of the
consolidated financial statements, USX's independent accountants, who are elected by the stockholders,
review and test the internal accounting controls selectively to establish a basis of reliance thereon in
determining the nature, extent and timing of audit tests to be applied.
The Board of Directors pursues its oversight role in the area of financial reporting and internal
accounting control through its Audit Committee. This Committee, composed solely of nonmanagement
iirectors, regularly meets (jointly and separately) with the independent accountants, management and
.nternal auditors to monitor the proper discharge by each of its responsibilities relative to internal
accounting controls and the consolidated financial statements.
Report of Independent Accountants
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing on pages 34 through 56
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of USX Corporation and Subsidiary Companies
at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
These financial statements are the responsibility of USX's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for the opinion expressed above.
As discussed in Note l, page 40, in 1993 USX adopted new accounting standards for
postemployment benefits and for retrospectively rated insurance contracts. As discussed in Note 8,
page 45, and Note 9, page 46, in 1992 USX adopted new accounting standards for postretirement
benefits other than pensions and for income taxes, respectively.
Five-Year Financial Summary
T) OUISIAIEJIOLU)IE
The Westinghouse Electric Corporation has experienced
a tumultuous four years, In that time we have had four
chairmen, We have liquidated one major business and
divested two others (representing about 25 percent of our
1995 revenue), and incurred writeoffs of over $5 billion.
We have seen our core earnings decline by nearly 20 percent,
and reduced employment by 15 percent, Consequently.
there is a high degree of uncertainty among shareholders,
customers, employees, suppliers and financial institutions,
Icame to Westinghouse as an outsider, Frankly, after all
I had read about the company,l expected to find a hopeless
mess, But after rigorously analyzing every Westinghouse
business, issue and opportunity, I was very pleasantly
Second, we are simply going to run these businesses
better and more intensely than at any time in the past.
Im not saying weve run them badly; in fact, weve been
largely successful. But going forward, all of our people will
be searching intensely for improvement opportunities in
cost, product features and competitive position, To meet
our goals, these good businesses have to become out-
standing ones, with leadership in financial performance. All
Westinghouse employees-85,000 people-are committed
to that end.
Finally, we are going to run the total corporation in
a hands-on, informal fashion, blending initiative and
corporate perspective with speed of response and decision-
making. Were going to have a significantly smaller corpo-
rate center thats actively involved in supporting our
businesses, Were going to identify problems early, resolve
them fast, and marshal our people and investment resources
Changes in Accounting Principles
In December 1995, the Corporation adopted, retroactive to
January 1, 1995, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 112 'Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits.'' This statement requires employers to adopt accrual
accounting tor workers' compensation, salary continuation,
medical and life insurance continuation, severance benefits and
disability benefits provided to former or inactive employees
after employment but before retirement. See note 4 to the
financial statements.
Efective January 1, 1992, the Corporation adopted SFAS
No, 106, 'Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions,' on the immediate recognition basis.
This statement requires that the expected costs of providing
postretirement health care and life insurance benefits be
accrued during the employees' service with the Corporation.
The Corporations previous practice was to expense these costs
as incurred. See note 4 to the financial statements.
In the first quarter of 1992, the Corporation adopted the
provisions of SFAS No. 109,''Accounting for Income Taxes.''
This statement replaced SFAS No. 96, which the Corporation
previously used to account for income taxes. SFAS Nco. 109
permitted the Corporation to recognize certain deferred tax
benefits not recognized under SFAS No. 96. See note 5 to the
financial statements,
In December 1992, he Corporation adopted SFAS No. 107,
''Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments.'' This
statement is an extension of SFAS No. 105,''Disclosure of
Information about Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-
Sheet Risk and Financial Instruments with Concentrations of
Credit Risk,'' adopted in a prior year, and requires the disclosure
of the fair value of certain financial instruments, See note 22 to
the financial statements,
NOTE 2: DSCONTINUED OPERAIIONS
In November 1992, the Corporation announced the Plan that
included exiting the financial services business through the
disposition of its asset portfolios and the sale of other non-
strategic businesses. The Plan provided for the sale of real estate
and corporate finance portfolios over a three-year period and
the run-off of the leasing portfolio over a longer period of time
in accordance with contractual terms, Also, as part of the Plan,
the Corporation was to divest the following other non-strategic
operations: DCBU and'WESCO; Knoll; and WCI. Financial
Services and Other Operations have been accounted for as
discontinued operations in accordance with APB 30.
In [anuary 1994, the Corporation announced that the
planned sale of WCI will be accelerated from 1995 into 1994
and Knoll is no longer for sale. With respect to Knoll, the Cor-
porations strategy will now be directed to create shareholder
value by continuing to operate this business.
As a result of the adoption of the Plan, the Corporation
recorded in Discontinued Operations, during the fourth quarter
of 1992, a pre-tax charge of $2,201 million. This pre-tas charge
consisted of $2,550 million for an addition to the valuation
allowance for Financial Services portfolios, $500 million for esti-
mated losses from operations for Financial Services during the
phase-out period and $144 million for restructuring charges
related to the change in corporate strategy. These charges were
partially offset by an estimated $449 million gain from the dis-
position of Other Operations and an estimated $144 million of
earnings from those operations during the phase-out period.
Income tax benefits totalling $818 million were recorded in
connection with the Plan. The after-tax estimated loss on the
disposal of Discontinued Operations was $1,383 million. A
$56 million charge for corporate restructuring was recorded in
Continuing Operations in connection with the Plan.
In November 1992, in determining the valuation provision
for Financial Services real estate portfolio, management used
the Derived Investment Value (DIV) method. DIV is the
process developed by the Resolution Trust Corporation for use
in measuring the values of real estate owned and loans secured
by income-producing assets and land, In developing the provi-
sion for Financial Services corporate and leasing portfolios,
management used various techniques which considered a num-
ber of factors, including trading desk values with respect to the
corporate portfolio, and information provided by independent
consultants, Trading desk values arise from actual or proposed
current trades of identical or similar assets. These valuation
processes provided portfolio valuations that reflect the strategy
of exiting the financial services business. Under the Corpora-
tions previous strategy of downsizing Financial Services over a
period of up to five years and holding certain assets for the long
term, the methods used to value assets resulted in higher asset
values net of valuation allowances.
The estimated gain from the disposition of Other Operations
was determined by management using various techniques and
assumptions which considered, among other factors, index
multiples derived for comparable businesses as appropriately
adjusted to reflect the characteristics of the businesses within
Other Operations.
Variances from estimates which may occur will be considered
in determining if an adjustment of the estimated loss on disposal
of Discontinued Operations is necessary.
Since adoption of the Plan, the Corporation has made
significant progress in disposing of Financial Services assets.
On August 11, 1993, the Corporation announced an agree-
ment to sell the majority of DCBU to Eaton Corporation for a
purchase price of $1.1 billion and the assumption by the buyer
of certain liabilities. The Corporation completed this sale on
January 31, 1994.
On February 16, 1994, the Corporation announced an agree-
ment to sell WESCO to an affiliate of Clayton, Dubilier 5
Rice, Inc., a private investment firm, for a purchase price of
approximately $540 million. The Corporation completed this
sale on February 28, 1994.
The reserve for the estimated loss on the disposal of
Discontinued Operations established in November 1992 con-
sisted of an addition to the valuation allowance for Financial
Services portfolios, estimated future results of operations and
sales proceeds to be obtained from Discontinued Operations,
as well as estimates as to the timing of the divestitures and
assumptions regarding other relevant factors.
During 1993, the Corporation reviewed its estimates of
proceeds from the disposal of Discontinued Operations and the
operating income or loss that would be generated by these busi-
nesses during their disposal periods, Through the third quarter
of 1995, the Corporation had favorable experience with the sale
of Financial Services assets, selling them at prices in excess of
original estimates and on a more accelerated schedule than was
anticipated at the time the Plan was developed. The more rapid
liquidation of the assets had the effect of reducing the earned
income from the Financial Services assets during the disposal
period, which, to a large degree, offset the favorable price expe-
rience from the asset sales, In addition, the marketing process
for Other Operations indicated that expected proceeds would
be less than the initial forecast. Through the third quarter of
1995, all of these factors were reviewed and considered to be
largely offsetting.
In the fourth quarter of 1993, the Corporation recorded
an additional provision for loss on disposal of Discontinued
Operations of $148 million, pre-tax or $95 million, after-tax.
This change in the estimated loss resulted from additional
information, obtained through negotiation activity, regarding
the expected selling prices of WESCO and the Australian sub-
sidiary of DCBU. Also contributing to this provision was a
decision to bulk sell a Financial Services residential develop-
ment that the Corporation, upon adoption of the Plan, had
intended to transfer to WCI for development. These matters
and a revision to the estimated interest costs expected to be
incurred by the Discontinued Operations during the disposal
period resulted in the additional fourth quarter provision.
The reserve for the estimated loss on the disposal of Discon-
tinued Operations may require adjustment in future periods to
reflect changes in any of the above constituent elements, which
may be affected by adverse economic, market or other factors
beyond what was anticipated at December 51, 1993.
Management has considered all of the above factors and
believes that the reserve for the estimated loss on disposal of
Discontinued Operations should be adequate. The adequacy of
this reserve is evaluated each quarter, and the actual experience
and any changes in expectations will be considered in determin-
ing whether adjustment to the reserve is required.
In accordance with APB 30, the consolidated financial state-
ments reflect the operating results of Discontinued Operations
separately from Continuing Operations, Prior periods have
peen restated. Summarized operating results of Discontinued
Dperations follow:
Highlights
The deferred tas (liabilities) assets are comprised of the following:
Key medical nutritional products also
include kity a tube-feeding product;
Gluarna, for patients with abnormal
glucose tolerance; Netro for hemodialysis
patients; and Prative and Alitra(] with
glutamine, two products for critically
ill patients.
To expand the U.S. retail market for
Emre products, Abbott launched a
national radio, television and print advertis-
ing oumpaign emphasizing the benefits of
good nutrition and nutritions cost-effective
role in overall health care, particularly for
older adults,
In international markets, Enare. f:ity
Gluarna and an array of other specialized
products increasingly are being used by
patients recovering from surgery or those
with other medical problems. Over the
last five years, sales of medical nutritional
products have grown steadily in Europe,
while experiencing strong growth in Japan,
Canada and several countries in Latin
America and Asia.
Abbott continues to seek growth oppor-
tunities with the introduction of new, more
effective feeding devices to support its
medical nutritional products, Introduced
in 1995, he Fleifl+ Lap G Lparoscopic
Gastrostomy Kit uses laparoscopy, a mini-
mally invasive technique, for gastrostomy
tube placement. A second procedural kit
using laparoscopic technology for feeding
tube placement is expected to be intro-
duced in 1994.
The (wantsm pump, ntroduced in
1992, has gained excellent market acceptance
as an innovative, effective device for enteral
feeding. The automated system has a self-
flushing capability, which decreases the
incidence of tube-clogging. This feature
improves feeding efficiency and reduces
labor costs.
Pediatric Nutritionals
With its well-established Siwilac and
omuil brands, and a broad line of products
for the special nutritional needs of infants
and children, Abbott is the leading infant
formula manufacturer in the U.S. The
company maintained its leadership posi-
tion in 1995 despite highly competitive
market conditions.
Abbott has responded to changing
market conditions with new products and
marketing approaches. A line extension
was introduced for Abbotts lomil brand,
the leading soy formula in the U.S. owuil
DF (Diarrhea Formulation), a patented
product, was launched as the first infant
formula clinically shown to shorten the
duration of loose, watery stools during
diarrhea in infants.
For the special nutritional needs of
children ages to 10, Abbott introduced
PaiaSure WYb Fi&r The product helps
normalize bowel function. Both PdiaSure
and PdiaSwre Eib Fier provide complete
liquid nutrition for children with chronic
conditions that prevent normal eating or
require long-term tube feeding. The
products also may be used for children
recovering from trauma or illness, in
preparation for or recovery from surgery.
or as an everyday nutritional supplement
with or between meals.
A new system of 17 highly specialized
nutritionals designed for the nutritional
management of infants, children and adults
with metabolic disorders was launched in
199% The Ross Metabolic Formula System
provides nutritional products necessary
from birth through adulthood for patients
who must observe lifetime dietary restric-
tions to avoid serious developmental
problems. These products are sold on the
recommendation of physicians.
Also introduced was Pdialyte Bubble
Gum Flavor, a pleasant-tasting oral elec-
trolyte solution for maintenance of fluids
and minerals lost in diarrhea, a potentially
dangerous condition for infants and children.
PdialyteBubble Gum Flavor helps
to improve compliance, especially among
toddlers and older children for whom
flavor may be an issue. The Pdialyte line of
products is being promoted nationwide in
television and print advertisements.
In international markets, the company
continues to expand its infant nutritional
business with new products and further
penetration of emerging markets in
Latin Ameriaa and the Pacific Rim. Gaic.
Abbotts follow-on formula for older babies,
is achieving excellent growth in several
international markets, including Taiwan,
che Philippines and Hong Kong
Supporting Education
For over 25 years, Abbott has supported a variety of
education programs, with a special emphasis on attracting
students to the technical and scientific fields that serve as
the backbone of Abbott Laboratories.
5Tirls and Science: Linkages for the Future'' encourages
young women to enter science and engineering. In conjunc-
tion with the American Association for the Advancement
of Science (AAAS) and with volunteer support from
Abbott employees, the company sponsored training work-
shops for Girl Scout councils in Illinois andd Wisconsin at
the corporate headquarters, AAAS instructors taught troop
leaders how to conduct hands-on science and math experi-
ments. The program will potentially reach more than
20000 Girl Scouts. More than 50 Abbott scientists and
engineers volunteered to act as role models for the troops.
In Barceloneta, Puerto Rico, Abbott is underwriting a
similar AAAS program focusing on science and math skills
for Hispanic students. Fifty elementary school teachers
learned a variety of scientific experiments appropriate for
their classrooms and will share their training with other
teachers, Abbott also donated materials and is providing
technical support from Abbott employee volunteers.
7dvancing Minorities'lnterest in Engineering AMIE):
A Coalition of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and
Fortune Companies'' a newly created alliance, is the outcome
of an Abbott-sponsored initiative. Together, member cor-
porations and the nine historically black schools in the
U.S. are working to increase the opportunities available for
minorities to pursue and succeed in engineering careers.
THOICES'' is a program presented to ninth-graders by
trained Abbott employee volunteers who visit students in
their classrooms. Through exercises and discussions, these
volunteers help children understand that staying in school
gives them more choices in life. CHOICES is an excellent
example of how the educational and business communities
can work together to prepare students for adult life.
Caring for the Environment
Abbotts corporate philosophy is that business leaders also
must be environmental leaders, and that the companys
actions today will have an impact on future generations.
The company focuses on the three ''Rs'' of environmental
protection: reduce, reuse and recycle. Abbott continually
assesses thousands of manufacturing processes, products
and packages to determine how they can be made more
environmentally friendly.
Reducing the volume of material put into a product helps
to lower manufacturing and disposal costs. for example,
decreasing the width of a plastic wall by only a fraction of
an inch in a disposable cartridge used in an Abbott Viion
blood analyzer takes on new significance when that piece is
reproduced several hundred thousand times each year.
One of the best alternatives to disposing of waste
is selling it to another company that can use it in a
manufacturing process, For example, some Abbott manu-
facturing byproducts are used to clean printing presses and
in windshield washer solvent.
In the U.S., Abbott recycles approsimately 50 million
pounds of material each year. fpproximately one-third of
this amount is paper and cardboard boxes. The remainder
includes plastic, glass, aluminum and steel.
Abbott Donations
Abbott donations include both products given to worldwide
relief efforts and cash contributions made to educational,
health, human service, civic and cultural organizations.
Employee gifts to hospitals, schools and public broadcasting
stations are matched dollar-for-dollar by the company
Generous employee and corporate gifts to United Way
fund-raising campaigns at Abbott facilities totaled
$4.5 million in 1995
In 1995; The Clara Abbott Foundation, which is incor-
porated as an independent entity, awarded more than
$5 million in educational grants to the children of Abbott
employees and retirees in 199 The foundation also pro-
vided Abbott employees and retirees with funds to meet
unexpected financial difficulties such as medical expenses
and loans to replace homes damaged by natural disasters,
Equal Employment Opportunity
It is the policy of Abbott Laboratories to provide equal
opportunity in all areas of its employment practices without
regard to race, color, religion, national origin, ses, age,
ancestry, citizenship, disability, veteran status, marital status,
sexual orientation or any other reason prohibited by law.
Of the investment securities listed above, $295888,
$409105, and $424,218, were held at December 5, 1995;
1992, and 1991, respectively, by subsidiaries operating
in Puerto Rico under tax incentive grants expiring from
2002 through 2007 In addition, these subsidiaries held
cash equivalents of $197.200, $55,800, and $4000 at
December 51, 1995; 1992, and 1991, respectively
Note 5 - Taxes on Earnings
(dollarr i tbouaands)
Effective January 1, 1995; the Company adopted the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 109, Accounting for Income Tases'' This statement
requires that deferred income taxes reflect the tax conse-
quences on future years of differences between the tax bases
of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts.
Prior to 1995, provisions were made for the estimated amount
of income taxes on reported earnings which were payable
currently and in the future. The effect of this change on
income before taxes and net income was not significant, and
prior years financial statements have not been restated.
U.S. income taxes are provided on those earnings of for-
eign subsidiaries and subsidiaries operating in Puerto Rico
under tax incentive grants, which are intended to be
remitted to the parent company Undistributed earnings
reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries as working
capital and plant and equipment aggregated $702000 at
December 51, 1995 Deferred income taxes not provided
on these earnings are not significant.
As of December 51, 1995; total deferred tax assets were
$652,l12 and total deferred tas liabilities were $211,839.
Valuation allowances for tax assets are not significant. The
major temporary differences that give rise to deferred tax
assets are compensation and employee benefits ($146,505).
valuation and exposure reserves for inventory and accounts
receivable ($86005 and $91,59, tespectively), deferred
intercompany profit ($72,129), and state income taxes
($50715) The use of accelerated depreciation for U.S.
income tax purposes ($165;482) and employee benefits
($52,578) are the primary temporary differences that give
rise to deferred tax liabilities.
WHISKY PRODUCER WITH ITS ACOUISITION OF INVERGORDON DISTILLERS GROUP PLC.
Our distilled spirits business
had another strong year, with
operating company contribu-
tion up 13'% despite intensified
pricc compctition and a decline
in revenues of (6%.
Markct share improved for
key products in Jim Beam's core
portfolio, although adverse eco-
nommic conditions in many
world markets continued to
depress demand and U.S. con-
sumption continued its long-
term declinc.
The company's flagship
Jim Bcam bourbon, 1 in the
world, further strengthcncd its
leadership position with world-
wide sales of nearly 5 million
cases, In the U.S., Bookers and
other small batch bourbons
achieved further growth.
Kcssler again increased its
share of the American blended
whiskey market, while
DeKuyper retained its position
as the nation's @1 selling line of
cordials.
Jim Beam Brands is the sec-
ond largest seller of U.S. bot-
tled Canadian whisky with
lindsor Canadian and Lord
Calert. Beam has a 28% share
of this category which contin-
ued to outperform spirits in
general.
Kamora increased unit vol-
ume, strengthening its position
as the @2 imported coffee
liqueur. Wlfchmidt vodka
increased volume by over 1(0%.
Beam's international sales
incrcased 1(00%, with volume
increases in all kcy markets
including Australia, where
Jim Beam is the largest selling
distilled spirit of any type and
has over half the bourbon
market.
In November, U.K.-based
Whyte &: Mackay completed
the acquisition of Invergordon,
propelling the group to the @3
position in the world scotch
whisky business, Even exclud-
ing any benefits from the acqui-
sition, Whytc & Mackay
achieved a 28% increase in con-
tribution and its share of the
LU.K. scotch whisky market
increased to around 15'%4.
ITadiar strengthened its
position as the 2 vodka in the
LU.K. with a 12.6% increase in
unit volum1e.
comparisons will improve as the year progresses and that
full year results for 1994 will approximate 1993's result.
In addition to the previously discussed increases in U.S.
and U.K. tobacco excise taxes, the Clinton administra-
tion has proposed increasing the tax on cigarettes from 24
cents to 99 cents per pack, Legislation has also been intro-
duced in the U.S. Congress that would increase excise
taxes on cigarettes. The effects of any of the foregoing
cannot be determined but will likely add to the overall
industry declines and the shift to lower priced brands. In
addition, further restrictions on advertising and use of
tobacco products in the U.S., the U.K, and elsewhere are
possible. N change in timing of the U.K. budget resulted
in a second budget announcement on November 30,
1993, and thereafter will be at about the same time each
year. This change had the effect of drawing significant
sales into the fourth quarter of 1993 from the first quarter
cof 1994. As a result, the first quarter 1994 comparison
will be especially difficult as 1993'4 first quarter benefited
from trade buying in anticipation of the March U.K.
budget increase.
Recent legislation restricts the use of imported tobacco
in UU.S. manufactured cigarettes. Based on the prelimi-
nary rules issued, the impact of this legislation may
increase American Tobacco's 1994 manufacturing cost by
an estimated $10 million.
1992 counpared t, 199]
Revenues increased 1% and operating income increased
2%. Worldwide cigarette unit sales decreased 3.8%.
International tobacco revenues in sterling increased
slightly as price increases, which principally resulted
from higher U.K. tobacco taxes, line extensions and new
products were largely offset by a 10.9% decline in U.K.
cigarette unit sales. The U.K. industry declined 6.7%.
Export sales increased principally on shipments of ciga-
rettes to markets in the C.I.S. The U.K. budgets,
announced in March 1992 and March 1991, each provided
for an increase in taxes on tobacco products with the
result that the tax on a pack of cigarettes increased 13
pence and 22 pence, respectively. The decline in unit sales
reflected the continuing impact of price increases, includ-
ing the effect of substantial excise tax increases, which,
combined with the prolonged recession, reduced industry
volumes and led to greater price competition and
increased trading down by consumers to lower priced
brands. These changes particularly affected Gallaher, the
majority of whose sales are in the premium sector.
Despite the decline in unit sales, Gallaher maintained its
position as the @1 tobacco company in the U.K. with an
estimated 41.5% cigarette market share for 1992, com-
pared to 43.5% in 1991. Operating income in sterling was
up 6% on higher gross margin, favorable comparison to
the 1991 provision for workforce reductions and lower
expenses. Dollar revenues and operating income percent-
age changes approximated the sterling results,
Record domestic tobacco revenues increased 3% on
price increases and unit gains in price-value brands,
resulting from product introductions and exports, partly
offset by substantial unit declines in premium brands.
American Tobacco's U.S. unit sales were down 4.3%,
while industry unit sales declined slightly, and market
share for the year was 6.76% compared to 7.03% for
1991. Price-value brands accounted for 45% of American
Tobacco's U.S. unit sales, compared with 38% in 1991.
Operating income declined 1'% on substantially higher
promotional expenses to meet competitive activity and
less favorable product mix, almost offset by price increase
benefits and reductions in coupon redemption accruals,

199.{ ciomparcd . 1992
Revenues decreased 6% while record operating income
in 1993 rose 10%.
Beam's revenues were down 5% on lower domestic
volume principally reflecting competitive pricing pres-
sures, the effect of lower foreign exchange rates and a
domestic bulk sale last year. U.S. distilled spirits con-
sumption continued its long-term decline. Worldwide
branded case sales were down 1.7% and domestic
branded cases declined 4.6%. Record operating income
was up slightly on the timing of operating expenses and
higher margins, partly offset by higher international sell-
ing costs. With recent heavy price competition and con-
sumer rebates, margins may well be under pressure as the
intensifying competitive situation may limit future price
increases.
Whyte & Mackay revenues in sterling were up 6% on
inclusion of Invergordon for one month and higher vol-
ume, mainly in export markets, partly offset by 1992'e
significant level of bulk sales. Excluding Invergordon,
worldwide case sales were up 10.4% and U.K. case sales
were up 6.5%. Translated at substantially lower average
foreign exchange rates, revenues were down 9% in dol-

During the year, the Company issued $150 million of
7%% Debentures, Due 2023. The net proceeds from this
issuance was used for general corporate purposes, includ-
ing the repayment of outstanding debt. During 1993,
$75 million of 9%% Notes and $20 million in Medium
Term Notes matured.
At December 31, 1993, the Company had $850 million
of debt securities (including Medium Term Notes) avail-
able for sale under its shelf registration with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
At year end, the Company had $4 billion of long-term
credit facilities, of which $3.8 billion remained unused.
These facilities are available for general corporate pur-
poses, including acquisitions and support of the Com-
pany's short-term borrowings in the commercial paper
market. In addition, Gallaher has committed short-term
revolving credit agreements of 300 million (approxi-
mately $444 million) which are available for general cor-
porate purposes, including acquisitions.
The Company believes that its internally generated
funds, together with its access to global credit markets,
are more than adequate to meet its capital needs.
Working capital decreased from $664.4 million in 1992
to $575.4 million in 1993. Management believes this is an
adequate level to support continued growth.
Life insurance net assets were $1.3 billion, up $69.8

Franklin is restricted by the insurance laws of the State of
Illinois as to amounts that can be transferred to the Com-
pany in the form of dividends, loans or advances without
approval of the Director of Insurance. This restriction has
not had and is not expected to have a material effect on
the ability of the Company to meet its cash obligations.
Life insurance investments in 1993 increased by $487.6
million primarily reflecting increases in fixed maturities
and mortgage loans.
At December 31, 1993, the unrealized gain on
Franklin's held-to-maturity portfolio was $467.1 million.
I 1993, independent insurance analysts continued to
rate Franklin highly in terms of financial strength.
Franklin has consistently followed a conservative invest-
ment program and has maintained a high-quality port-
folio. At year-end, only 4.5% of Franklin's held-to-
maturity portfolio was in non-investment grade
securities, Its mortgage loans represented 9.2% of its
investment portfolio, and its non-performing assets com-
prised less than 1%.
earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested in
these companies,
Under insurance tax laws in effect for years prior to
1984, a portion of Franklin's accumulated statutory
income has not been subject to tax. Should the aggre-
gated untaxed income exceed certain prescribed maxi-
mums or cash dividends to the Company exceed the
accumulated taxed portion, the excess would be subject
to federal income tax. Taxes of $70 million calculated
using the current federal statutory income tax rate have
not been provided on the untaxed income, which aggre-
gated $201 mmillion at December 31, 1993, since Franklin
does not contemplate distributing such income in the
foreseeable future.
Earuings Per Share
Earnings per CCommmon share are based on the weighted
average number of Common shares outstanding in each
year and after preferred stock dividend requirements,
Fully diluted earnings per Common share assume that
any convertible debentures and convertible preferred
shares outstanding at the beginning of each year or at
their date of issuance, if later, were converted at those
dates, with related interest, preferred stock dividend
requirements and outstanding Common shares adjusted
accordingly. It also assumes that outstanding Common
shares were increased by shares issuable upon exercise of
those stock options for which market price exceeds exer-
cise price, less shares which could have been purchased by
the Company with related proceeds.

On March 19, 1993, he Company acquired M. Polaner, Inc.
(Polaner), a manufacturer of jams, for $67,500,000 in a
purchase transaction. The excess of the purchase price over the
net assets acquired was approximately $65,600,000.
In January 1992, the Company acquired a majority interest
in Genetics Institute, Inc. (G.1.), a biopharmaceutical company.
The Company acquired approximately 40% of G.I.s outstand-

approximately 9,500,000 newly issued shares of G.I, common
stock for $300,000,000. The total consideration paid by the
Company for the approximate 60% interest in G.I, was
$666,000,000. The purchase price esceeded the net tangible
assets acquired by approximately $365,000,000 of which
$220,000,000 was attributable to acquired research and was
expensed as a special charge in 1992. The unamortized goodwill
at December 31, 1993 was $164,000,000 inclusive of addi-
tional share purchases of 40,000 and 907,000 shares in 1993
and 1992, respectively, bringing the Companys total ownership
at December 31, 1995 to approximately 64%. The Company
holds an option to acquire the remaining shares of G.I, from
the public shareholders over a five-year period ending Decem-

January 1, 1994, the option price per share was $64.74. The
Company has the right to acquire additional shares through
open market or privately negotiated purchases, provided that its
aggregate holdings do not exceed 75%4 of G.I.s outstanding

borrowings, increased to $966 million at September %0, 1994,
from $69 million at September 24, 1993 Ths mmcrease reflects a

also attrbutable to the Companys continued efforts to increase
profit levels and to manage working capital. particularly m the
area of inventory management.
More cash was generated by operations in 199i compared
wih 1995, primaril because of a significant decrease mn inventory
levels, as well as increased sales levels. The significant decrease iin
nventory levels durng 1994 resulted from improved inventory
managemient, higher 199i sales levels attributable to various
pricing and promotional actions, and strong sales of new product
inventory that had been built up iin preparation for the intro-
duction of Power Macintosh. Profit levels improved as operating

Restricted Stock Plan
On April 1, 1993; the Companys Board of Directors approved
a Restricted Stock Plan for officers of the Company (the RSP),
which became effectre ]uly 1, 1995 The RSP was subsequentl
ratified by the shareholders on January 26, 1994. The RSPis
designed to provide an incentie for officers to continue to own
shares of the Companys common stock acquired upon exercise
of options under any of the Companys Stock Option Plans, thus
more closely aligning officers' financial interests with those of the
shareholders. The RSP provides that officers who esercise stock
options and continue to hold the exercised shares for at least
three years will receive up to three Awards of shares of restricted
stock. Each such Award s fxr one-third the number of shares
held for the requisite retention period. Each restricted stock
Award granted purrsuant to the plan becomes fully vested three
years after the grantdate, provided that the officer maintains
continuous employment with the Company and that other
vesting requirements are met.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Commmpany has an employee stock purchase plan (the
Purchase Plan) under which substantially all employees may
purchase common stock through payroll deductions at a price
equal to 85% of the lower of the fir market values as of the
beginning or end of the offering period. Stock purchases under
the Purchase Plan are limited to 10 of an employees compen-
sation, up to amaximum of $25000 in any calendar year As of
September 50, 1994, approsimatelv l million shares were
reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.
Stock Repurchase Programs
In November 1992, he Board of Directors authorized the
purchase of up to l0 million shares of the Companys common
stock in the open market. No shares were repurchased under this
authorization in 199i, while approsimately 5.-4 million shares
were repurchased under this authoriation in 1995. In September
1990, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to
10 million shares of the Companys common stock in he open
market. Durng 1995 and 1992, he Company repurchased the
remaining shares under this authorization, which approximated
to 16 million and 40 milhon shares, respectively.
Savings Plan
The Company has an employee savings plan (the Savings Plan)
that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section
401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the Savings Plan,
participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pretas
earnings, up to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution
lmit ($9.2) for calendar year 1994). Effectie July 1, 1994, he

In terms of current markets, Japan
and the European UUnion comprise hy
far the largest share of Baxter's
international husiness today, But the
long-term opportunities are equally
attractive in the developing nations of
Asia, Latin America and the former
Soviet bloc, where Baxter is establishing
a major presence.
T n developing nations,economic and
i medical development are closely
L related. As countries create more
wealth and more income, one of the first
things they spend it on is health care.
Even relatively small increases in
spending on health care create
significant opportunities for Baxter.
'*We're not talking about levels of
medical spending that approach those in
the United States,,.,'' Baez says, ''we're
talking about countries taking the
next step up. For example, if Chile's
medical spending as a share of its gross
domestic product were raised to the level
of Spain's, it would increase roughly
50 percent.''
In the developing countries
overall, medical spending per capita is
projected to douhle in the 19904. One of
the most promising areas is East Asia

Baxter today is one of the largest

in peritoneal dialysis and intravenous

base in 1994.
Also in 1994, Baxter hopes to
conclude joint-venture agreements in
India, Indonesia and Thailand for plants
to manufacture dialysis and IV solutions.
''These are significant opportunities,'
Baez says, ''There are almost 900 million
people in India, nearly 190 million in
Indonesia, Thailand has about the same
population as England or France, In all
these areas, we're using entry-level
technology and various kinds of business
arrangements to get established quickly.
From there, we'll branch out.''
Nowhere in Asia, however, is the
population - and the opportunity -
larger than in China, That country is
poised for an era of rapid growth. Some
experts believe (China's economy will

The teamwork approach extends to
the multihospital-system arena as well.

hospital teams and meet the needs of
multihospital systems as 'One Baster,'''
says Terrance J. Mulligan, group vice

In the past, as many as 30 Baster
sales representatives may have called on
one hospital. Under the new organization,
an account manager, supported by sales
representatives from each of Baxter's
businesses, will represent Baxter as a
team to that customer.
The new structure puts customer
needs ahead of divisional priorities. It
breaks down old divisional conflicts or
inefficiencies. For example, in 1993,
California Healthcare System (CHS), a
regional alliance of four hospitals in the
San Francisco Bay area, sought to reduce
its supply expenses by seeking a prime-
vendor relationship for all four of its
hospitals. Baxter won the contract, based
largely on the teamwork involved in
presenting the company's capabilities in
a way that addressed all areas of need
outlined by CHS.
''I look at CHS as a model for how

focus on improving its cash flows from operations,
Management expects that net debt at the end of 1994 will
be the same as the 1993 year-end level, before the
consideration of net proceeds from divestitures. The company
also intends to utilize the net proceeds from the planned
divestiture of the diagnostics-products manufacturing and
other non-strategic businesses to reduce net deht, and thus,
anticipates that its net debt to net capital will decline
during 1994, with the goal of reaching the 40% range in the
years ahead.
The companys debt ratings of Aß on senior debt by
Moodys, A- by Standard & Poors and A by Duff & Phelps
were reaffirmed by each rating agency after the 1993 restruc-
turing announcement. Standard & Poor's and Duff & Phelps
have indicated that continuation of these ratings in the future
is dependent on Baxters successful implementation of the
restructuring program announced in November 1993 (dis-
cussed previously) and the reduction of its financial leverage
which is expected to result from the planned divestiture of its
diagnostics-products manufacturing businesses,
At December 31, 1993, the company could issue up
to $300 million in aggregate principal amount of additional
senior unsecured debt securities under an effective
registration statement filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
The company intends to fund its long-term obligations
as they mature by issuing additional debt or through cash
flow from operations. The company believes it has lines of
credit adequate to support ongoing operational and
restructuring requirements. Beyond that, the company
believes it has sufficient financial flesibility to attract long-
term capital on acceptable terms as may be needed to support
its growth objectives.

The consolidated balance sheets of Baxter International Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related
consolidated statements of income, cash flows and stockholders'
equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 1903, have been prepared by management, which
is responsible for their integrity and objectivity, The statements
have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles and include some amounts that are based
upon management's best estimates and judgments, The financial
intormation contained elsewhere in this annual report is consis-
tent with that contained in the financial statements.
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
a system of internal control designed to provide reasonable
assurance as to the integrity and reliability of financial reporting.
The concept of reasonable assurance is based on the recognition
that there are inherent limitations in all systems of internal
control, and that the cost of such systems should not exceed the
benefits to be derived therefrom.
Management believes that the foundation of an appropriate
system of internal control is a strong ethical company culture
and climate. To this end the Corporate fesponsibility office was
created in 1993 to recommend to the Public Policy Committee of
the Board of Directors, revisions to the company's existing ethics
and compliance policies, and to direct the implementation of and
compliance with the company's ethics and compliance policies
and procedures, The Corporate fesponsibility office monitors
compliance through audit programs and the requirement for
annual representations by senior managers. Additionally, a pro-
fessional staff of corporate auditors reviews the related internal
control system design, the accounting policies and procedures
supporting this system and compliance therewith. The results of
these reviews are reported annually to the Public Policy and
Audit Committees.

To Our Customers, Shareholder, Employees and Friends
CITGO had a challenging and fantastic year in 1993. It reminded me of one of my favorite CIIGO
advertisements, the one that says, ''First we learned to walk. Then we learned to run. Now we're ready to fly.''
This past year was a mini-version of the CITGO success story told by that advertisement. The first quarter of 1993
was among the poorest earnings periods in our history - you might say we were barely walking. We picked up our
pace in the second quarter and hit our stride in the third. By the end of 1993, CITGO had experienced its most
successful year ever. Income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was up 35 percent.
Safety performance was outstanding, coming extremely close to 1992s record. Sales of CITGO products were up,
and our refineries were safe, clean, and reliable. We continued our strategic growth trend, acquiring a 28,000 bpd
asphalt refinery in Savannah, Georgia, in April and joining forces with Houston-based Lyondell Petrochemical
Company to form LYONDELL-CITGO Refining Company, Ltd, in July. In sum, 1993 was a very good
year for CITGO.
CITGOW 1993 net income of $162.1 million on revenues of $9.1 billion compared very favorably to 1992s net
income of $33.2 million on revenues of $9.2 billion - a 35 percent increase when the accounting change adopted in
1992 is excluded. Income from operations for 1993 was $340.1 million, compared with $310.0 million in 1992.
While our financial performance was impressive, I am equally pleased with CITGOs 1993 safety performance.
CITGOW 1993 total OSHA Recordable Incidence rate of 2.2 very nearly matched 1992s record-breaking
performance, while the lost workday case rate of 1.2 tied our 1992 record. Both CITGOs incidence and lost
workday rates were among the best in the industry.
But its not the numbers Im proud of as much as it is the people - CITGO employees - who made them possible.
Safety is not a numbers game. It is about taking the right steps, every minute of every day, to ensure that all of us
return safely to our families at the end of the day. CITGOs five-year trend of sustained safety performance is proof
positive that our safety strategy is a long-term and effective one.
While we invested close to $100 million in 1993 on environmentally related projects, it was once again our people
who helped to ''keep it clean.'' Through recycling, source control, pollution prevention teams, education, and
awareness, CITGO employees fulfilled our commitment to environmental stewardship. From the manufacturing, to
the packaging, to the transportation of our products, we are dedicated to protecting the environment.
The past year was also highlighted by outstanding sales performances from every CIIGO business unit.
Gasoline sales to distributors increased 19 percent to five billion gallons in 1993, while rack distillate and jet turbine
sales volumes rose 244 percent and 12 percent, respectively. Lubricants sales volumes to distributors were up
5 percent over 1992 levels, despite an industry-wide decline in demand, while refined wax sales saw a re
The Companys asphalt business enables CITGO to diversify its earnings base
while providing PDVSA an outlet for nearly 15 million barrels annually of its
extra-heavy crude. In 1993, PDVSA-CITGO synergies continued to expand as
CARCO marketed one million barrels of asphalt from PDVSA affiliate
Lagoven in 1993.
CARCOs refinery in Paulsboro, New Jersey, ran a record-setting ll.3 million
barrels of crude, a 4.1 percent increase over 1992 levels. An emphasis on safety
earned refinery employees an NPRA Gold Award, while an environmental
focus led to the recycling of 4.6 million pounds of solid waste into
highway paving material.
Employees at CARCOs headquarters in Blue Bell, Tennsylvania, worked
hand-in-hand with employees at the Savannah refinery to ensure the smooth
incorporation of the refinery into CIIGO operations at the start of the asphalt
season. Production at Savannah was excellent, as the refinery, in eight
months of CITGO operation, ran 3.5 million barrels of crude - 96 percent
of the total 1992 runs.
Equally impressive was the fact that CARCOs marketing and terminal
operations realized a savings of 30 cents per barrel in asphalt terminaling and
transportation costs, as waste elimination efforts increased and six of eleven
terminals were automated. CARCOW ''Vision 94' is bright indeed, as plans
call for automation of at least three more terminals and expansion into
the Albany, New York, market.

zvvolumes jumped 36 percent
over 1992 levels to 10.3
million barrels of asphalt,
and CITGOs asphalt
refineries set production
records and achieved
significant safety
milestones, In May, the
Company became the
larsgest asphalt producer on
the East Coast when a
28,000 bpd asphalt refinery
in Savannah, Georgia, wtas
successfully incorporated
into CITGO operations.
Productivity and cost control improvements contributed to profitability
and were largely responsible for the Company's ability to buck negative trends
in the petrochemicals market. A new benzene splitter came on-line at the
Lake Charles facility, increasing production 28 percent over 1992 levels.
Polymer propylene production of 312 million pounds set a new record and
represented an ll percent increase over 1992. At Corpus Christi, aromatics
production increased 4 percent, reducing CITGOs dependence on
outside feedstock suppliers.
Petrochemicals customers recognized CITGO's commitment to customer
satisfaction. Monsanto presented CITCO Petrochemicals its Preferred
Cyclohexane Supplier Award for the fifth consecutive year, and cumene
customer General Electric Plastics continued to honor CITGO as a Partner in
Ouality. In early 1994, CITGOs cyclohexane and cumene processes at the
Corpus Christi refinery were recommended for I5O 9002 certification,
reflecting thousands of hours of work in 1993 by a cross-functional team of
engineers, laboratory personnel and operations representatives.
Ytrochemicals
CITGOs petrochemicals
production and sales
reached record highs in
1993, despite a declining
international market. As
employees sought new
vays of eliminating waste
and improving quality,
sales volumes increased by
II percent and profits by
1.9 percent, CITGO
produced and sold a
record-setting amount of
cyclohexane in 1993 -
7 percent more than
in 1992,
Off Balance Sheet Risk Information as of December 31, 1993
The Company has guaranteed approximately $22 million of debt of certain affiliates, CIIGO
distributors and other parties which is substantially collateralized by assets of these entities. The
Company has outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $174 million, which includes $131
million related to LYONDELL-CIIGO (Note 2)and $30 million related to the Company's industrial
development bonds (Note 9). The Company has also acquired surety bonds totaling $18 million
primarily due to requirements of various government entities. The Company is exposed to credit loss in
the event of nonperformance by the other parties to the interest rate swap agreements (Note 9).
however, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.
.LEASES
The Company leases certain of its Corpus Christi refinery facilities under a long-term lease. The basic
term of the lease expires on January l, 2004; however, the Company may renew the lease until anuary
31, 2011, the date of its purchase option. Capitalized costs included in property, plant and equipment
related to the leased assets were approximately $209 million at December 31, 1993 and 1992.
Accumulated amortization related to the leased assets was approximately $62 million and $54 million at
December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Amortization is included in depreciation expense.
The Company also has various noncancellable operating leases, primarily for office space, computer
equipment and vehicles. Rent expense on all operating leases totaled $34 million and $35 million in 1993
and 1992. Future minimum lease payments for the capital lease and noncancellable operating leases are
as follows:
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Capital Accounts
Management
The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
The decrease in the deferred tax assets valuation allowance in 1993 of $11 million is primarily attributable to the
utilization (or expected future utilization) of loss carryforwards associated with certain of the Company's foreign
subsidiaries.
Deferred tax assets of $126 million and $78 million were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets
at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

Ongoing quality programs, such as Total Ouality Excellence at
Corn Products in North America, Total Ouality in Colombia, and a
plan called Terra Nova in Brazil, continue to yield improved cus-
tomer satisfaction ratings, Ouality-driven performance also earns
the corn refining business the chance to partner with customers
on future business opportunities, In Latin America customer sur-
veys were initiated to establish a quality and service benchmark
for future improvement.
CPCs corn refining business is well positioned to take advan-
tage of the new, more open economies, as trade barriers fall
worldwide and countries change policies to increase cross-bor-
der business, CPC is the only corn refiner with plants in Canada,
Mexico, and the U.S., and the passage of the North American
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will allow for more sharing of
products and technology, more exports, and a more efficient
business,
In Latin America, where privatization continues at a rapid pace
and trade pacts are reducing tariffs, affiliates are pooling
resources to produce more cost-competitive products. Grind of
waxy corn was eliminated in Mexico and Chile because the starch
could be produced and shipped more cheaply from Brazil, The
Colombian affiliate expanded exports into the Andean Pact
nations of Ecuador and Peru, spurring strong volume growth.
SHARING EXPERTISE
One of CPCs core strengths is itsvast global organization built
from solid local management. Another is its ability to share tech-
nology and expertise across regions and countries. ln the corn
refining business, a special unit called the Business Experience
Transfer Group evaluates processes and systems, sharing the best
and most successful of these with the rest of the corn refining
Environmental Protection: lLike the other polidies in the manual,
CPCs policy on protection of the environment is overseen by top
management and the Boards Corporate Affairs Committee and is
communicated comprehensively throughout the Company. This
policy states that CPC is committed to satisfying all applicable
legislative and regulatory requirements or even higher, self-
imposed, standards, and that CPC will prevent or correct conditions
that pose a threat to the environment.
The great majority of CPCs facilities are consumer foods pro-
cessing plants and as such present relatively few serious environ-
mental risks, Thus environmental efforts in our consumer foods
business typically focus on improvements rather than corrections
- for example reductions in packaging materials, recycling
programs and the use of recycled materials, and increased
energy efficiency.
ln corn refining the challenges are greater, Environmental
efforts at CPC's Argo, lllinois, corn refining plant illustrate our
commitment to meeting them. Compliance with new regulations,
modernization of the plant, and CPC initiatives have resulted in: a
70% reduction in air pollutant emissions since 1976; a substantial
reduction in wastewater volume generated by the plant, coupled
with a 30% reduction in biodegradable organic discharges since
1980; a reduction in the volume of packaging material; and
expansion of a plant-wide recycling program.The rebuild of a
corn oil extraction facility, to be completed in 1994, will cut odor
emissions, and atmospheric emissions of volatile organic material
from corn germ processing will be reduced by more than 40%.
cent of CPCs nearly 8,000 U.S. employees are minorities and 30%
are women, ln recent years, and in 1993 especially, CPC has pro-
moted valuing differences in our employee population through
training programs and other experiences. The Company has sev-
eral programs to further the hiring and upward mobility of
women and minorities, including four-year internship programs
for talented minority students,
Contributions: Financial and other support for our communities'
institutions and activities is an essential part of 'The CPC Way.'' In
1993, the Company made contributions valued at approximately
$20 million in cash and food products, mainly to educational insti-
tutions; health, welfare, and community service organizations; and
other cultural and charitable groups. A significant part of CPCs
contributions is donated through CPCs Matching Gifts Program in
the U.S.,which matches $2for every $l employees contribute.To
thisfinancial support are added the volunteer and Company-spon-
sored service activities of employees at many of our facilities, often
in connection with local schools and educational projects,
Commitment to the Consumer: CPC is committed to marketing
only the highest quality products at prices that truly reflect value.
We constantly strive to meet and anticipate consumers' prefer-
ences regarding health, taste, and convenience. CPC regularly
disseminates information to consumers, stressing the importance
ofthe total dietary approach to good health and physical fitness,

Lets also look at growth as a historical
matter.
hn the John Deere industrial
equipment division, he classic story
goes lke tnis: the oldest son inherited
the farm, S0 Tis younger brother
decided to go into contracting --
drainage work, land-clearing,
excavation for footings and utilities -
starting with a small doer, a backnoe,
perhaps later a four-wheel-drive
loader for site preparation work and
basement excavations; eventually,
an excavator.
This 'owner-operator' contractor
started out small, found his niche, and
buit his business on firm footings, in
relation to demand and fexible enough
to move within the available market.
Doug McMaster (at ight, n
black jacket) is just such a man. He
started out in 1981 with a John Deere
310A backnoe and built his company.
Masco, nc., into one of the largest
underground water and sewer
contracting companies in the Boise,
ldaho, area; annual contract volume
now runs about $6.5 million. The
company today owns 19 machines -
all but to are John Deere.
John Deere's industrial equipment
division has developed in parallel with
customers lke Doug McMaster. Our
product line has grown with customers'
needs, but the primaryproducts are
still the mainstays of any earthmoving
contractors fleet. This style of operation
- understanding and responding
to customers' needs - has been the
John Deere way from the beginning.
An important part of growth is
learning how to grow. We've been
learning continuously for 157 years.
We've found that the one-on-0ne
treatment that has always made
sense to farmers and contractors
also makes sense to lawn care
professionals and homeowners, o
public agencies, to 0EMs who
specify John Deere engines for thheir
own products, and to clients of our
insurance, credit, and managed health
Care SerViCes.
To position ourselves for continued
long-term growth in the awn and
grounds care equipment business, e
are doing these things:
We will continue to offer products
that meet or exceed customer expec-
tations in both quality and value.
To better focus our resources,
product offerings, and marketing and
distribution practices, we have
reorganized operations into three
strategic business units:
w Commercial equipment for
professional groundskeepets,
landscapers, and golf course and
sports turf superintendents.
aPremium lawn and garden
equlpment, Such as lawn tractors
and riding mowers.
wPower products ncluding Imowets,
trimmers, eaf blowers, egerS, and
other walk-behind and hand-held
products for both homeowners and
professional groundskeepers.
This new marketing structure
recognizes how customers eally shhop
for what they need: a homeowner who
wants a string trimmer is more likely
to go to a hardware store, ahile the
professional grounds keeper would
consider nothing ess than a serticing
John Deere dealership. Customers differ
in their expectations of the product,
and also in what they expect from
their relationship with the seller. We are
now organized to accommodate those
expectations.
Primarily in residential products, ae
are developing a much larger customer
base through the new distribution
channels we have gained by acquiring
Homelite.
Our strategy is simply to get the
right product to the ight place n order to
reach the ight customers. By this plan,
we intend to realize the sales potential of
every market we enter.
The consolidated financial statements and other financial
information of Deere &: Company in this report were prepared
by management, which is responsible for their contents. They
reflect amounts based upon managements best estimates and
informed judgments. In managements opinion, the financial
statements present fairly the financial position, results of operations
and cash fiows of the company in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.
The company maintains a system of internal accounting
controls and procedures which is intended, consistent with
reasonable cost, to provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are executed as authorized, that they are included in the financial
records in all material respects, and that accountability for assets is
maintained. The accounting controls and procedures are supported
by careful selection and training of personnel, examinations by
an internal auditing department and a continuing management
commitm:ent to the integrity of the system.
The financial statements have been audited to the extent
required by generally accepted auditing standards by Deloitte &
Touche ur, independent auditors. The independent auditors have
evaluated the companys internal control structure and performed
tests of procedures and accounting records in connection with the
issuance of their report on the fairness of the financial statements.
The Board of Directors has appointed an Audit Review
Committee composed entirely of directors who are not employees
of the company. The Audit R.eview Committee meets with
representatives of management, the internal auditing department
and the independent auditors, both separately and jointly. The
Committee discusses with the independent auditors and approves
in advance the scope of the audit, reviews with the independent
auditors the financial statements and their audit report,
consults with the internal audit staff and reviews managements
administration of the system of internal accounting controls.
The Committee reports to the Board on its activities and findings.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
of Deere & Company and subsidiaries as of October 31, 1994 and
1993 and the related statements of consolidated income and of
consolidated cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended October 31, 1994. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the companys management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and signifi-
cant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Deere & Company and subsidiaries at October 31. 1994 and 1993
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended October 31, 1994 in confor-
mity with generally accepted accounting principles.
As discussed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, effective November 1, 1992 the company changed
its method of accounting for postretirement benefits other
than pensions.

The following table sets forth the combined funded status of the companys principal plans at April 27, 1994 and April 28, 1993.
Assumptions for foreign plans are developed on a basis consistent with those for U.S. plans, adjusted for prevailing economic conditions.
In April I992, the Board of Directors amended the domestic salaried defined benefit pension plan to provide that no benefits
would accrue under this plan on or after January 1, 993. At the same time, the Board expanded, effective January 1, I993, he
defined contribution plan covering substantially all domestic salaried employees, described below. The Boards actions on the defined
benefit pension plan resulted in an after-tax curtailment gain of $23.6 million, which was recorded in 1992. No plan assets were
withdrawn from the pension plan as a result of this curtailment.
The company maintains defined contribution plans for the majority of its domestic non-union and salaried employees.
Benefits are provided through company contribution accounts which consist solely of company contributions that are a percentage of
the participants pay based on age, with the contribution rate increasing with age. In addition, certain non-union employees receive
supplemental contributions, which are paid at the discretion of the company, and matching contributions based on a percentage of the
participants contributions to the 40l(k) portion of the plan. (The companys matching contributions for salaried employees are
provided under the FS)P) The expense recognized as a result of company contributions to the defined contribution plans, excluding
the ESOP totaled $16.5 million in 1994. In 1993, $4.5 million was expensed for the company defined contribution plans.

is an important means of adding
value to the timber resource.
A vibrant housebuilding market
fuelled the demand for wood products,
sending lumber prices up early in the
year, particularly in the Southeast
where more than 85% of Cavenham's
lumber production is generated. This
strong demand created rapidly rising
domestic log prices. In addition,
continuing restrictions, influenced
by environmentalists, on Northwest
government-owned timberlands
contributed to a tight supply. Timber
prices peaked in the second quarter,
but declining demand domestically
and overseas caused prices to fall
later in the year.
Cavenham has strong cash flow and
this year generated a record E101
million after investing C18 million.
Our capital programme continues to
support sawmill efficiency and
timberland acquisitions. During the
year, small high value timberlands
were acquired, along with 44,000 acres
of formerly leased forests, Lumber
production, yield and employee
productivity improved once again.
Steady improvement in sales, earnings
and return on capital employed have
been experienced over the past
several years at DUKE CITY LUMBER and
BROWN MOULDING where both enjoyed
strong sales increases and earnings
growth of more than 20%.

The exercise prices of options outstanding at December 31,
1994 ranged from $14.63 to $54.63. These options expire if not
exercised at specific dates ranging from April 1999 to July 2003.
The price range for options exercised during the three-year period
ended December 31, 1994 was $14.63 to $14.69.
Stock participation plan. Under this plan, qualified employees may
purchase shares of Intels Common Stock at 85% of fair market
value at specific, predetermined dates. Of the 59.0 million shares
authorized to be issued under the plan, 15.4 million shares are
available for issuance at December 31. 1994. Employees purchased
2.0 million shares in 1994 (2.2 million and 2.6 million in 1993 and
1992, respectively) for $94 million ($71 million and $57 million in
1993 and 1992, respectively).
Retirement plans. The Company provides profit-sharing retirement
plans (the ''Profit-Sharing Plans'') for the benefit of qualified
employees in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. The plans are designed to
provide employees with an accumulation of funds at retirement
and provide for annual discretionary contributions to trust funds.
The Company also provides a non-qualified profit-sharing retire-
ment plan (the ''Non-Qualified Plan'') for the benefit of qualified
employees in the U.S. This plan is designed to permit certain
discretionary employer contributions in excess of the tax limits
applicable to the profit-sharing retirement plans discussed above
and to permit certain employee deferrals in excess of certain tax
limits. This plan is intended to be an unfunded plan.
The Company accrued $152 million for the Profit-Sharing Plans
and the Non-Oualified Plan in 1994 ($103 million in 1993 and
$93 million in 1992). Of the $152 million accrued in 1994, the
Company expects to fund approximately $126 million for the 1994
contribution to the Profit-Sharing Plans and to allocate approxi-
mately $5 million for the Non-Qualified Plan. The remainder, plus
approximately S120 million carried forward from prior years, is
expected to be contributed to these plans when allowable under
IRS regulations and plan rules.
Contributions made by the Company vest based on the employ-
ees years of service. Vesting begins after three years of service in
20%4 annual increments until the employee is 100% vested after
Seven years.
The Company provides qualified defined benefit pension plans
for the benefit of qualified employees in the U.S. and Puerto Rico.
Each plan provides for minimum pension benefits, which are de-
termined by a participants years of service, final average compen-
sation (taking into account the participants social security wage
base), and the value of the Companys contributions, plus earnings,
in the Profit-Sharing Plan. If the balance in the participants Profit-
Sharing Plan exceeds the pension guarantee, the participant will
receive benefits from the Profit-Sharing Plan only. Intels funding
policy is consistent with the funding requirements of federal laws
and regulations.
While our company becomes involved un new technolog1es,
new services and new areas of the world, we cannot lose sight
of the fundamental component of our drnve to exceed customer
expectations: continuous improvements in quality, service,
productivity and tiume compression. For example, to under-
score our belief that we deliver superior quality uu automotive
batteries, in 1994 we introduced a manufacturer's warranty
substantially longer than any other in the industry. Our cus-
tomers are already crediting increased growth to this feature.
On the following pages, you'll find many other examples of
the ways Johnson Controls is growing by striving to continu-
ally exceed our customers' increasing expectations.
I would lke to express my appreciation to Ettore Barbatelli,
Sr. and William L. Rootham, two members of the Board of
Drectors who retired in 1994. Ettore Barbatelli served on the
Board since 1973. Bill Rootham joined Johnson Controls un
1949, served as Vice Chairman, and helped strengthen the

Managemernrt's Discussionn and Analysis
Strategic and financial objectives
Managements primary objective is to
increase shareholder value over time. To
achieve this objective, the Company has
implemented a long-term business strategy
which focuses on continuing aggressive
investment in new cereal markets, increasing
returns on existing investments, maximizing
cash flows, and minimizing the cost of
capital through appropriate financial policies.
The success of this strategy is eflected in
the Companys superior earnings, return on
equity, total return to shareholders, and
its overall strong financial condition.
Global marketplace
Because of its strong global market share
leadership, the Company is uniquely posi-
tioned to benefit from the continued in-
crease in cereal consumption around the
world. As of December 31, 1993, our
rmarket share was 43% globally, 38% in
North America, 47% in Asia-Pacific, 50%
in Europe, and 78% in Latin America. This
favorable positioning in existing markets
is accompanied by leadership in entering
new markets with substantial long-term
potential. Kellogg opened a new cereal
plant in Latvia in 1993 and has plants sched-
uled to begin production in India in 1994
and in China in 1995. We plan to make our
products available to a billion new con-
sumers by early in the next century, more
than doubling our present reach.
Lifestyle and demographic changes in major
markets around the world favor a continued
increase in consumption of ready-to-eat ce-
real, our core product line. Two particularly
important trends are ever-increasing recogni-
tion by consumers around the world of the
nutritional value of cereal and the accelerat-
ing move of the 'baby boom'' generation
from young adulthood, where cereal con-
sumption is relatively low, to middle age,
where cereal consumption grows steadily.
The Company believes it has developed
the worldwide infrastructure and financial
resources needed to continue its leader-
ship of category growth.
Results of operations
1993 compared to 1992
Revenues
Kellogg revenues are obtained primarily from
the sale of ready-to-eat cereals in more than
150 countries. Kellogg has been marketing
cereals since 1906 and is the global market
share leader by nearly a three-to-one advan-
tage. Increased revenues are obtained by
reaching consumers in both new and devel-
oped markets with products that are both
nutritious and superior in quality. The intro-
duction of new products is vital to the
Companys long-term financial strength. For
1993, the Company introduced 24 new
products worldwide.
Despite intense competition, continued
recessions in several major markets, and unfa-
vOrable currency movements, worldwide
revenues increased by 2% for 1993, marking
the 49th consecutive annual increase. The
increase was achieved through higher selling
prices and a 2% increase in cereal volume,
being negatively impacted by foreign
currency movements. Forty percent of all
revenues are derived from outside the
United States and are subject to foreign cur-
rency fluctuations. Excluding the negative
effects of currency movements, 1993 sales
would have increased 6%. During 1993,
sales within the United States rose by 6%
from increased selling prices and volume
for both cereal and convenience foods.

parative results of operations and the financial condition
of the Corporation for the periods covered.
1902 Restrtucttu'tutz a1d ACcotutIg CDaIpes
The comparability of income statement data is affected
by the following items that occurred in 1992:
The Corporation announced a restructuring plan to
strengthen its competitive position in consumer and
service products operations in Europe and certain
operations in North America. The plan included
eliminating approximately 800 positions, principally in
Europe; restructuring manufacturing facilities at
Rouen, France, and Larkfield, England; discontinuing
diaper production at mills in Fullerton, Calif., and
Memphis, Tenn.; writing off the No. 2 newsprint
machine at the Coosa Pines, Ala., mill; and integrating
certain U.S. and Canadian consumer and service prod-
ucts operations. Additional information concerning
events and decisions which gave rise to the restructur-
ing plan is presented in Note 9 to the Financial
Statements.
The $250.0 million pretax cost of the restructuring was
charged to 1992 operating profit. The restructuring
charge decreased 1992 product class and geographic
operating profit as follows:

related products.
Class II includes newsprint, printing papers, premium
business and correspondence papers, tobacco industry
papers and products, technical papers, and related
products.
Class III includes aircraft services, commercial air
transportation and other products and services.

Properties and Depreciation Property, plant and equip-
ment, including capital leases, are carried at cost, including
interest cost capitalized during construction on significant
capital programs.
Depreciation and amortization of properties are computed
over estimated service lives generally using accelerated
methods, except for Materials and other businesses that
utilize the straight-line method. Depletion of mineral deposits
is calculated over estimated recoverable quantities by the unit-
of-production method.
Intangible Assets Costs in excess of net assets acquired are
amortized ratably over appropriate periods ranging from 20
to 40 years. Other intangibles represent amounts assigned
principally to the value of programs acquired and are
amortized over periods not exceeding l5 years,
Income Taxes Current income tax provisions represent
estimated amounts payable or recoverable for each year after
adjustments for permanent differences, Deferred income tax
provisions represent the tax effect of all significant temporary
ddifferences between financial statements and income taxes,
Research and Development and Similar Costs Research and
development and similar costs are charged to operations as
incurred unless reimbursable under specific contractual
arrangements, Independent research and development,
systems studies, other concept formulation studies and bid
and proposal work relating to government contracts represent
a ma]or portion of these expenses. Such amounts are
allocated when appropriate to government contracts through
overhead under government-mandated cost accounting
procedures,
Preoperating costs are generally charged to operations
as incurred, except that such costs for significant new
products or services and start-up costs of certain facilities
may be deferred for amortization over periods not to exceed
five years.
Earnings Per Common Share Earnings per share are
based on the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the year.
Earnings per share, assuming no dilution, were computed
in 1993 based on net earnings less the dividend requirement
of preferred stock. The weighted average number of common
shares outstanding assuming no dilution were 95,346,614 in
1993, 95,868,708 in 1992 and 99,341,210 in 1991.
Fully diluted earnings per share in 1993 asssumed that
the average number of common shares was increased by the
conversion of preferred stock from the date of issue and by
dilutive stock options. The weighted average number of
common shares outstanding, assuming full dilution, were
118,347,041 in 1993, 95,868,708 in 1992 and 99,341,210
in 1991.
On September 30, 1993, a 2for-l split of the Corporation's
common stock in the form of a 100% stock dividend became
effective. All references in the consolidated financial state-
ments with regard to the number of shares and per share data
have been restated to reflect the split.
Note B:
Business Combination with GE Aerospace
On November 22, 1992, Martin Marietta Corporation
entered into a Transaction Agreement with General Electric
Company (GE) to combine the aerospace and certain other
businesses of GE (collectively, the''GE Aerospace businesses'')
with the businesses of Martin Marietta Corporation in the
form of affiliated corporations. The transaction (the ''GE
Transaction''), was consummated on April 2, 1993, and GE
Aerospace operations have been included since that date.
The exchange consideration of approximately $3 billion
for the GE Transaction consisted of cash, preferred stock,
retention by GE of certain accounts receivable and the
assumption of payment obligations related to certain GE
indebtedness, The GE Transaction has been accounted for
under the purchase method of accounting, wherein
approximately $1.9 billion in goodwill was recognized by the
Corporation after recording approximately $700 million in
other intangibles (representing the estimated fair-market
value of certain assets) and other purchase adjustments
necessary to allocate the purchase price to the value of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is being amortized
over a 40-year period, and the other intangibles are being
amortized over a l5-year period.
The Martin Marietta securities owned by GE are held
under a Standstill Agreement. Among other things, the
Standstill Agreement provides for certain limitations on
either the increase or disposal of GE's interest in voting
securities of Martin Marietta, on GE's solicitation of proxies
and shareowner proposals, on GE's voting of its shares and on
GE's ability to place or remove members of Martin Marietta's
Board of Directors, In addition, the Standstill Agreement
requires Martin Marietta to recommend to its shareowners
the election of persons designated by GE to serve as directors
of Martin Marietta. Generally, the Standstill Agreement
provides that GE's designees will at all times constitute at least
10% of Martin Marietta's Board of Directors,
In 1986, the Board of Directors adopted a Shareholder
Rights Plan to distribute, under certain circumstances, one
Common Stock Purchase Right for each outstanding share of
the Corporation's common stock. The Rights Plan was
amended during 1990. Under the amended plan, the Rights
became exercisable if a person or group acquires, in a
transaction not approved by the Board of Directors, 15% or
more of the Corporation's common stock or announces a
tender offer for 30% or more of the stock. The GE
Transaction was approved by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation and therefore did not constitute a ''Change of
Control'' for purposes of the shareholder rights plan. The
new Martin Marietta Corporation has not adopted a
shareholder rights plan.
The following unaudited pro forma information presents
the results of operations of the Corporation and the GE
Aerospace businesses for the vears ended December 31, 1993
and 1992, with pro forma adjustments as if the GE
Transaction had been consummated as of the beginning of
the periods presented. This pro forma information does not
purport to be indicative of what would have occurred had the
acquisition been made as of those dates or of results which
may occur in the future.

LEADING-EDGE ADVACEMEMTS
In conjunction with environmental con-
siderations, our businesses and our cus-
tomers were challenged by the overall
sluggishness of the chemical industry.
This made cost economies and leading-
edge performance advancements critical
for retaining or gaining market share.
Responding to cost efficiency demands
in the automotive industry, we introduced a
low-density filler for our Bayflex reaction in-
jection molding (RIN) polyurethane systems.
This filler helps automakers reduce the costs
for bumper fascias.
Also in the automotive market, the
blocked polyisocyanates of the coatings
business were the formulation bases for
new one-component polyurethane clear-
coats, Offering properties comparable to
two-component polyurethane clearcoats,
these coatings can be applied using one-
component equipment. As a result, auto-
makers no longer need major equipment
investments to obtain the performance ben-
efits of polyurethane clearcoat technology.
Our Palomar blue pigment was a suc-
cessful new product, fueled by the popu-
larity of vibrant blue-green car finishes.
And ( uindo violet pigment will help our
organic pigments business maintain its
worldwide leadership role in supplying
pigments that meet - and anticipate - the
latest styling trends in automotive coat-
ings. This business also was strengthened
in 1993 with the dedication of a new
organic pigments manufacturing plant
and pilot production facility at our Bushy
Park, S.C., site.
In direct response to long-standing

rubber chemicals business gained market
share, with antidegradant and accelerator
products among the top performers.
Facilitating the fully automatic and
waste-free manufacture of intricate rubber
parts, our Bavsilone liquid silicone rubber
attained an outstanding growth rate in

To speed patient diagnosis in busy
hospitals and health care centers, we intro-
duced the Matri LR 3300 laser imager,
which processes more than 300 films per
hour. Another efficiency enhancer is our
new Scopi LT-IR infrared laser film,
which provides excellent results for many
diagnostic methods, including magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound.
Less time is spent retrieving and loading
different kinds of films for different tech-
niques, a valuable savings for patients
and physicians.
In another milestone for the technical
imaging industry, we developed the
For photo dealers and lab operators,
we expanded our successful Partner Pro-

honors such as Woolworth's 1993 Vendor
Excellence Award and the International
Award for Outstanding Performance from
the American Society of Photofinishers.
Our vision for graphic systems was to

ERVIRONMENTAL EFFORTS
At Agfa, we place a major emphasis on
environmental responsibility. Representa-
tive of these efforts is our photo imaging
system's EARTH program (Environmental
Assistance and Response That Helps).
EARTH helps customers reduce plastic bot-
tle and liquid waste during processing. In
our graphic systems business, we developed
a comprehensive manual that helps prepress
customers learn how to apply current
knowledge in the waste reduction field to
their own business practices.
To better serve our customers in North
America, we opened a plant at our Bushy
IMPAX image management and archiving
system, used to electronically send medi-
cal images from location to location for
instant diagnosis and archiving.
We also did well in our motion picture
film business. Agfa's CP-10 film, on which
'The Fugitive,'''Free Willy''''Sommersby''
and other movies in 1993 were printed,
gained immediate acceptance for its sharp-
ness and dye stability, and the reduced envi-
ronmental impact of its processing. CP.10
is a polyester-based film with no conven-
tional carbon black backing, resulting in a
significant reduction in water consumption.
CUSTOMER SERVICE A TOP PRIORITY
In addition to emphasizing technological
advancement. Agfa put forth unprecedented
efforts in 1993 to solidify customer service
as a top priority.

became a reality.
We also developed a stronger dealer
partnership by supporting our dealers with
enhanced technical, training and consult-
ing programs, including the Agfa Center
for Education, or ACE, a facility in Teter-
boro, N.J., for instruction and training on
all Agfa electronic and photographic pre-
press systems.
Driven in part by major restructuring
in the way national and regional hospital
associations are run, customer service
requirements rapidly changed in the med-
ical imaging field. In response, we in-
creased our marketing efforts toward large
hospital and health care systems, regional-
ized our field sales and service staffs and
instituted other changes to optimize cus-
tomer support.

packages color photographic paper and
soon will add X-ray and graphic arts films
to its repertoire. We have made protecting
the environment a focus at this new plant.
In addition to using recycled packaging
for our color photo paper, we introduced a
recycling program that reduces the amount
of waste associated with the fiber cores
inside rolls of photo paper. Our plant was
the first of its kind to initiate such exten-
sive environmental efforts for photo-
graphic paper.
From packaging innovation, to the

But the rewards can also be sweet.
The Chemical Group, as now aligned, has demon-
strated its increasing earnings capability even without
much help from the worldwide economies. This is a very
strong unit. Only one or two businesses need further work
to make them full players, and we are going about that
work now. The Chemical Group will be solid and teliable.
NutraSweet, which was part of the G.D. Searle S Co.
acquisition in 1985, has generated enough cash to pay for
the entire Searle acquisition and subsequent investments,
including the cost of capital. This assumes typical values
for the current assets, In addition, NutraSweets prospects
have been successfully stabilized following the 1992 espi-
ration of its U.S. patent for NutraSweet brand sweetener.
It is now time for Searle, our pharmaceutical unit, to
begin to pay its own way and secure its own future. We
have carefully studied Searles current and emerging
product line. We have concluded that Searle is sustainable
as a medium-size pharmaceutical company meeting cor-
porate targets, despite the realities of health care cost
containment. Our original intention when we acquired
Searle, however, was tor much more. Our job now is to
determine whether we can form alliances and related
actions with other pharmaceutical companies that would
result in cost savings, product gains, and a larger phar-
maceutical presence. Such alliances will be a significant
determinant in our tuture plans for Searle, An intense
effort is under way to find the right partners,

ACCOUNTING CHANGES Occidental changed
its method of accounting for postretirement benefits
other than pensions by adopting SFAS No. 106-
''Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions,'' effective January 1, 1992. This
statement substantially changed the existing method
of accounting for postretirement benefits by requiring
that the cost of these benefits, which are primarily
health care related, be recognized in the financial
statements during the employees' active working
careers, rather than the previously permitted practice
of accounting for such costs as claims were paid. The
adoption of SFAS No. 106 resulted in an after-tax
charge against 1992 earnings of $529 million, includ-
ing $513 million which was charged to the 1992 first
quarter earnings for the cumulative effect of this
accounting change and a charge of $16 million for
the ongoing effect included in 1992 earnings.
Occidental also adopted, effective [anuary 1, 1992,
SFAS No. 109-''Accounting for Income Taxes,'' which
requires an asset and liability approach in accounting
for income taxes, Under this method, deferred
income taxes are recognized, at enacted rates, to
reflect the future effects of tax carryforwards and tem-
porary differences arising between the tax bases of
assets and liabilities and their financial reporting
amounts at each year-end. SFAS No. 109 required the
restatement of assets and liabilities related to pur-
chased businesses to eliminate the previously used
net-of-tax accounting for such assets and liabilities,
resulting in higher carrying values and therefore in
higher operating charges for depreciation, depletion
and amortization but lower tax expense. This state-
ment also eliminated the concept of the utilization of
net operating loss carryforwards for accounting pur-
poses, which were previously reported as extraordi-
nary items, by requiring the immediate recognition of
losses in the year incurred, subject to realization. The
adoption of SFAS No. 109 resulted in a net benefit to
1992 earnings of $285 million, including a $420 mil-
lion benefit to 1992 first quarter earnings for the
cumulative effect of this accounting change and a
charge of $135 million attributable to and included in
1992 earnings.
The special items included in the 1993, 1992 and
1991 results are detailed below. For further informa-
tion see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial State-
ments and the discussion above.
(a) These amounts are shown after-tax.
Occidental's estimated operating expenses in 1993
relating to compliance with environmental laws and
regulations governing ongoing operations were
approximately $110 million, compared with $117 mil-
lion in 1992 and $135 million in 1991. The 1993
amount included $71 million in the chemical division,
$34 million in the oil and gas division and $5 million
in the natural gas transmission division. In addition,
estimated capital expenditures for environmental com-
pliance were $83 million in 1993, compared with $80
million in both 1992 and 1991. The 1993 amount
included $47 million in the oil and gas division, $32
million in the chemical division and $4 million in the
natural gas transmission division. Divisional operating
and capital expenditures for environmental compli-
ance are expected to increase in the future.
FOREIGN INVESTMENTS Portions of Occiden-
tal's oil and gas assets are located in countries outside
North America, some of which may be considered
politically and economically unstable. These assets
and the related operations are subject to the risk of
actions by governmental authorities and insurgent
groups, Occidental attempts to conduct its financial
affairs so as to protect against such risks and would
eXpect to receive compensation in the event of
nationalization. At December 31, 1993, the carrying
value of Occidental's oil and gas assets in countries
outside North America aggregated approximately
$1.38 billion, or approximately 8 percent of Occiden-
tal's total assets at that date. Of such assets, approxi-
mately $530 million was located in Latin America,
and substantially all of the remainder were located in
the Middle East, West Africa, Russia and Pakistan.
1994 BUSINESS OUTLOOK Economic growth
has been rather sluggish in recent years, During 1994,
the rate of growth is expected to increase moderately
in the United States and Japan and is expected to
improve in other industrial Organization for Eco-
nomic Cooperation and Development countries,
particularly if energy prices remain weak. The combi-
nation of continued economic growth and low energy
prices should in turn boost consumption. The new
GATT and NAFTA trade agreements also are expected
to give a boost to the worldwide economy, On a
global scale, health, environmental and safety issues
are expected to continue to grow in importance.
Oil & Natural Gas Industry The interplay
between global politics, world oil supply and demand
and the pace of economic growth worldwide will
remain the key factors in determining future crude oil
prices, Crude oil production capacity will continue to
grow in 1994, Several major OPEC producing coun-
tries, particularly Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, are contin-
uing to boost production capacity. The anticipated
lifting of the embargo on exports from Iraq was one
of the factors that contributed to the oil price collapse
in late 1993 and is expected to continue to influence
oil prices. The additional capacity, which includes
non-OPEC production from areas like Yemen and the
British North Sea, is continuing to exert downward
pressure on prices. The extent of that pressure in the
future depends in part upon the ability of OPEC to
maintain production discipline as capacity grows,
These factors could well be counterbalanced by
declines in Russian crude oil exports due to produc-
tion problems and the prospect that the resumption
of Iraqi exports could be delayed indefinitely, It is
within this geopolitical framework that the NYMEX
futures market has emerged as a powerful influence
on price as traders react instantaneously based upon
their perceptions of changing market fundamentals
and news about global political events.
The sector of the oil and gas industry that has
attracted the most attention recently and reflects the
most optimistic projections is natural gas, Prices of
natural gas in the United States have moved up
rapidly and consumption increased in 1993 to over 20
Tcf, the highest level since 1979. The outlook for con-
tinued increases in natural gas demand remains
highly positive because it is a clean burning, relatively
abundant fuel, making it very attractive in this ''age
of environment.'' It has long been used for residential
heating and burned under industrial and utility boil-
ers, Now a concerted effort is being made to adapt it
as a transport fuel.
The United States has large potential reserves of
natural gas, but drilling activity has been severely
depressed in recent years, Consequently, proved nat-
ural gas reserves and productive capacity have
declined. With higher prices, companies are resuming
exploration in natural gas-prone areas, and drilling
activity has started to increase.
In recent years, structural problems, such as
government price controls, production and con-
sumption regulations and cumbersome contract
problems, impeded the gas industry's ability to
respond to rapidly changing competitive conditions
and price changes.
However, the industry recently has made changes
to resolve these problems. Supply contract problems
are being resolved. The industry is aggressively pursu-
ing its existing markets and expanding into new ones,
Government regulations are being reduced and/or
eliminated. And of prime importance, natural gas
prlcing has become much more flexible and respon-
sive to market changes.
The anticipated increase in economic activity in
1994 will in turn translate into an increased need for
energy, including natural gas. In addition to increased
demand for natural gas associated with growing eco-
nomic activity and much colder than normal winter
weather in early 1994, demand also is expected to
grow due to environmental regulations associated
At December 31, 1993, $987 million of commercial paper and other notes due in 1994 were classified as non-
current since it is management's intention to refinance this amount on a long-term basis, utilizing proceeds from
the sale of $3.00 cumulative CXY-indexed convertible preferred stock (see Note 17) and an available line of bank
credit with a maturity extending beyond 1994.
At December 31, 1993, minimum principal payments on senior funded debt, including sinking fund require-
ments, subsequent to December 31, 1994 aggregated $5.896 billion, of which $198 million is due in 1995, $18
million in 1996, $753 million in 1997, $635 million in 1998, $633 million in 1999 and $3.659 billion thereafter.
Included in the 1997 amount of $753 million is approximately $430 million that Occidental intends to initially
refinance under its bank line of credit that expires in 1997, but with agreement of the parties, may be extended
for a further two years, Unamortized discount is generally being amortized to interest expense on the effective
interest method over the lives of the related issues.
At December 31, 1993, under the most restrictive covenants of certain financing agreements, the capacity for
the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on, and for acquisitions of, Occidental's capital stock was
approximately $1.3 billion, assuming that such dividends, distributions and acquisitions were made without
incurring additional borrowings.
At December 31, 1993, Occidental had available lines of committed bank credit of approximately $1.9 billion,
net of $689 million representing amounts utilized to support commercial paper borrowings, Bank fees on commit-
ted lines of credit ranged from 0.125 percent to 0.25 percent.
Occidental has authorized 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $1.00 per share. In February
1993, Occidental issued 11,500,000 shares of $3.875 cumulative convertible preferred stock. The $3.875 preferred
stock is redeemable after February 1998, in whole or in part, at the option of Occidental, at redemption prices
declining to $50 per share in and after the year 2003. The $3.875 preferred stock has a liquidation value of $50 per
share plus accumulated unpaid dividends and is convertible at the option of the holder into common stock of
Occidental at a conversion price of $22.76 per share, subject to adjustment in certain events. Dividends on the
$3.875 preferred stock at an annual rate of $3.875 per share are cumulative and are payable quarterly in arrears,
when and as declared by Occidental's Board of Directors. Holders of the $3.875 preferred stock have no voting
rights, except in certain circumstances; however, they are entitled to elect additional directors if the equivalent of
six quarterly dividends on the $3.875 preferred stock are accumulated and unpaid.
In 1992, Occidental redeemed all of its outstanding $12.00 cumulative preferred stock. Occidental had
400,000 shares of $12.00 cumulative preferred stock outstanding throughout 1991 and up until redemption in
September 1992, with a carrying value of $40 million.
In 1986, pursuant to a stockholders' rights plan, a dividend of one stock purchase right (right) on each out-
standing share of Occidental's common stock was issued. Similar rights have been, and generally will be, issued in
respect of shares of common stock subsequently issued. Each right becomes exercisable, upon the occurrence of
certain events, for one one-hundredth of a share of Series A junior participating preferred stock, par value $1 per
share, at a purchase price of $80 or, under certain circumstances, common stock or other securities, cash or other
assets having a then current market price (as defined and subject to adjustment) equal to twice such purchase
price. The rights currently are not exercisable and will be exercisable only if a person or group either acquires ben-
eficial ownership of 20 percent or more of Occidental's common stock or commences a tender or exchange offer
that would result in ownership of 30 percent or more. The rights, which expire in October 1996, are redeemable
in whole, but not in part, at Occidental's option at any time for a price of $.05 per right.
Pfizer's Animal Health Group is moving toward
what promises to be the most significant period
of growth in its history. The group is in the early
stages of introducing three major new products-
Dectomax, Advocin and Aviax-around the world
These innovative products add significant thera-
peutic value to the practice of animal husbandry.
They, along with the technical assistance needed
to use them for best results, will be important addi-
tions to the line of products which the Animal
Health Group markets to the large producers of
food animals.
Operationally, 1993 was an exciting year. We
launched Dectomax in its first markets, Advocin
sales continued to expand, and sales of in-line
products maintained excellent levels. We also
began a number of restructuring projects which
we expect will contribute significantly to our
future profitability. A major element of our restruc-
turing was the formation of the North American
Animal Health Division, a fully integrated opera-
tion serving the U.S. and Canada. By moving the
headquarters of this new division to Lees Summit,
Missouri--within 1,000 miles of all our major cus-
tomers--we have made it possible for our senior
management to work more closely with the largest
food producers, while at the same time reducing
costs and improving efficiency.
Beginning in 1994, the Animal Health Group
expects to realize significant growth in both sales
and profit. New products should account for at
least 40 percent of worldwide sales bv 1998. In
addition, new drug candidates already in our dis-
covery research facilities hold the promise of a
substantial pipeline of new products well into the
next century.
doing on the product. The early success of
Dectomax in Brazil, the world's second-largest cat-
tle market, is a significant indicator of its potential.
Sales of Advocin, our fluoroquinolone antibac-
terial for livestock, increased significantly in 1993
largely on the strength of its successful introduc-
tion in Japan. The product is now available
throughout most of Latin America, Africa and
Asia. By late 1995, we expect to begin rolling it out
in the large markets of Europe and the tU.S., where
respiratory disease is a major problem.
Aviax, a Pfizer-discovered product for the treat-
ment of coccidiosis in chickens, should be intro-
duced shortly. It has already been approved in
most of Latin America. Aviax will complement
Coxistac, a licensed anticoccidial which we mar-
ket outside the U.S. and Europe. Since poultry
producers generally rotate their flocks between
three or four anticoccidials, it will enhance our
sales opportunities where we market Coxistac and
will open up a whole new business for Pfizer in
those countries where we do not.
In addition to introducing innovative new prod-
ucts developed by our researchers, the Animal
Health Group is working hard to improve the prof-
itability of its existing world markets and products,
Our flagship in-line product, TM/LA, continued to
show excellent growth-particularly in the West-
ern Hemisphere, where sales increased by 29 per-
cent. Sales of our anthelmintic family of products
rose by 13 percent, and Coxistac sales increased by
9 percent. The 9 percent decline in operating profit
reflects the initial manufacturing start-up expenses
for several new products as well as heavy expendi-
tures to support new product introductions.
pending in the Superior Court, Orange County.
California. More than 100 of these were settled in early
1993. Trial of the first of the remaining cases, of six
selected for trial, began July 29, 1993 After trial, but
before verdict, most of the remaining cases as well as
several unfiled claims, involving approximately 250
implantees, were settled.
In an attempt to resolve all claims alleging anxiety that
properly functioning valves might fracture in the future,
the Company entered into a settlement agreement in
January 1992 in Bowling v Shiley et al., a case brought in
the United States District Court for the Southern District
of Ohio that establishes a worldwide settlement class
of people with CIC heart valves and their spouses, except
those who elect to exclude themselves, The settlement
provides for a Consultation Fund of $90 to $140 million
(depending on the number of claims filed) from which
valve recipients who make claims will receive payments
that are intended to cover their cost of consultation with
cardiologists or other health care providers with respect
to their valves, The settlement agreement establishes a
second fund of at least $75 million to support CIC valve-
related research, including the development of tech-
niques to identify valve recipients who may have
significant risk of fracture, and to cover the unreim-
bursed medical expenses that valve recipients may incur
for certain procedures related to the valves. The
Company's obligation as to coverage of these unreim-
bursed medical expenses is not subject to any dollar
limitation. Following a hearing on the fairness of the
settlement, it was approved by the court on August 19,
1992. An appeal of the courts approval of the settlement
was dismissed on December 20, 1993 by the United
States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. A motion
for rehearing en banc is currently pending. It is expected
that most of the costs arising from the Bowling class set-
tlement will be covered by insurance and the proceeds
of the sale of certain product lines of the Shiley busi-
nesses in 1992.
Of approximately 900 implantees (and spouses of some
of them) who opted out of the Bowling settlement class,
12 currently have cases or claims pending in the Kahn
consolidation in California; 4 have cases or claims pend-
ing outside of California; approximately 675 whose claims
were included in the Kahn consolidation have been set-
tled; approximately 100 have never filed a case or claim;
and approximately 10 have working valve cases pending.
Several claims relating to elective reoperations of valve
recipients are currently pending. Some of these claims
relate to elective reoperations covered by the Bowling
class settlement described above, and, therefore, the
claimants are entitled to certain benefits in accordance
with the settlement. Such claimants, if they irrevocably
waive all of the benefits of the settlement, may pursue
separate litigation to recover damages in spite of the class
settlement. The Company is defending these claims.
Generally, the plaintiffs in all of the pending heart
valve litigations discussed above seek money damages.
Based on the experience of the Company in defending
these claims to date, including available insurance and
reserves, the Company is of the opinion that these actions
should not have a material adverse effect on the financial
position or the results of operations of the Company
On September 30, 1993, Dairyland Insurance Co.,
a carrier providing excess liability coverage ''excess car-
rier'') in the early 1980s, commenced an action in the
California Superior Court in Orange County. seeking
a declaratory judgment that it was not obligated to pro-
vide insurance coverage for Shiley heart valve liability
claims. On October 8, 1993, Pfizer filed cross-complaints
against Dairyland and filed third-party complaints
against 73 other excess carriers who sold excess liability
policies covering periods from 1978 to 1985, seeking
damages and declaratory judgments that they are oblig-
ated to pay for defense and indemnity to the extent not
paid by other carriers.
The Company's operations are subject to federal, state
and local environmental laws and regulations. Under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation
and Liability Act of 1980, as amended ('CERCLA''
or ''Superfund''), the Company has been designated as
a potentially responsible party by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency with respect to certain
waste sites with which the Company may have had direct
or indirect involvement. Similar designations have been
made by some state environmental agencies under
applicable state superfund laws. Such designations are
made regardless of the extent of the Company's involve-
ment. There are also claims that the Company is a
potentially responsible party or participant with respect
to several waste sites in Canada, Such claims have been
made by the filing of a complaint, the issuance of an
administrative directive or order, or the issuance of a
notice or demand letter. These claims are in various
stages of administrative or judicial proceedings. They
include demands for recovery of past governmental costs
and for future investigative or remedial actions, In many
cases, the dollar amount of the claim is not specified,
In most cases, claims have been asserted against a num-
ber of other entities for the same recovery or other relief
as was asserted against the Company. The Company is
currently participating in remedial action at a number
of sites under federal, state and local laws.
Ttb the extent possible with the limited amount of
information available at this time, the Company has evalu-
ated its responsibility for costs and related liability with
respect to the above sites and is of the opinion that the
Companys liability with respect to these sites should not
have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or
the results of operations of the Company In arriving at this
conclusion, the Company has considered, among other
things, the payments that have been made with respect to
the sites in the past; the factors, such as volume and rela-
tive toxicity, ordinarily applied to allocate defense and
remedial costs at such sites; the probable costs to be paid
by the other potentially responsible parties; total projected

For the year, RPG Group's pro forma
sales and net earninqs before restructur-
ing charges were $5,236,200,000 and
$266,400.000, respectively, compared
to $5,024,300.000 and 1277,300,000
in 1993. Pro forma earnings per share for
the year were $2.48 and $2.37 on a pri-
rmary and fully diluted basis, respectively,
compared to $2.50 and $2.38. The
decrease in pro forma results was driven
by a $.25 per primary share decrease
in earnings related to the RPG Group's
retained interest in the CBG Group,
partially offset by higher operating
earnings.
Operating profit for domestic pet foods
was flat as hiqher volumes were offset by
higher ingredient costs. Operating profit
for international pet foods improved on
higher volumes.
Battery Products' operating profit, exclu-
sive of restructuring charges, increased
for the year on significantly higher
domestic results and inclusion of
rechargeable operations acquired in
August 1993, partially offset by contin-
ued declines in Europe. Domestic
increases were driven by improved alka-
line volume. European operations
declined on an unfavorable product
mix, significant declines in carbon zinc
volume and increased costs associated
with launching of the Energizer brand to
supplant existing alkaline brands.
Unadjusted operating profit for Battery
Products was down due to charges
related to restructurinq of the worldwide
carbon zinc operations.
Operating profit for the Protein business
improved on increased volumes partially
offset by higher raw materials costs and
unfavorable foreiqn currency exchange

profit was down sliqhtly due to volume
declines in Europe, partially offset by
improvements in Asia and the Americas.

TThe company's products are reported in four industry segments
as follows:
Pharmaceutical Products-ncludes prescription medcines,
mainly cardovascular, anti-infective and anti-cancer drugs,
which comprse about 40%, 25% and 20%, respectively, of the
segments sales, central nervous system drugs and other pharma-
ceutical products.
Medical Devices-includes orthopaedc m1plants, which comprise
about 40% of the segments sales, ostomy and wound care products,
surgcal nstruments and other medical devices.
Nonprescription Health Products-includes infant hormulas and
other nutritional products, which comprse about 65% of the seg-
ments sales, analgescs, cough/cold remedes and skn care products.
Toiletries and Beauty Aids-ncludes haircoloring and har care
preparations, which comprise about 75% of the segments sales in
1994 and 65% in both 1993 and 1992, and deodorants, anti-per-
sprants and other toiletries and beauty aids.
UUnallocated expenses principally consst of general admmistrative
expenses and net interest income, and mn 1992 include a portion
of the charge for restructuring. Other assets are principally cash
and cash equrvalents, time deposits and marketable securities.
Inter-area sales by geographic area for the years ended December
3 1, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectrvely, werei UImted States-
S867 rmillion, $859 rmllion and $915 mllion, Europe, Mid-East
and Africa--$428 million, $504 million and $382 mdlion, Other
Western Hemsphere---$37 million, $41 million and $36 millon,
and Pacific--$28 millon, $43 million and $26 million. These
sales are usually blled at or above manufacturing costs.
Net assets relating to operations outside the Ulnited States
amounted to $2,286 mllon, $1,511 mllion and $1,369 million
at December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
Our government avionics business
won an initial $11 million U.S Army
contract for ARC-220 high frequency
radios with production options that
would expand total contract value
to $150 mllion. The ARC-2204 will
go into approximately 3,000 Army
helicopters.
Production orders totaling $47
million for approximately 27,000

Gulftream IV/V aircraft, and a $l6 mil-
[ lion contract to upgrade avionics on
Canadian C -130 aircraft.
Our Telecommunications business had
record sales and earnings in fiscal 1994,
a performance driven by continued
strong demand for high-speed data
modems. This busness supplies
facsimile and data modems and other
advanced semiconductor devices to
process, transmt and receive all types
of information. We provide approxi-
mately 80 percent of all facsimile
modems and 60 percent of personal
computer data modems worldwide.
The year was highlighted by
major investments in expansion of
faciltes and new product introduction.
An $150 million expanson of our
Newport Beach, California faclity,

1. Financial Statement Presentation
Significant accounting policies are set forth in italcs as an
integral part of the notes to financial statements to which
the policies relate. Certain prior year amounts have been
reclassified to conform with current year presentation.
In 1992, the company adopted Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement No. 106, 'Employers Accounting
for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions,' resulting
in a one-time charge to earnings of $1,519 million, or $6.78
per share, after a deferred tax benefit of $931 million, The
company also adopted Statement No. 109, ''Accounting for
Income Taxes,' which did not have a material effect on 1992
income before change in accounting.
2. Acquisition of Reliance Electric Company
On November 21, 1994, the company announced it had
entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all shares of
common stock of Reliance Electric Company (Reliance), a
major manufacturer of industrial products and telecommuni-
cations equipment with annual sales of $1.7 billion, at a
price of $31 per share of Class A and Class B common stock
and an equivalent price ($83.95) for Class C common stock.
The offer has a total transaction value of approximately $1.6
billion and is expected to be completed in early 1995 The
company will finance this acquisition utilizing its credit
agreements (see Note 8). The company has announced its
intention to divest Reliances telecommunications business
which has annual sales of approximately $440 million.
3. Receivables
Receivables are summarized as follows (in millions):
Inventores are stated at the lower of cost (using LIFO, FIFO or
average metbods] or market (determined on the bass of estmated
realizable values). less related progress payments received. Pursuant
to contract provisions the Ulnited States U.overnment has
title to, or a security interest in, certain inventories as a
result of progress payments.
Long-term contracts in process consist of inventoried
costs principally relating to fixed-price-type contracts with
the UUnited States Government. Such inventonied costs include
direct costs of manufacturing, engmeering and tooling, and allocable
overbead costs includmg general and admimstrative exfenses allowable
m accordance unth Ulnited States Government contract cost prmcitles
In accordance with industry ppractice, such mmventoed costs mclude
amounts which are not exppected to be realzed uithn one year
10. Properties, Plants and Equipment
11, Short-Term Borrowings and Lines of Credit
The Company had $500 million of credit facilities as of
December 31, 1993 in the form of revolving credit agree-
ments from commercial banks which provide for revolv-
ing credit through August 1996. These facilities support
Sun's commercial paper borrowings, All of the above
facilities are subject to commitment fees, the amounts of
which are not material, As of December 31, 1993, there
were no borrowings against these revolving credit agree-
ments. The Company also has access to short-term financ-
ing under non-committed money market facilities, At
December 31, 1993, $60 million was borrowed through
these facilities,
At December 31, 1993, Suncor had a revolving term
credit facility available for its own use aggregating ap-
proximately $302 million, Committed revolving credit
will be available through October 1998. The facility pro-
vides for commitment fees, the amounts of which are not
material, At December 31, 1993, $91 million was bor-
rowed against this facility which was classified as long-
term debt as it is Suncor's intention to refinance that
amount on a long-term basis (Note 12).

While settlement of the terminated portions of the
FSD contract has not been finalized with the U.S. Gov-
ernment, Textron believes that its share of cumulative
losses on the FSD contract is not likely to exceed the
amounts previously recorded.
1992 ys. 1991
The Aircraft segment's revenues and income increased in
1992 by $265.3 million (21%) and $15.3 million
(14%), respectively, due to the inclusion of the operat-
ing results of Cessnas manufacturing operations for 10
months in 1992, partially offset by lower revenues and
income at Bell Helicopter.
Bell Helicopter's revenues decreased significantly in
its non-U.S. Government business due to market soft-
ness and decreased to a lesser degree in its U.S. Govern-
ment business. Bell's income decreased primarily as a
result of the lower revenues, the effect in 1991 of a
favorable LIFO inventory reserve adjustment (resulting
from a reduction in LIFO inventories) and the effect of
the new accounting method relative to postretirement
benefits other than pensions, parcially offset by the ben-
efit of a lower provision in 1992 ($10 million vs. $45
million in 1991) for cost increases on the V-22 FSD
contract and other loss provisions in 1991.
Automotive
1993 vs, 1992
The Automotive segment's revenues increased $589.1
million (50%) in 1995 primarily as a result of the inclu-
sion of the operating results of Textron Acustar Plastics
for eight months, higher automotive production and a
broader market penetration of automotive interior prod-
ucts, Income increased $22. 1 million (54%), due to the
higher revenues, partially offset by a special warranty
provision and provisions for restructuring costs of $7
million.
1992 vs. 1991
The Automotive segments revenues increased $110.5
million (16%) over the 1991 level primarily as a result
of broader market penetration of automotive interior
products, Income increased $15.6 million (5 1%), due to
the higher revenues, partially offset by higher starc-up
costs on new programs and plants.

The consolidated financial statements of Textron Inc.
have been prepared by management and have been
audited by Textron's independent auditors, Ernst &
Young, whose report appears below. Management is
responsible for the consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles and include amounts
based on managements judgments,
Management is also responsible for maintaining
internal accounting control systems designed to provide
reasonable assurance, at appropriate cost, that assets are
sateguarded and thar transactions are executed and
recorded in accordance with established policies and
procedures. Textron's systems are under continuing
review and are supported by, among other things, busi-
ness conduct and other written guidelines, an internal
audit function and the selection and training of qualified
personnel.
SSSSSSa
We have audited the accompanying consolidated bal-
ance sheet of Textron Inc. as of January 1, 1994 and
January 2, 1995, and the related consolidated state-
ments of income, cash flows and changes in shareholders'
equity for each of the three years in the period ended
January 1, 1994. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with gener-
ally accepted auditing standards. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial state-
ments are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting princi-
ples used and signiticant estimates made by manage-
ment, as well as evaluating the overall financial state-
ment presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the consoli-
dated financial position of Textron Inc. at January 1,
1994 and January 2, 1995 and the consolidated results
of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended January 1, 1994 in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.
As discussed in Notes 15 and 14 to the consolidated
financial statements, in fiscal 1992 the Company
changed its methods of accounting for postretirement
benefits other than pensions and income taxes.
(A) 1993 and 1992 amounts include cumulative effect of accounting changes.

growing number of our software solutions, these
systems are based on flexible client/server archi-
tectures designed for easy integration with other
vendors' systems.
To ensure we deliver truly value-added solu-
tions, we involve our clients throughout the devel-
opment process. We built FBA Navigator and FBA
BANKview, for instance, in consultation with key
banking partners. LifelLine reflects the input of
police chiefs and dispatchers.
Alliances with outside industry partners are
also key to our approach. Through our alliance
with KPMG Peat Marwick, for instance, we offer
our clients a broad base of industry expertise as
well as specific software solutions for financial
Ianagement, human resources, and process man-
afacturing. An alliance with software provider
Information Technology, Inc., which provides a leading banking package running on our A Series systems, has
helped us win new banking, savings and loan, and credit union clients.
In our services engagements, and in our solutions, we are making itncreasing use of the skills and underlying
technologies of our Government Systems Group. Joint government and commercial teams are evaluating commer-
cial projects in such potential growth areas as airport automation and fingerprint imaging. In another area, we are
working with Time Warner to evaluate applying our spread spectrum technology - originally used to ensure the
secure communication of information for military purposes - to improve the security and capability of tomorrow's
cable television networks.
In 1994 we will continue an active expansion of our information services program. We look to build our repu-
tation as a world-class provider of information services, and continue our strong growth in this dynamic market.
Department of National Defence. Any future declines in defense industry spending could affect the
COmpanys ability to obtain new defense contracts, and no assurance can be given that current, in-
process, multiple-year contracts will not be downsized or discontinued.
Total gross profit margin increased to 3 in 1993 from 36 in 1992. Sales gross profit margin in 193
was 41%compared to 38 in 1992; services gross profit margin for 1993 was 23 compared to 21% in 1992;
and equipment maintenance gross profit margin for 1993 was 43% compared to 42 in 1992. Excluding
restructuring charges, in 1991 the total gross profit margin was 32, sales gross profit margin was 33k,
services gross profit margin was 1T, and equipment maintenance gross profit margin was 40%. Prior
years' services gross profit margin reflects a reclassification of certain selling, general and administrative
expenses to cost of services to conform with the 1993 presentation of such costs. This reclassification was
made to better match service costs with service revenue and produced no change to operating profit.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for 1993 was $1.6 billion, a decrease of 7% from $1.8 billion in 1992. The decline
was principally due to the effects of continued tight cost management and foreign currency translation. Selling, general and
administrative expenses for 1992 were $1.8 billion compared to $2.3 billion in 1991. Exclusive of restructuring charges in 1991,
selling, general and administrative expenses declined 10%, The decline was principally due to the Companys repositioning
actions. Total employment at December 31, 1993 was approximately 49,000 compared to approximately 54,300 at December 31,
1992 and 60,300 at December 31, 1991.
Research and development expenses in 1993 were $515.2 million compared to $535.9 million in 1992, a decline of 4%.
Sesearch and development expenses in 1992 were $535.9 million compared to $638.9 million in 1991. Exclusive of special charges
n 1991, research and development expenses declined 9k in 1992 from 1991. The decline in all periods resulted from repositioning
ctions which reduced managerial and administrative costs and focused research and development efforts on core products.
As a result of the above, operating income was $734.1 million in 1993 (9.5%4 of revenue) com-
pared to $720.7 million in 1992 (8.6 of revenue) and an operating loss of $678.9 million in 1991
($245.3 million operating income exclusive of special charges, 2.8% of revenue).
Interest expense was $241.7 million in 1993, down from $340.6 million in 1992, reflecting prin-
cipally lower average debt levels. nterest expense in 1992 was down from $407.6 million in 1991,
reflecting both lower average debt levels and lower average interest rates.
Other income in 1993 was $11.0 million compared to $55.5 million in 1992 and an expense of
$301.8 million in 1991. Excluding special charges of $ß75.4 million, 1991 other income was $73.6
million. Included in 1993 is a charge of $20.0 million related to the 'Ill Wind'' settlement. This set-
lement requires the Company to make contingency payments based on proceeds from asset sales
and on net income. The maximum contingent amount payable in 1994 under this settlement agree-
ment is $ß0.0 million.

1. Summary of significant accounting policies
Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all
wholly owned subsidiaries. Investments in companies representing
ownership interests of 20% to 50% are accounted for by the equity
method.
Cash equivalents
All short-term investments purchased with a maturity of three
months or less are classified as cash equivalents.
Marketable securities
Marketable securities, consisting principally of U.S. Government
securities, are carried at cost plus accrued interest, which approxi-
Imates market.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is deter-
mined principally on the first-in, first-out method.
Properties, rental equipment and depreciation
Properties and rental equipment are carried at cost and are depreci-
ated over the estimated lives of such assets using the straight-line
method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of
the asset lives or the terms of the respective leases. The principal
rates used are summarized below by classification of properties:
Revenue under costtype contracts is recognized when costs are
incurred, and under fixed-price contracts when products or services
are accepted and billings can be made. General and administrative
expenses are charged to income as incurred. Cost of revenue under
long-term contracts is charged based on current estimated total
costs. When estimates indicate a loss under a contract, cost of rev-
enue is charged with a provision for such loss.
Income taxes
Income taxes are provided on taxable income at the statutory rates
applicable to such income. Deferred taxes have not been provided
on the cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries
since such amounts are expected to be reinvested indefinitely.
Earnings per common share
In 1993 and 1992, the computation of primary earnings per share was
based on the weighted average number of outstanding common
shares and additional shares assuming the exercise of stock options.
The computation of fully diluted earnings per share for both years
further assumes the conversion of the 8% convertible subordinated
notes due August 1, 2000. The computation of fully diluted earnings
per share for 1993 further assumes conversion of Series A Cumu-
lative Convertible Preferred Stock. In 1991, both primary and fully
diluted earnings per common share were based on the weighted
average number of outstanding common shares. The inclusion of
additional shares assuming the conversion of Series A Cumulative
Convertible Preferred Stock would have been antidilutive in 1992
and 1991. The shares used in the computations for the three years
ended December 31, 1993 were as follows (in thousands):
LUnited Technologies-
UTC is established in all but
six of the world's countries, giving it a
global reach unique among U.S. companies.
Otis, Carrier, UT Automotive, Pratt &
Whitney, Sikorsky and Hamilton Standard,
on the strength of new ideas, are developing
business in every growing market, emerging
and established, where technology and
industry leading products are in demand.
The pages that follow illustrate UTC'a
activities in a changing world, market by
market, and actions to grow revenues in
the years ahead.
Segment Review
1994 Compared to 1995
Otis segment revenues for 1994 increased $226 million (5%)
over 1993. Increased revenues in Asia Pacific and North America
were partially offset by slightly lower revenues in Europe and Latin
America. Revenue increases in Asia Pacific were particularly signifi-
cant during 1994, in part from the increased investment made in
the Peoples Republic of China earlier in the year which allowed for
full consolidation. While lower new equipment volumes negatively
affected revenues in Europe and Latin America, the reduction was
partially offset by higher service revenues, The impact of the transla-
tion of foreign currency revenues into U.S, dollars was a negative
$19 rmillion for 1994.
Segment operating profits for Otis in 1994 increased $44 million
(12%4), improving in all regions with the exception of Latin Amer-
ica, Increases in Asia Pacific resulted primarily from the consolida-
tion of the PRC operations and the growth of the Asian market.
European results improved due to the higher service volumes,
Carrier segment revenues for 1994 increased $439 million (10%)
over 1993. Revenues were higher at Carrier Iransicold and in all
gographic regions except Europe where volumes were lower. Rev-
enue increases were particularly strong in North America reflecting
the impact of significant volume increases, The impact of the
translation of foreign currency revenues into U.S, dollars was not
significant during 1994.
CCarrier segment operating profits for 1994 increased $52 million
(23%) primarily due to improved results in North America and at
Carriers Transicold business, Operations in the PPeoples Republic of
China also showed continued strength and accounted for approxi-
mately 15% of Carriers operating profits over the last three years,
Automotive segment revenues increased $305 million (15%) in
1994 primarily due to higher North American industry volumes
and increased European market penetration.
Automotive segment operating profits for 1994 increased $54
million (25%4) over 1993. The increase is primarily attributable to
higher sales volumes and the absence of the 1993 charges to
rationalize certain manufacturing operations in Europe. PPartially
1995 Compared to 1992
Otis segment revenues decreased $94 million (2%) in 1993. The
impact of currency exchange rates versus the U.S, dollar reduced
revenues by approximately $278 million (6%) in 1995. Revenues
in 1995, exclusive of the translation impact, increased due to higher
service volumes in all regions, In addition, new equipment revenues
were slightly higher in 1993 primarily due to higher volumes in the
European and Latin American regions partially offset by lower
North American volume.
Otis segment operating profits increased $51 million (9%) in
1993. The translation impact of the stronger U.S. dollar negatively
impacted operating profits by $38 million. The improved operating
profits reflect the growth in service volumes during 1995. During
1995, increases in Latin American and European new equipment
volumes and improvement in Latin American new equipment mar-
gins also contributed to the growth.
Carrier segment revenues increased $152 million (4%) in 1993.
The translation of a stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted 1993
revenues by approximately $115 million (3%). 1995 revenues
reflect volume increases in the North American, Asia Pacific and
lLatin American regions as well as the transportation rerigeration
business, These increases were partially offset by the effects of the
continuing recession in Europe, particularly affecting the Spanish
and Italian operations,
Carrier segment operating profits increased $45 million (23%4)
in 1993. Improved operating profits resulting from increased vol-
umes and margins in the Asia Pacific and Latin American regions
were partially offset by the effects of the continuing recession in
Europe.
Automotive segment revenues were essentially unchanged
from 1992. During 1993 the segment was positively impacted by
increased North American car and light truck production and
European market penetration. Ihese increases were substantially
offset by the overall reduction in European vehicle production, the
negative translation impact of the stronger U.S, dollar of approxi
mately $112 million (5%6), and the absence of sales in 1993 from
certain automotive business units divested in the third quarter of
1992.
Automotive segment operating profits increased $15 million
(10%) in 1993. Operating profits during 1993 reflect the impact of
increased North American production volumes and European mar-
ket penetration, During 1995, these increases were partially offset
by the reduction in European vehicle production, charges to ratio-
nalize certain manufacturing operations in Europe and the absence
U.S. Government
The Corporation is now and believes that, in light of the current
government contracting environment, it will be the subject of one
or more government investigations. If the Corporation or one of its
business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any of
these investigations, the Corporation or one of its business units
could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new
government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings.
If convicted or found liable, the Corporation could be fined and
debarred from new government contracting for a period generally
not to exceed three years, Any contracts found to be tainted by
fraud could be voided by the Government.
The Corporations contracts with the U.S. Government are also
subject to audits, Like many defense contractors, the Corporation
has received audit reports which recommend that certain contract
prices should be reduced to comply with various government regu-
lations, Some of these audit reports involve substantial amounts,
The Corporation has made voluntary refunds in those cases it
believes appropriate.
Derivative Financial Instruments
T'he Corporation uses derivative financial instruments to
manage toreign currency and interest rate exposures in the follow-
ing tour areas: foreign currency transactions, foreign net assets.
customer financing assets, and debt. Derivative financial instru-
ments utilized by the Corporation in its foreign currency and
interest rate hedging activities are Over The Counter instruments
and involve little complexity. The Corporation has policies
to monitor the concentration and credit risks of counterparties,
which are a diversified group of major investment grade financial
institutions.
International operations, including export sales, constitute a sig-
nificant portion of the revenues and identifiable assets of the Cor-
poration, averaging approximately $11.8 billion and $4.6 billion,
respectively, for each of the last three years. Ihese operations result
in a large volume of foreign currency commitment and transaction
exposures and significant foreign currency net asset exposures, For-
eign currency commitment and transaction exposures are managed
at the operating unit level as an integral part of the business, Io the
extent that toreign currency exposures cannot be offset or managed
to an insignificant amount, it is the Corporations policy to hedge
these residual foreign currency commitment and transaction expo-
sures. Ihese hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the
timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and trans-
actions, It has been the Corporations policy to hedge a portion of
the impact of fluctuations in toreign currency exchange rates associ-
ated with these foreign investments, During 1994 the Corporation
substantially changed this policy and generally will not hedge for-
eign net asset exposures, Certain hedge contracts from the prior
policy are still outstanding and may be held until their scheduled
maturity.
The Corporation also has financing assets with commercial air-
line industry customers in connection with engine sale agreements,
The Corporation may sell customer financing assets from time to
time based on current market conditions and other factors, Io miti-
gate the exposure on certain fixed rate customer financing assets, the
Corporation has entered into interest rate swaps,
It has been the Corporations practice to manage the relative
proportions of its fixed rate and floating rate debt in the context of
the interest rate environment, expected cash flow and anticipated
debt retirements. While the hedging strategics on both debt and
customer financing assets are an integral portion of the Corpora-
tions risk management, the impact on earnings during the periods
were not material.
9ash Fow - Ney to 9rowth
In 1993, Unocal began to implement a ten-year plan for growth with
a strategy firmly focused on our basic businesses and core competi-
tive strengths. Our goals are aggressive, but our strategy is flexible
enough to allow us to respond quickly to changing energy markets
and emerging investment opportunities.
Cash flow from operations is the key to growth. We'll strengthen
cash flow over the next decade primarily by increasing energy re-
source production. We'll also emphasize cost control and continu-
ous improvement in all of our activities.
For the next three years, most production increases will come
from our accelerated North American development program, which
is centered on the Gulf of Mexico. This program, launched in 1993,
began to show results by year end. Lower-than-expected oil prices
at the beginning of 1994 caused us to shift our development em-
sphasis toward natural gas, where prices remain strong. This shift
and reduction in capital spending, if extended over most of the year,
may delay achievement of our production goals later in the decade.
Over the longer term, our growth strategy is based on expanding
our extensive oil, gas and geothermal operations in Southeast Asia.
We expect to help develop the energy resource potential in the
Greater Middle East, including the Caspian Sea, and other areas of
the world where our skills and technologies provide a competitive
edge. We will continue to forge strategic alliances and partnerships
to become more competitive in the global energy economy.

February 1994, could addd 50 million cubic feet per
day. The company holds a 25 percent interest. Ver-
milion block 528 (50 percent interest), also brought
on stream in February, is expected to produce 24
million cubic feet per day by June 1994.
OffShore Louisiana, Unocal has a 50 percent in-
terest in Garden Banks 191, on stream since Novem-
ber 1993 and expected to produce 160 million
cubic feet of gas per day by October 1994. Unocal
also holds a 50 percent interest in Garden Banks
189, which achieved peak gas production of 69 mil-
lion cubic feet per day in January 1994.
Onshore, Unocal logged new gas reserves in
Fresh Water Bayou in Louisiana in January 1994.
These reserves are in the same deep zone that has
dramatically boosted gas production in the North
Fresh Water Bayou field -- from 4 million cubic
feet per day in 1985 to 80 million cubic feet per day
in the last quarter of 1993.
Unocal discovered gas at Felicia Creek in Liberty
County, Texas, in January 1993 and brought a sec-

] vendor who shares the tricks of the trade as he strolls up
] and down the sunny stands. Both characters were creat-
] ed before the teams knew when the strike would be set-
l tled. Instead of taking an apologetic stance to woo sports
identity, The two networks struck a deal to operate
independently in their core regions while arranging
for help from their partner outside their native turf.
The joint venture created to do this, Publieis/FCB,
was 51% controlled by Publicis chairman Maurice
Levy and 49% by FCB chairman Bruce Mason.
The pact should have given FCB the ability to find
better European representation for its giant multina-
tional clients like Levis, R.J. Reynolds and Nabisco.
Similarly, Publicis should have found assistance in
introducing its European-based accounts, which
include L'Or&al, Cosmair and Philips, into the U.S.
But there were several basic flaws in the agreement.
First, FCB had no way of commanding the Publicis
network to provide quality service to its clients. Over
time, FCB clients such as Levis decided instead to
work with a host of non-Publicis agencies, including
Bartle Bogle Hegarty in Britain and McCann-Eriek-
son offices in parts of Europe, Latin America and
Asia. Meanwhile, the two parties cheated a bit. Levy
made no secret that he wanted his own U.S. network,
while Mason continued to explore ways of starting a
second, FCB-run network in the U.S.
Levy's opportunity to espand in the U.S. came two
years ago, when the financial floor under France's
Groupe FCA collapsed. Levy moved in to rescue it
and, in the process, acquired FCAs $100-million U.S.
subsidiary, Bloom FCA!. Mason considered that com-
petition without consultation and, according to SEC
filings, a violation of his master agreement with ILevy
Their differences perked along out of earshot for a
time, until Mason decided, apparently unilaterally, to
establish a new holding company. True North Com-
munications, to oversee Foote Cone. The restructur-
ing, done at the end of last year, signaled his readi-
ness to expand on his own around the world.
In February, Publicis expressed its outrage in fil-
ings with the French Stock Exchange that called for
the dissolution, through arbitration, of the
Publieis/FCB agreement. A few days later, True North
countered in similar fashion. These exchanges hit a low
Americans close to the situation take a caustic view
of it,The fight, says one observer, ''is not about money
It's about ego and wounded French pride.'' Mason
feels Levy never accepted the fact that FCB has a
legal right to act as a governor on Publicis' expansion
in the U.S.--and should have been allowed to force
Levy to shed Bloom FCA! when Levy purchased
Groupe FCA. Levy, no doubt, feels Mason has been
similarly unyielding in not helping him get American
and Asian representation for his European clients.
Agency mergers have proven sticky enough to do
when the cultures are only as different as New York
and Chicago (see Doyle Dane Bernbach and Needham
Harper). When they cross international borders,
without a clear acquirer and acquiree, they get even
murkier. Publicis/FCB was an interesting experi-

the bone-weary, decimated 7th Division
paused for a breather. We had come to
Okinawa directly from five months of
combat on Leyte in the Philippines. Now
whatever was left of the [apanese army,
whatever ground had to be taken, was
between us and the southern tip of the
island, which we could almost see. The
north end of Mabuni Hill, hill 89 (ele-
vation eighty-nine feet), shaped like a
short loaf of French bread, was in the
way, about a half-mile across a field.
ur small Counter Intel-
ligence Corps (CIC) de-
tachment included Miles
Matsumoto, a Hawaiian-
born Nisei who had been a student at
the Tokyo Technical Institute when he
caught the last boat to Honolulu be-
fore Pearl Harbor. He was a great in-
terpreter and translator, the very best.
If he had missed that boat, he would
have been drafted into the Japanese
army, Hrom interrogations of prison-
ers, Miles learned that General Ushiji-
ma, in command of the Japanese 32d
Army, his chief of staff, General Cho,
and the entire general staff were in a
cave on the south end of Mabuni.
It is no longer clear to me how it
came about that three of us in the CIC
detachment-Bill Attwood from New
York City, Miles, and I--would cross
the field to Mabuni, work along its ridge
to the south end, find the cave, and cap-
ture the command of the Japanese 32d
Army, Or so we thought, It was our
idea; nobody told us to do it, Like every-
thing else throughout the campaign,
we just did it, But for something like
that we must have spoken to the G-2,
and he probably said, without thinking
it through any more than we had, ''Go
ahead if you think you can do it,''
Early the next morning, June 21, the
three of us plus two Okinawan boetai
(work battalion) who knew the way
and a chui set off across the field. We
had captured the chui, a first lieutenant
in [apanese intelligence, early in the
campaign. Chui is [apanese for ''first
lieutenant.'' An intelligent man with
a commanding presence, he was not
eager to die for the emperor. He quick-
ly discovered that prisoners were well
treated, given medical attention, food,
and clothes, He knew defeat was in-
evitable, so he made it his mission,
working with our detachment, to save
as many of his countrymen as he could
by persuading them to surrender. He
saved many and no doubt some GIs
in the bargain, He was frustrated and
angry whenever he failed.
We made it easily to the near end of
Mabuni behind a bulldozer, its blade
raised as a kind of shield since we were
easy targets in an open field. The bull-
dozer operator waved good-bye, wished
us luck, and rumbled away quickly.
We followed a trail up the hill onto a
wooded ridge, then along it silently,
cautiously, Indian file, stopping fre-
quently to listen for human sounds,
Nothing. The Okinawans and the chui
were unarmed. Bill, Miles, and I car-
ried our carbines in a ready position.
Ready for what? We were more than
halfway to the end.
Suddenly, twenty yards ahead, a shell
burst, then another, and another-fire
from a knee mortar, a lightweight, very
short-range [apanese infantry weapon.
They were right there! How many? In-
stinct said run, and we didn't argue. As
we took off, another round burst close
enough to flatten Bill, Miles, and me; the
chui and the Okinawans ahead of us
kept running. Bill was stunned momen-
tarily when his helmeted head hit a rock,
but luckily there was no real injury, only
a few mortar fragments I caught in the
neck, We made it to the trail, scram-
bled down, and hustled across the field
to safety. The medics picked some met-
al out of my neck and patched me up.
The next morning we tried again (the
Okinawans extremely reluctant, but they
had no choice) behind the bulldozer,
up the trail, then very slowly along
the ridge. No fire. We pushed farther.
No fire. No sound. Then, all the way
to the end, where a knob of rock thrust
upward, the highest point on Mabu-
ni, The Okinawans led us cautiously
around the knob and down onto a
ledge, where they stopped. They were
very frightened. They pointed to the
back side of the knob, and there it was,
the cave, just as they had said. They
wanted to leave.
The cave opening (Okinawa is cov-
ered with caves, some wandering un-
derground endlessly) was less than three
feet wide, not as tall as a man, We were
very quiet, barely whispering. There was
no sign of any Japanese, no sound. A
crude wooden door was propped against
the entrance.
We worked as close as we could get
while trying to hold some cover, and
the chui called into the cave. No reply.
He tried again, and again, each time
something different. Silence. We assumed
the wooden door was booby-trapped,
so we tried dropping rocks onto it
from above, hoping to knock it over
or set off the trap. Nothing happened.
We were getting a little bolder. We
found a long, heavy electrical wire,
which I tossed at the door, hoping to
lasso a corner. It finally caught secure-
ly enough for me to pull it over while
keeping myself more or less defiladed
behind a rock, No booby trap.
We inched toward the entrance and
ducked our heads to walk in, We could
see some twenty-five feet or so to the
first bend. We had no lights, but we
needed none to understand the incred-
ible, gruesome scene at our feet, The
entire general staff in dress uniform,
one behind the other, all facing the
same way, had committed hara-kiri,
and very recently. Generals Ushijima and
Cho were not among them, We were
stunned, overwhelmed. After one glance
the Okinawans took off. The chui, shak-
ing with emotion, was completely silent
and remained so for a very long time.
We had almost nothing to say to one
another, What was there to say It was
not believable. We had found the cave
a pair of air tickets,
I had saved some money and had
vacation time coming, I felt this might
be my last opportunity, as I feared my
time left on earth was limited. My wife
had never flown, and I had never flown
in a jet.
We disembarked from the Ameri-
can Airlines plane in Düsseldorf, Ger-
many, after making a stop in Frank-
furt, less than nine hours after leav-
ing Chicago, My first flight across the
Atlantic, to England, had taken thir-
teen hours in a new B-17.
Never in my wildest dreams could
I have seen myself returning after for-
ty-four years to see and talk to the
people of Germany. What a contrast
with the first time!
After we left the plane, we heard
over the loudspeaker, in English, ''Mr.
and Mrs, Frank Clark, you have a
driver waiting for you at the main
entrance,'' We had wondered all across
the Atlantic how we were going to
get to Remscheid by ourselves,
At the entrance a young man took
our luggage and led us to a big black
Mercedes limousine, Amazed, we
climbed in, and we were off on the
autobahn at well over one hundred
miles per hour, When we arrived in
Remscheid, our driver took us to the
best hotel in town, where we were
shown to a beautiful room on the fifth
floor overlooking the city.
We had not been there five min-
utes when Richard Bremicker burst
into the room. Though he and I had
only corresponded, we embraced as if
we had known each other all our lives,
After a short visit he told us that
his driver would pick us up at noon.
We visited his beautiful home and then
his factory, where seventeen hundred
employees were manufacturing parts,
mostly door hinges, for the automo-
tive industry all over the world.
When our host learned that I was
interested in meeting with some of the
people in other towns who had writ-
ten me letters, he put his interpreter
at our disposal, and we were able to
reach several of them.
During one conversation I men-
tioned feeling particularly bad about
having bombed the college town of
Paderborn, a city with no military tar-
gets, Bremicker said Paderborn was
too far to drive, and without miss-
ing a beat, he hired a helicopter to
fly us there. Bremicker and his wife,
The Bremickers and an interpreter get ready to set off for Paderborn with Frank and Ruth Clark.
and research and to produce officers for interrogation.
As we began the search for documents, we met prob-
lems: the papers had been ''burned in air raids'' or ''de-
stroyed by ill-advised people'' and so on, Interrogations
were also hard going at the start, We thought it natural
to begin at the beginning: ''Where were you when the
war began?'' But this went slowly, perhaps because of fear
of war crimes problems or just because of the unprece-
dented nature of the exercise. But we found that when
we began at the middle or end of the war and got peo-
ple engaged, it was easy to work backward. In the end
we recorded 118 interrogations, an extremely valuable
body of material on the entire course of the Pacific war.
Interrogations, of course, brought up the language barrier,
astating air attacks; the loss of the Philippines had cut off
access to the Southern Resources Area for which the coun-
try had gone to war. By the summer of 1944, if not earlier,
Japan was in bad straits, The armed forces ran short of
both fuel and pilots; the food supply began to pinch; the
few automobiles that remained on the streets were run-
ning off charcoal. With surrender there had been some
concern that the occupation forces would attempt to live
off the land, but in a mixture of wise policy and impressive
logistics all our food came with us,
So also did tobacco. This was the cigarette-smoking age,
and a batch of naval officers, American and [apanese,
could produce a sizable quantity of butts in a day, When the
Meiji Building janitor appeared at the end of the after-
But not everyone in Tokyo could benefit from the sooth-
ing effects of American nicotine. Given the strains of a
long and lost war and the destruction inflicted by the
bombing campaign-deaths in the great March 9, 1945, fire
raid on Tokyo had exceeded those of either of the atomic
bombs-one might have expected some demonstrations
of hostility. In fact none developed, and our contacts with
individual Japanese, whether naval officers or waitresses,
were orderly, correct, and even, as time went by, friendly,
Early on, before our interrogation schedule got into full
swing, some of us toured the city, Although I am tall and
my uniform made me even more conspicuous, so that I felt
at the start a little like Gulliver among the Lilliputians, l got
no stares or double-takes anywhere, Except that pedes-
trian traffic seemed a little sparse and auto traffic sparser
-understandable enough with half the urban area burned
flat, 120,000 killed and wounded, and 1,000,000 homeless
-the central city seemed in many respects to have returned
to normal. Out walking one afternoon, I happened upon an
outdoor symphony concert being given in the tidied-up
shell of a bombed-out building. The orchestra members
were all in black tie, the conductor was an Austrian, the
music was Dvoiak's New World Symphony. Was there a
message here? Only the environment seemed out of place,
sue. In discussing the trend away from
the Complex Instruction Set Computer
(CISC) to the Reduced nstruction Set
Computer and, perhaps, eventually to
the Very Long bnstruction Word com-
puter, he mentions IBM's choice of
CISC architecture with System/360 in
the 1960s.
Although the first 360 systems were
not shipped until the early 1960s, plan-
ning for the 360 began in the mid-
19504. The result had as much to do
with political warfare between three
engineering groups (two in Pough-
keepsie and one in Endicott, New
York) as with technology. Many man-
hours were spent on trivialities, such
as an extended internal debate over bi-
nary versus decimal versus alphanu-
meric organization. None of IBM's top
management was comfortable with ar-
bitrating these kinds of decisions. By
tradition, all of them had come up
through IBM's sales organization.
None had computer experience or an
educational background conducive to
asking the right questions.
At that time, IBM's first high-level
language, FORTRAN, was still in devel-
opment, and even those who under-
stood it were skeptical that it would
ever be viable. ''Packaged'' application
programs were not even visualized.
Memory was precious and slow. High-
speed, intelligent 'cache'' memory did
not exist. It was ''obvious'' that any
new computing system should be bina-
ry, decimal and alphanumeric; make
maximum use of each memory cycle;
and be designed for non-technical peo-
ple who had to program commercial
applications in assembly languagW-
The 360 architecture was to become a
serious constraint on future IBM sys-
tems. Its computational deficiencies led
to the sale of Control Data's 6600 in ma-
jor scientific centers and to IBM's even-
tual decline in the ''scientific'' market.
I hindsight, the 360 should have been
more RISC-like-but more importantly,
it should have been designed for the
programmers who write compilers.

Expanding the Contract
To the Editors:
In the March-April issue, Kumar Patel
has proposed ''A Research Contract With
America'' as a kind of code of ethics to be
followed by all ''moral'' researchers.
The serious problem is that his fourth
article of faith is based on an unques-
tionable reliance on a peer-review sys-
tem. As was recently emphasized by
many reputable scholars, peer review in
its present (anonymous) form is prone
to all sorts of abuses and conflicts of in-
terest. This largely stems from the utter
inequality between the grant applicant
and his/her secret ''judges'' (peer re-
viewers). By its very definition, peer re-
viewers are active researchers in the
same area and, consequently, with all
the good will on earth, cannot be free
from up-front conflicts of interest. In
any juddicial system we will not tolerate
(at least in democracies) anonymous
judges or anonymous witnesses. And
yet we uncritically swallow this practice
in supporting an anonymous peer-re-
view system in science.
Abuses of anonymous peer review
are too numerous to be discounted as
''insignificant exceptions.'' The whole
system calls for an urgent reform to-
wards more openness, accountability
and democracy of the entire peer-eval-
uation process. Unless and until the
anonymity of a peer-review system is
abolished, its inclusion as a part of the
research code of ethics has an itself
highly questionable grounds. Without
this fundamental qualification, Dr. Pa-
tel's proposal is ethically flawed. It is
imperative that the proposed code be
amended with an explicit provision of
public accountability of the peer-re-
view process itself.

To the Editors:
In response to Kumar Patel's excellent
editorial, ''A Research Contract With
America,'' it may be said that a con-
tract is an obligation of both parties
based on a common understanding.
The basic research enterprise contract
with American was based on national
survival during World War II and the
Cold War, and both are over.
During much of this century scien-
tists, professors, teachers and doctors
were perceived as members of commu-
nities working for the benefit of
mankind. Today, scientists, professors,
teachers and doctors are not accorded
by the public special respect as profes-
sionals. They are viewed by many peo-
ple as members of commercially minded
interest groups representing corporate
interests, or as self-serving individuals.
ESSSSRS
from the time suggest the fewish population to
have been between 10.000 and 100.000 when the
first person acquired the mutation.
When Risch and his colleagues calculated the
present-day frequency of the mutation, they
were shocked to find that the frequency of
Ashkenazi [ewish carriers of this deleterious
mutation has increased by as much as 100-fold.
The scientists estimate that anywhere between
one in 1,000 and one in 3,000 Ashkenazi Jews
now carry the mutation.
How could the number of carriers have
expanded so dramatically? Risch and his col-
leagues also found that at the time of the original
mutation, the birth and survival rates for
Ashkenazi Jews was higher for affluent than for
lower-class families. They propose that these
affluent families produced more surviving chil-
diren than did lower-class families. Any mutations
*here may be yet another way to get de-
i pressed. Faulty neurochemistry and psychic
ll trauma notwithstanding, it looks as though
a virus known to infect domestic animals may
also play a role in the depressive illnesses of some
psychiatric patients. In the March issue of Nature
Medicine, Liv Bode of the Robert Koch Institute in
Berlin and her colleagues report the detection of
genetic material from the Borna disease virus in
cells from a small group of patients who were hos-
pitalized for chronic or acute depression.
The report is a follow-up to previous studdies
by German scientists that hadd shown that about
10 to 15 percent of neuropsychiatric patients had
antibodies to the Borna disease virus in their
blood, whereas only about two percent of a nor-
mal control population had the antibodies. Re-
markably, in these studies nearly 30 percent of
those who were hospitalized for acute episodes
of major depression had the Borna antibodies.
The presence of Borna virus antiboddies in a pa-
tient's blood is not definitive proof that he or she
has been infected with the virus. With the discov-
ery of Borna viral nucleic acids in four of six psy-
chiatric patients, however, Bode and her col-
leagues provide further support for the notion that
either the animal virus (or a related human viral
strain) is indeed an infectious agent in people.
If so, the virus may be the cause of the pa-
tients' psychiatric illness. Some other observa-
tions by Bode and her colleagues suggest that
this may be the case. In particular, the depres-
sive episodes in two acutely depressed patients
were associated with the presence of antibodies
to the Borna virus and Borna viral nucleic acids
in monocytes from the patients' blood. The de-
pressive symptoms of both patients decreased
with the decline of viral activity in their blood.
These observations are striking in the light of
the virus's effects on animal hosts. Sporaddic be-
arising in this population, therefore, would have
been expanded more rapidly than mutations aris-
ing in less affluent classes. The scientists suggest
that the present-day Ashkenazi Jews may repre-
sent the descendents of a fairly small number
about a thousand or so) of this affluent group.
Medical geneticist Arno Motulsky of the
University of Washington at Seattle, who com-
mented on the Risch group's work in the same
issue of Nnture Genetics, says the Kisch group has
presented an interesting and plausible story, but
one that needs to be confirmed by tracing the his-
tory of several more genes in the Ashkenazi
Jewish population. Risch agrees, but he points out
that the evidence for the impact of genetic drift
can be seen in other populations that, like the
lews, have expanded rapidly and have tended to
be endogamous--among them French Canadians,
the Amish and the Finns.--Michelle Hoffan
havioral abnormalities (described as ''hypersom-
nia'' and ''brain fever'') in horses with the disease
have been recognized for nearly 200 years, Experi-
mental infections of laboratory animals (rabbits,
rats, tree shrews and non-human primates) pro-
duce a variety of behavioral symptoms ranging
from) agitation and aggression to abnormal social
interactions. Some infected animals display symp-
toms associated with human depression, includding
excessive sleeping, passiveness and cognitive dif-
ficulties. Curiously, other species (mice and ham-
sters) do not manifest any abnormal behavior in
response to experimental infections of the virus.
As yet there is no firmly established model of
how the Borna disease virus might cause behav-
ioral abnormalities in animals or in people. Post-
mortem studies of animals with Borna disease sug-
gest that the virus targets certain parts of the limbic
system, a complex of structures in the brain that is
known to be involved in the expression of emo-
tions and affective disorders. Neurons in the hypo-
thalamus and the hippocampus appear to be espe-
cially prone to destruction by Borna viral infections.
Another hint of the pathogenic mechanism
comes from a recent study by Georg Gosztonyi
and his colleagues of the Free University in
Berlin. These authors showed that the Borna dis-
ease virus may interact with receptors in the hip-
pocampus for the excitatory amino acid neuro-
transmitters, aspartate and glutamate (Lnboratory
Indestigation March 1, 1993). Whether neuronal
destruction or neurochemical disruptions are in-
volved in human disease remains to be seen.
Although the animal and human studies are
Suggestive, virologist Joanna f'yper of the Johns

Bode and colleagues' work in the same issue of
Nature Medicine, believes that the authors haven't
q;uite ''nailed'' the link between Borna disease
virus and human neuropsychiatric illnesses. She
Colloidal Crystals
Solid particles suspended in fluid form ordered arrays
zvith unusual and useful physical properties
Cherry A. Murray and David G. Grier
Tt seems an easy, almost trivial task to
1lidentify the states of matter that we
encounter in everyday life. Take a walk
in the woods and it is clear that the
trees are solid, the water in the creek is
liquid and the air, a gas. But what
about the cells that make up the tree, or
the mud at the bottom of the creek?
What state of matter do they fall into?
Are they solid or fluid? The answer is
both and neither.
Cells and silt are both colloids, solid
particles suspended in a fluid. Colloids
differ from solutions in that the parti-
cles are large-on the order of macro-
molecules such as fat, DNA or protein.
In fact, colloid particles are approxi-
mately 1,000 times the size of the mole-
cules making up the fluid. And they
are not dissolved in the fluid, but
rather are dispersed throughout it. As
such, colloids represent a state of mat-
ter with properties unlike those of ei-
ther the particles or the fluid.

If the suspended particles are espe-
cially large-comparable to the wave-
lengths of visible light-the colloid ac-
quires optical properties distinct from
those of bulk materials. Repeated scat-
tering of light in a suspension of ran-
domly distributed fat particles produces
the cloudy opacity characteristic of milk.
The ability of colloids to scatter light was
recognized and exploited long before
people could even begin to describe the
chemical nature of colloids. Ink is one of
the earliest manufactured colloids, used
in ancient Egypt and China. Latex paint
is a more recent invention made of latex
spheres suspended in water.
More unusual still are the optical
properties exhibited by ordered arrays
of colloidal particles. Under the right
conditions, colloidal particles arrange
themselves into ordered ranks, much
like the atoms in a crystal. But these col-
loidal crystals can be made to ''melt''
into a disordered colloidal fluid again if
their container is shaken, as discovered
by Bruce Ackerson of Oklahoma State
University and Noel Clark of the Uni-
versity of Colorado in 1981. An ordered
array of latex spheres in water gives off
vividly iridescent light, similar to that
of a gem opal--which is also a colloidal
crystal of silica spheres from which the
liquid has dried. The same optical
properties that make opals beautiful
can also have applications in advanced
optics and optoelectronics. [ust as con-
ventional crystals are used as mono-
chromators for x rays, colloidal crystals
have been marketed as notch filters for
visible light by Sandy Asher of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh.
Many of the intriguing properties of
colloids are experimentally accessible,
as the large size of particles in colloids
also makes these suspensions ideal
subjects for scientific study. Unlike
atoms, colloidal particles with diame-
ters in the range of 0.1-1 micrometer in
diameter can be easily seen under a
light microscope, and their motions
tracked with high resolution using dig-
ital-image processing. We have focused
our own studies on colloids of tailored
size distributions as a simple, unique
model system for studying the physics
of classical many particle systems. Our
studies of monodisperse colloids (in
which the size and spherical shape of
the particles and the net charges that
are chemically fixed on their surfaces
by sulfonate groups are all identical to
within one percent) promise a deeper
understanding of how colloidal sus-
pensions obtain some of their extraor-
dinary properties, but they also pro-
vide new insights into the behavior of
conventional materials and the mecha-
nisms of their transitions.
Properties of Colloids
All colloids are defined by the large
size of the suspended particles and by
the way those particles move in sus-
pension. The particles are larger than
single dissolved molecules, but are still
small enough that random thermal
''kicks'' delivered by the fluid send
them on unpredictable random walks
and greatly reduce the rate at which
they sediment under the influence of
gravity. This motion of particles was
described in 1828 by Scottish botanist
Robert Brown, who noted the erratic
movement of pollen grains suspended
in water and later the same motion for
pigments in dyes. This kind of move-
ment has since been termed ''Brown-
ian motion'' and is a defining feature
of colloids. Beyond Brownian motion
and the size range of particles, the par-
during the first testing phase, it was
stronger in the last testing phase. The
average score was 87 percent in the
case of stimuli that had been reas-
signed and 72 percent in the case of
stimuli that had not been reassigned.
In other words, the generalization of
retraining to all members of a category
reliably exceeded the level of chance.
Merely by being associated with a
common response, perceptually dis-
parate stimuli had amalgamated into a
new category of functionally equiva-
lent stimuli.
We were understandably pleased
with our pigeons' performance, but
without a basis of comparison, we
weren't sure how pleased to be. To find
out we tried an analogous experiment
with 20 preschool children. The chil-
dren's response board was a large
white poster with one central and four
peripheral boxes. The children were
asked to place one of the 48 snapshots
used in the pigeon experiment in the
correct box. The investigator first
placed a photograph in the central box
and asked the child to move it to one of
two boxes on a diagonal. (The boxes on
the other diagonal were covered by
large X's to mark them as unavailable.)
If the child responded correctly, the in-
vestigator said ''that is correct,'' and if
he or she responded incorrectly, the in-
vestigator said ''that is incorrect.'' Un-
like the pigeons, the children were not
given correction trials if they responded
incorrectly.
When a child had achieved a score of
90 percent during at least one 12-trial
training block, he or she underwent re-
assignment training. During this step of
the experiment, two of the stimulus
classes were reassigned to the previous-
ly unavailable boxes. Once a child had
reached 90 percent accuracy with the re-
assigned stimuli, he or she was shown
all 48 photographs in succession in a
single testing period. The boxes avail-
able during testing were the same two
available during reassignment training,
and the reinforcement schedule for
withheld stimuli was nondifferential.
The children's average score was 99 per-
cent for stimuli that had been reas-
signed and 80 percent for stimuli that
had not been reassigned.
Compared to pigeons, the children
mastered the discrimination task faster
and reached higher levels of accuracy;
nevertheless the children's perfor-
mance was roughly comparable to that
of the pigeons. If the children respond-
ed correctly to reassigned stimuli 99
percent of the time, the pigeons re-
sponded correctly 87 percent of the
time during the equivalent testing
phase of their longer experimental pro-
tocol. If the children responded cor-
rectly to stimuli that had not been reas-
signed 80 percent of the time, the
pigeons responded correctly 78 percent
of the time. In both cases, association
with a common response was clearly
sufficient to create a class of functional-
ly equivalent stimuli.
These experiments were deliberately
designed in such a way that the princi-
ple of perceptual proximity invoked to
explain the earlier set of experiments
did not apply to them. What rule of
learning do they support?
A more advanced principle of asso-
ciative learning appears to fit the inter-
pretive bill. When two classes of stim-
uli are associated with a common overt
response during training, they may
come to elicit a common covert re-
sponse, perhaps a fractional or antici-
patory version of the final overt re-
sponse. Such a covert response might
well serve as the bridge that allows
stimuli withheld during reassignment
training to produce the same response
as the reassigned stimuli with which
they had been associated.
Invoking a covert mediating re-
sponse that can be shaped in much the
same way as an overt response is an old
theoretical maneuver of associationist
psychologists such as C. E. Osgood and
B. . Underwood. But the mediated re-
sponse has recently undergone a high-
tech reincarnation; a hidden layer of
nodes in a multilayer neural network
provides a means of representing high-
er-level abstractions inferred from input
data, an ability beyond the scope of sim-
pler networks.
If the mediating response still seems
implausible, consider a more familiar
example of reassignment training. Chil-
dren routinely learn to call socks, belts,
pants and hats ''clothing.'' This associa-
tive process, which probably proceeds
by rote memorization, can be a very
slow affair. Yet when children later learn
that 'apparel'' is a synonym for ''cloth-
ing,' they are instantly able to call socks,
belts, pants and hats ''apparel,' and do
not need to explicitly learn that each ar-
ticle is a member of the new category.
The word ''clothing'' might well serve
as a bridge between socks, belts, pants
and hats and the word ''apparel,'' even
though the child never says or is even
aware of thinking this word.

tipped off about the action by an associate in the Zedillo

This is, needless to say, not the way we expected busi-
ness to be conducted in the newest of First World countries.
In Mexico City in March, I asked a dozen people-liberal,

enue-sharing in the 1970s, and warns
against repeating those errors now. States
spend money sent them from
Washington with far less care than the
money they raise from their own taxpay-
ers. The arrival of billions of federal dol-
lars is more likely to relieve the states of
fiscal pressure to reform welfare and
Medicaid than to spur dramatic action,
especially since, as liberal welfare critic
Mickey Kaus has written, the prevailing
image of governors as reform crusaders
is utterly mistaken.
On the other hand, Pat Roberts's
Four Days in February should remind us
that even a Republican-dominated
Congress will almost certainly fail to
write an adequate welfare reform bill.
By the time Congress finishes with its
compromises and concessions, the
reform that emerges will not amount to
very much. Interviewed in March,
Charles Murray said he remained cer-
tain that the only route to substantial
reform lay through the state capitals.
''With welfare,'' Murray said, ''the only
way to get major reform is if one state
demonstrates a very large effect and
also demonstrates that you won't have
kids starving in the streets''--by, for
example, eliminating all its existing
welfare programs and devoting the
money instead to adoption services.
So who is right?
<Spite the effective arguments of
j he block grant critics, he nod
A has to go to the decentralizers. It
should be clear by now that Murray got it
right about the possibilities for real
reform in the House. Now just imagine
what the far more conventional Senate
will do.
As for the infirmities of state govern-
ments, remember that block grants,
unlike Nixon-era revenue sharing, are
not exactly free money. These grants will
come attached to substantial new respon-
sibilities for the states. And they will
quickly prove far more fiscally constrict-
ing than most observers yet appreciate.
Welfare programs are now designed
for limitless growth. Medicaid is perhaps
the single most shocking example-up
from $20 billion a decade ago to nearly
$100 billion this year-but other pro-
grams, like Supplemental Security
Income, are mushrooming nearly as fast.
For Washington to control these costs, it
would have to rewrite the rules govern-
ing the programs-a complicated, politi-
cally fraught, and time-consuming busi-
ness for a Republican majority with
much else on its agenda.
Devolution offers Republicans the
chance to say, ''That's it! The national
contribution to the relief of poverty is''--
pick a number-''and not a dime more. It
will be that same amount next year, or
quite possibly less, but it will be a number
set as the result of democratic choice, and
not by some out-of-control budget mecha-
nism.'' What would that mean in practice?
Picture a dog on a long chain that spots a
cat across the road. It jumps upright and
sprints at top speed across the lawn--until
the chain snaps it backward.
Or, if you want numbers, look north-
ward at the Canadian experience. Virtually
all of Canada's social programs are admin-
istered by the provinces; Ottawa tradition-
ally absorbed roughly half the costs. When
the debt-plagued federal government
decides to scale back, as it periodically
does, all it need do is cut along the dotted
line-one reason that the Canadian federal
budget unveiled on February 27 could
deliver actual dollar decreases in spending
on programs: CS119 billion was spent in
the 1994-95 fiscal year; C$112 billion is
budgeted for 1995-96.
The present division of welfare
responsibilities between Washington and
the states tempts local governments into
reckless choices. Mario Cuomo's New
York spent twice as much per patient on
Medicaid as California, largely because
the governor convinced a large chunk of
his voters that the bill was being paid by
Washington--as indeed nearly half of it
was. (With 7 percent of the nation's
population and 9 percent of its Medicaid
patients, New York accounted for 20
percent of all federal Medicaid spending
in Cuomo's last year in office.)
There are only two ways out of this
fix: either Washington must assert dra-
matically more authority over local deci-
sion-making, which few Republicans
would favor, or else it must assert much
less. States might abuse their new free-
dom by stubbornly refusing to reform,
but that would be their taxpayers' prob-
lem. With the status quo costing more
and more, and Washington contributing
(as it surely will) less and less, even the
most troglodyte states will eventually
succumb to reform. (1
T3he moral of Donald Kagan's wise
i and compelling book was
L summed up neatly by the Roman
military commentator Flavius Ve-
getius-si vis pacem, para bellum: ''If
you want peace, prepare for war,''
Kagan, former dean of Yale College and
now Bass Professor of History, Classics,
and Western Civilization at the universi-
ty, puts it thus: ''Peace does not keep it-
self,'' Variations of the phrase recur in
nearly every chapter of On the Origins of
Waar. It is his theme, his message, his
plea. ''If the goal is to preserve peace,''
Kagan writes, ''the worst mistake we can
make is to take inadequate measures to
that end because we do not comprehend
the nature of the problem.''
Why do men go to war? Kagan argues
that the best answer to the question is still
that of Thucydides-people wage war
because honor, fear, or interest seems to
demand it. We can understand the latter
two, but ''honor'' is more difficult; for
many of us, the word has an archaic ring.
The Greek word, time, encompasses not
only ''honor'' but also ''esteem,'' ''worth,''
''prestige,' amour propre.
In this book Kagan examines four wars,
two ancient and two modern-the
Peloponnesian War, the First World War,
the Second Punic War, the Second World
War--and one near-war-the Cuban mis-
sile crisis. It is striking, he notes, what a rel-
atively small role ''considerations of practi-
cal utility and material gain'' played in these
conflicts. Fear was an important factor in
some of them. But perhaps the most impor-
tant consideration in each was time.
Professor Kagan has structured his
book as a series of object lessons. The
first two chapters, on the Peloponnesian
War (431-404 B.C.) and the First World
War, form one pair. In these cases, the
balance of power was upset by the swift
expansion of power on one side: the
growth of the Athenian empire in the
years following the war between the
Persian Empire and the Greeks, and
Germany's drive to win European pre-
eminence in the years after Bismarck's
death. Athens struggled to keep the
peace when a complicated system of
alliances was shaken by a few renegade
city states, but Pericles pursued a policy
that ''was either too weak or too strong'':
too weak to prevent an outlying city
from revolting, too strong to assuage
Sparta's alarm about Athens's ultimate
intentions.
Similarly, the growth of German
power between 1898 and 1914 meant
that only ''a large, well-trained British
army that could quickly come to
France's aid in case of attack'' could
secure peace. To create such an army, the
British would have had to require con-
scription and the maintenance of a large
standing army in peacetime-an almost
unthinkable contingency in nineteenth-
and early twentieth-century Britain,
although even the liberal John Stuart
Mill was in favor of it after the ignomin-
ious defeat of France in the Franco-
Prussian War. Real preparedness, how-
ever, was beyond the will of the British.
As with the Athenians, ''their refusal to
adjust their strategic capacity to their
policy undermined their ability to con-
duct that policy.'' What seemed like the
counsel of prudence turned out to be a
recipe for vacillation and indecisiveness:
qualities that form a nearly irresistible
invitation to disaster.
Kagan's discussion of ''Hannibal's
War'' (the Second Punic War) and the
Second World War present a different

gor a while tthere in March it looked
jri baa. This ime de Yanks had gone
lL too far. In tacos bars, in bowling
alleys, at Safeway checkouts-wherever
Englishmen traditionally gather-there
was whispered talk of general mobilization
and of warehouses full of call-up papers.
The Brigade of Guards had been taking
part in massive exercises on Salisbury
Plain, it was said, and with live ammuni-
tion; a squadron of Tornado GR1s had
been sent to Bermuda, flying at sea level
to avoid detection by U.S. radar; a pair of
Trident submarines had been spotted head-
ing down the Clyde Estuary for the North
Atlantic; John Mills had been seen enter-
ing the Admiralty wearing a khaki duffel
coat and a plucky frown ...
President Clinton's decision to invite
Gerry Adams to the White House on St.
Patrick's Day, against the express wishes of
the British government, and to allow him to
raise funds in the U.S.-inspired a magnifi-
cent outbreak of anti-American fury here.
Even sane and sensible people were hurt.
John Major was so hurt that he refused to
take a telephone call from the president, and
went off to the Middle East to shake hands
with Yassir Arafat. The wolfish Adams is
the nearest thing we have to an Arafat. As
head of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army, he is up to his
molars in blood. The IRA is not an army,
and it does not represent the Irish Republic.
It is a terrorist organization that since 1969
has murdered more than 3,000 Britons. No
wonder the English sometimes make
unkind (and probably illegal) jokes about
their Hibernian cousins. Question: Why did
the Irish get all the potatoes and the Saudi
Arabians all the oil? Answer: Because the
Irish had first choice.
By far the most interesting, and
extreme, contribution to the Clinton-
Adams debate was made by John
Charmley, author of the recent critical life
of Winston Churchill. In the Sunday
Telegraph, he aimed his sawn-off (but
elegantly fashioned) shotgun at the entire
American people, from Davy Crockett to
Ollie North. The real problem, he wrote,
was that America had always been an
Imperial Republic intent on mischief.
''Using the rhetoric of messianic
righteousness,'' he argued, ''its rulers
first displaced the indigenous inhabitants
of their continent before going on to lec-
ture the rest of the world on 'human
rights.''' Wilson and Roosevelt between
them had helped to dismantle the British
Empire, and now Clinton was, in effect,
demanding an end to the union between
Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
r4 Isewhere columnists concentrated
i4 heir fire on the president, who was
k charged--can you believe it?-with
being more concerned to win the hearts and
minds and votes of his 40-million-strong
Irish-American constituency than to make
John Major a happy prime minister. In the
Suday Express Bruce Anderson delivered
himself of the not especially original idea
that Clinton was the worst president in
American history. ''Behind the glad-hand-
ing, the smiles and the poses, the inner man
is negligible,' he wrote. ''There is no centre
of gravity, no principle, no integrity: noth-
ing... the decision to allow Gerry Adams
and Sinn Fein to raise funds in America
takes Clinton to new depths of ignominy.'
One hesitates to defend Clinton, but
since Sinn Fein is allowed to raise money
in Great Britain there seems little reason
why it should not be allowed to raise
funds in the United States. The British
government is employing a double stan-
dard, and not just in the matter of
fundraising. It has itself been courting
Ohio; and Pueblo San MIarcos,

once controlled the nearby Cerrillos

ble for five preserves in heavily

century. Each spans a different
Caddo period, allowing continued
research on this most important of
early American chiefdoms. The
100th property, obtained in late
1994, is the three-acre Lamb Spring
site near Littleton, Colorado, a
Paleo-Indian hunting and game-
processing area that may be one of
the earliest of its kind in the United
States.
The Conservancy accepts sites as
gifts, and works closely with land
developers whose projects impinge
on prehistoric and historic sites,
They have achieved some remark-
able successes. In 1993 the Weyer-
hauser Real Estate Company was
developing a planned community
on the site of Fort Nisqually, a
Hudson's Bay Company trading
post founded in 1832. The Conser-
vancy persuaded Weyerhauser to set
aside the site as open space in the
heart of its new community, E.I.
duPont de Nemours Company
donated an archaeological easement
on the site of Old Mobile, Ala-
bama, the first French settlement at
NIobile 1702 -1711;. Such transac-
tions benefit not only archaeology,
but the developer, who receives a
tax break and, more important, a
positive public image, In other
cases, the Conseryancy purchases
sites outright for the appraised value
of the land. The funds come from
its 13,000 members, corporate
sponsors, and private foundations.
In purchasing the Lamb Spring site,
the Conservancy collaborated with
the Denver MIuseum of Natural
History. The two organizations
raised matching funds against a
grant of $100,000 from the Col-
orado State Historical Fund.

Dionysos, a Corinthian temple dedicated to the
emperor Antoninus Pius (A.D. 138-161), and a two-
story-high fountain with a facade of niches framed by
columns. Wealthy local families vied to outspend each
other on monumental civic projects, Shortly after A.D.
120, one T. Flavius Severianus Neon financed the con-
struction of a new library in the upper city, The family
of T. Flavius Collega remodeled the old temple to
Apollo Klarios and transformed it into a sanctuary of
the emperor cult. Between A.D. 160 and 180 a
nymphaeum, or monumental fountain, in the form of a
theater facade was built along the northern side of the
upper agora, Last year, during the excavation of the
fountain, we uncovered five greater-than-life-size stat-
ues that once adorned its niches. These were carved in
fine marble imported from as far away as Dokimeion
and Aphrodisias, about 100 miles to the northeast and
west, respectively. In the late second and early third
centuries A.D., the city built a new macellum, or food
market, a large open-air theater, and a monumental
gateway,
T'he mid-third century saw more wars in Asia
Ninor, including Gothic incursions in A.D. 255277
and an invasion by Zenobia, queen of Palmyra in
Syria, in A.D. 270. But Sagalassos seems not to have
suffered from these upheavals: the abundance of small-
denomination coins issued by the city probably reflects
a flourishing state of commerce. Indeed the city sold
grain to the Roman armies in the East, or so it would
seem from the many coins with depictions of wheat
and legends reading ''friend and ally of the Romans,''
Sagalassos witnessed another period of prosperity in
the mid-fourth and early fifth centuries A.D. Gothic and
Isaurian invasions of Pisidia in the later fourth century
forced the Romans to station a new garrison in Side,
60 miles to the southeast, and Sagalassos seems once
more to have reaped profits from grain deliveries to
the armies. During Julian's reign (A.D. 361-363), the
second-century library was renovated and embellished
with a mosaic depicting Achilles' departure for the
Trojan War. Construction activity culminated during
the late fourth century, when both agoras were
repaved and furnished with shops and porticoes, and a
number of new monuments were built honoring mem-
bers of the Imperial family. Sometime during this
period Sagalassos became an important bishopric, for
the city was represented at the First Council of Con-
stantinople in A.D. 381, which declared the Trinity to
be an essential tenet of Christian doctrine.
There are signs that Goths or Isaurians eventually
reached Sagalassos. Shortly after A.D. 400 the inhabi-
tants built an impressive fortification wall around the
civic center that incorporated a number of public
buildings. The Kakasbos temple was turned into a
watchtower that overlooked the northern approach to
the city, Construction of churches out of stone pilfered
from earlier monuments may mark the beginning of a
decline in the city's fortunes, Earthquakes struck in A.D.
518 and 528, toppling buildings and destroying aque-
ducts. Primitive systems captured water where it was
still present, while squatters built makeshift homes
inside porticoes and other public buildings. According
to ancient historians, catastrophe struck once more in
A.D. 541-543, this time in the form of a plague that
killed nearly half of Anatolia's population. Ceramic
production ended in the city, though it has continued
in the valleys below in a debased form until today.
Sagalassos seems to have been abandoned shortly
after the middle of the seventh century, the date of the
latest artifacts (coins and small terra-cotta amphorae
known as unguentaria) discovered so far, Arabs invading
from Syria between A.D. 644 and 696 may have dealt
the final blow, convincing a shrunken population to
give up a city that it could no longer defend. Some of
the inhabitants settled in nearby Alasun, where the
bishopric of Sagalassos survived until the twelfth cen-
tury, Pollen samples from A.D. 400--1050 indicate that
pine forests gradually replaced the nut orchards that
had flourished since the sixteenth century B.C. An
increase of sheep and goat remains during this period
may reflect a neglect of fields in favor of herding, a rel-
atively low-intensity form of food production. This shift
toward herding, together with the recovery of the
forests, points to a declining population. After ca. 1050
the pollen record shows signs of shrinking forests and
overgrazing, perhaps caused by the arrival of Turkmen
tribesmen from Iran. This chronic abuse of the land
eventually produced the scoured landscape we see
today.
Our excavations at Sagalassos are far from com-
plete, but we have already learned a great deal about
one of the best preserved provincial towns of classical
antiquity, Our quest for the past hhas been full of sur-
prises. WWe have identified one of the major ceramic
producers of Roman Asia Minor, a source whose wares
flooded southern Turkey for five centuries. WWe have
also begun to discredit an age-old myth about the
region's people. Ancient historians tell of a Hellenistic
Pisidia inhabited solely by tribal barbarians living by
pillaging and brigandage, and this image has survived
in a great deal of modern scholarship. Perhaps a sense
of accomplishment at conquering such a warlike people
led Roman chroniclers to glorify themselves at the
expense of their new subjects, WWith its sculptures and
temples, its agoras and fountains, Sagalassos was any-
thing but uncivilized and uncultured, Those same
''barbarian'' Pisidians had helped make it a cosmopoli-
tan and thoroughly Hellenized city, ss
loquially called the Jerusalem Syndrome,
an affliction peculiar to travelers to Jer-
usalem who snap under the historical and
religious weight of the city and begin to
believe that they themselves are the Mes-
siah or the Virgin or King David or, more
commonly, God or Satan. Many of these
people have strikingly similar spiritual
histories: a deeply religious childhood
followed by an adolescent rebellion
against their faith and an eventual falling
away. Backsliders appear to be far more
vulnerable to the syndrome, because their
image of Jerusalem is sometimes drawn
in a child's hand, unamended by adult
reasoning.
The sufferers are of two types-those
who arrive in Jerusalem with a history of
psychological or behavioral problems and
those without any sign or record of past
psychiatric problems. The former group
comprises 82 percent of the sufferers, ac-
cording to Witztum. But those in the latter
group, who are exhibiting what psychia-
trists call the syndrome proper, are the
more perplexing of the two types, Most
believe for an average of five to seven
days that they are some form of divinity;
then they step back into the milder reli-
gious atmosphere of America or Europe
as if nothing had happened. Of these,
most are surprisingly responsive to thera-
py, Witztum described one such patient
who spoke of the experience as being
rather like intoxication. In the summer of
1986 he entered the Holy Sepulchre and
was overcome by the feeling that he was
Jesus. When he began sharing this con-
viction aloud with his tour group, he was
taken to Kfar Shaul psychiatric hospital,
where he was treated by the hospital's di-
rector, Yair Bar El. Within five days he
was fine. He returned to his homeland,
got married, and remains baffled about
what happened. He is extraordinarily po-
lite, as are many of the victims of the
syndrome proper, most of whom don't
rant but simply worry that they might be
Jesus.
The former patient would like to return
to Jerusalem for a visit but worries that
the syndrome will strike again-as if Je-
rusalem were the problem. Witztum con-
curs, ''This case was a reaction to a place,
not a true psychosis,'' he says, In a new
entry on the syndrome in the Encyclopae-
dia Britannica, the question is asked,
''Does Jerusalem's religious atmosphere
actually induce psychiatric disturbance in
the vulnerable visitor?'' Though there is
no definitive answer yet, Witztum be-
lieves that the ''unique atmosphere'' of
Jerusalem together with the complexities
of the human psyche may be more than
some travelers can manage.
In order to explain the syndrome, Witz-
tum differentiates between pilgrims and
tourists. A tourist moves from the center
of his existence, his home, to the periph-
ery, in order to vacation. A pilgrim, how-
ever, moves from the periphery to the
center of his world. Perhaps the best defi-
nition of ''center'' in this context was giv-
en by the religious historian Mircea Eli-
ade, who wrote that the center is where
the ''axis mundi [the center axis of mean-
ing] penetrates the earthly sphere.''
Once a tiny hilltop fortification, Jerusa-
lem has come to be the axis mundi for
three of the world's major religions, where
heaven descends to touch and bless the
earth: Witztum calls the city ''the umbili-
I followed Rajinder into the bedroom, and the terror was
gone, an open door now shut, and again I felt nothing, as if I
were marble inside. The two rooms were exactly alike, ex-
cept the bedroom was empty. ''And there, the bed,'' Rajinder
said, placing it with a slight wave of his hand against the
wall across from the window. He spoke slowly and firmly, as
if he were describing what was already there. ''The fridge
we can put right there,' at the foot of the bed. Both were part
of my dowry, Whenever he looked at me, I either said yes or
nodded my head in agreement. We went outside and he
showed me the kitchen and the bathroom, which were con-
nected to the flat but could be entered only through doors
opening onto the roof.
From the roof, a little after eleven, I watched Rajinder
drive away on his scooter. He was going to my parents' flat
in the Old Vegetable Market, where my dowry and our wed-
ding gifts were stored. I had nothing to do while he was
gone, so I wandered in and out of the flat and around the
roof. Defense Colony was composed of rows of pale two- or
three-story buildings. A small park, edged with eucalyptus
trees, was behind our house.
Rajinder returned two hours later with his elder brother,
Ashok, and a yellow van. It took three trips to bring the TV
the sofa, the fridge, the mixer, the steel plates, and my clothes.
Each time they left, I wanted them never to return. Whenever
they pulled up outside, Ashok pressed the horn, which played
''Jingle Bells.'' I was frightened by Ashok, because, with his
handlebar moustache and muscular forearms, he reminded me
of my father's brothers, who, my mother claimed, beat their
wives. Listening to his curses drift out of the stairwell each
time he bumped against a wall while maneuvering the sofa,
TV. and fridge up the stairs,I felt ashamed, as if he were curs-
ing the dowry and, through it, me.
On the first trip they brought back two suitcases that my
mother had packed with my clothes. I was cold, and when
they left, I changed in the bedroom. My hands were trem-
bling by then, and each time I swallowed, I felt a sharp pain
in my throat that made my eyes water. Standing there in the
room gray with dust, the light like cold, clear water, I felt sad
and lonely and excited at being naked in an empty room in a
place where no one knew me. I put on a sylvar kamij, but
even completely covered by the big shirt and pants, I was
cold. I added a sweater and socks, but the cold had slipped
under my skin and lingered beneath my fingernails.
Rajinder did not appear to notice I had changed. I swept
the rooms while the men were gone, and stacked the
kitchen shelves with the steel plates, saucers, and spoons
that had come as gifts, Rajinder and Ashok brought all the
gifts except the bed, which was too big for them. It was
raised to the roof by pulleys the next day. They were able
to bring up the mattress, though, and the sight of it made
me happy, for I knew I would fall asleep easily and that an-
other eight hours would pass.
We did not eat lunch, but in the evening I made rotis and
lentils on a kerosene stove. The kitchen had no light bulb, and
I had only the stove's blue flame to see by. The icy wind
swirled around my feet. Nearly thirty years later I can still re-
member that wind. I could eat only one roti, while Rajinder
and Ashok had six each. We sat in the living room, and they
spoke loudly of their family's farm, gasoline prices, politics in
Haryana, and Indira Gandhi's government. I spoke once, say-
ing that I liked Indira Gandhi, and Ashok said that was be-
cause I was a Delhi woman who wanted to see women in
power. My throat hurt and I felt as if I were breathing steam.
Ashok left after dinner, and Rajinder and I were truly alone
for the first time since our marriage. Our voices were so re-
spectful, we might have been in mourning. He took me silent-
ly in the bedroom, on the mattress beneath the window with
the full moon peering in. When it was over and Rajinder was
sleeping, I lifted myself on an elbow to look at him. I felt
somehow that I could look at him more easily while he was
asleep.I would not be nervous, trying to hide my scrutiny, and
if the panic came,I could just hold on until it passed.I thought
that ifI could see him properly just once,I would no longer be
frightened;I would know what kind of a man he was and what
the future held. But the narrow mouth and the stiff, straight
way he slept, with his arms folded across his chest, said one
thing, and the long, dark eyelashes denied it. I stared at him
until he started flickering, and then I closed my eyes.
[iRrE onms =e wbn owr r=rm+o4w4
u,Idid not think we would marry. The neutrality of
Rajinder's features, across the restaurant table from me, re-
assured me that we would not meet after that dinner. It was
not that I expected to marry someone particularly handsome.
II was neither pretty nor talented, and my family was not rich.
But I could not imagine spending my life with someone so
anonymous. If asked, I would have been unable to tell what
kind of man I wanted to marry, whether he should be hand-
some and funny. I was not even certain I wanted to marry,
though at times I thought marriage would make me less
lonely, What I wanted was to be with someone who could
make me different, someone other than the person I was.
Rajinder did not appear to be such a man, and although
the fact that we were meeting meant that our families ap-
proved of each other, I still felt safe. Twice before, my par-
can solve problems. But once you get into things like
crime, welfare, and education, you're trying to change hu-
man behavior, and that's much tougher to do. The New
Deal was small potatoes compared to most of this stuff,''
''Several things happen when the government gets into
these areas,' says James Q. Wilson, a professor of manage-
ment and public policy at the University of California at Los
Angeles. ''First, no one really knows how to solve these
problems. Second, the public itself is deeply conflicted about
most of these issues; you rarely have a consensus from
which to act. Third, these issues tend to be so complex that
they overwhelm the process. And finally, when these mea-
sures fail to do much to solve something like crime-which
is what inevitably happens--they greatly reinforce the gen-
eral disillusionment with government. There's something to
be said for sticking with what you know how to do,''
During that legislative blizzard Congress was no longer
just distributing money or dealing with problems in discrete
areas (how to regulate the airwaves, or how to provide a sup-
plemental income to senior citizens), and the grand problems
it confronted, like poverty and crime, seemed to require a
variety of coordinated strategies. ''That was a key mistake,''
Theodore Lowi says. ''Health and welfare are not holistic
things; they're a collection of problems. The bills collapse
of their own weight.'' Such bills also tend to be so elaborate
that voters have difficulty understanding them-which
means, at a minimum, that opponents have an easy time rais-
ing fears about them. Unsurprisingly, the public becomes
more engaged when Congress is debating a seemingly
straightforward issue like the Gulf War, in which voters can
understand what is at stake.
Nonetheless, over time congressmen on both sides of the
aisle began drafting longer, more comprehensive bills; the
number of pages of law entered into the statute books dur-
ing the relatively uneventful 1991-- 1992 session was two
and a half times the number entered by the 1965-1966
Great Society Congress. With many legislators continually
preoccupied by issues of openness and equal availability of
services, access and due process became legislative focuses.
That translated into greatly increased complexity and bu-
reaucracy, not to mention a drain on the courts as litigants
attempted to enforce their new rights. In 1936 there were
2,355 pages of regulations amplifying federal laws pub-
lished in the Federal Register. By 1969 the number had
risen to 20,464 pages; in the 1990s the register has been av-
eraging about 60,000 pages a year.

health-care debate showed. Still, by the late 1960s the
old model of legislating had begun to fall out of favor, at
least in one respect. The criticism, advanced by Ralph Nad-
er and others, was that administrative agencies such as the
Interstate Commerce Commission and the Federal Commu-
nications Commission inevitably became controlled by the
forces they were supposed to regulate. Moreover, distrust of
authority was expanding along with voting rights, and there
was a corresponding lack of trust in the opinions of experts
vis-ä-vis ''the people.'' As David Schoenbrod, a professor at
New York Law School, has related in Power Without Re-
sponsibility (1993), what followed was a series of congres-
sional statutes (beginning with the Clean Air Act, in 1970),
passed with bipartisan support, that started to abandon the
concept of open-ended delegation to independent agencies.
Instead these laws essentially ordered the agency in question
to take action and gave ''elaborate instructions about the
goals that it should achieve and the procedures for promul-
gating them.'' These instructions often placed administrative
obligations on the states, while Congress took credit for the
benefits of the legislation.
As a result of this legislative model statutes not only be-
came lengthier and more complicated but also began running
up hidden costs, while parochial and elite interests inevitably
asserted their influence with help from both sides of the aisle:
it was Alaska's Republican senator Ted Stevens, after all,

and South Africa.
To better understand the potential of the
South African market, BLACK ENTERPRISE
spent several weeks in South Africa last
October. In addition to speaking to
African-Americans and South Africans in
business and government, BE was also rep-
resented at the Made In USouth Africa
Expo, a Johannesburg-based eshibition of
goods and services attracting over 230
exhibitors. (See sidebar, ''Resources To
Help You Tap Into South African
Markets,'' for details on these and other
programs designed to open up South
African markets to American entrepre-
neurs,)
What we found was that the African-
American presence in South Africa was
striking. There were black corporate exec
utives from AT&T, Duracell and Chrysler
at the Made In USouh Africa Expo. More
than 30 African-American companies paid
up to $7,500 for a booth, lodging and air-
fare with no guarantee of contracts to
attend this event. These included several
BE 100s companies new to the South
African marketplace, Hair care products
manufacturer Luster Products of Chicago
and BET International, a subsidiary of
Washington-based Black Entertainment
T'elevision, which broadcasts programs on
a South African network, were among the
newcomers. There have been joint ven-
tures between major corporations, African-
American investors and black South
Africans, A prominent example is New
Age Beverages Ltd., a joint venture
between Pepsi-Cola International and
Egoli Beverages LP, announced last June.
New Age Beverages is a Pepsi bottling
franchise owned by black South Africans
in partnership with Egoli Beverages lLd., a
consortium that includes prominent
African-Americans, such as BE Publisher
Earl Graves, attorney Johnny Cochran and
actor Danny Glover.
For three African-AAmerican enterprises,
venturing into South Africa has already
begun to bear fruit, The first are corporate
lawyers who put down their torts and
moved to fohannesburg to open a chain of
laundry centers, The next is a veteran
telecommunications company owner
whose appraisal of South Africa's emerging
black business class led him to enter the
hot cellular phone industry with a South
African partner, Finally, two New York
But there are also differences in the way
that business is conducted in South Africa
compared with this country, For instance,
Felicia Mabuza-Suttle, the host of the pop-
ular South African talk show, Top Level. is
very familiar with these differences, After
all, Mabuza-Suttle spent 20 years in
America. She advises Americans that they
must learn to build trust in a society that
moves more slowly and makes decisions
more deliberately. For example, she notes
that black South Africans never talk busi-
ness before enquiring about one's health or
family. And as more Americans arrive, they
have to avoid gaining the reputation, as she
puts it, of ''coming over, picking their
brains, then, when they need to form part-
nerships, linking up with whites or some
other non-black South African group.'
concludes Mabuza-Suttle, who is also
executive manager, corporate relations
worldwide, for South African Airways,
Samuel Noinyane agrees, He is chairman
of Odyssey Sports (PPry) Ltd., which con-
trols Nike Corp.'s distribution in southern
Africa, He believes that African-Americans
and black South Africans can prosper
together, but only if ''marriages of mutual
understanding and assistance' are created.
He contends that white South Africans
prefer to work with black South Africans
because they are a known-and malleable,
or so they believe-entity, ''We need to
gain the Afro-American business and tech-
nical knowledge apart from the whites and
then use it on them to get what we want,''
Noinyane emphasizes.
Managing espectations is another critical
factor. Demand for job training in post-
apartheid South Africa is intimidatingly
high. You will be under tremendous pres-
sure-----in the form of angry protests-to
provide training and opportunities for
black South Africans, It is important that
you do not promise more than you can
deliver, and that you make clear how you
intend to integrate South Africans into the
labor and management of your business,

its winemaking. Close to l00 wines are now available in the
U.S. And South Africa's small, independent wineries are
making some of the country's most interesting wines,
One of the first to see the promise in his country's wines
was Jabulani Ntshangase, a black South African wine whole-
sale distributor in New York, Soon after Nelson Mandela's
release, Ntshangase and Andre Shearer, a fellow South
African, who iswhite, formed Cape Classics, an import com-
pany devoted solely to high quality South African wines.
Wih elections came 'euphoria,' says Ntshangase. ''IF we
have a problem now, it's that we represent small wineries
with limited productions, and their wines are selling so well,
we're running out,''
Of South Africa's white wines, the most exceptional is
Sauvignon Blanc. It is, in fact, one of the finest examples of
sively, sees Pinotage as the country's signature wine, ''It's
very appealing, modestly priced and delicious,' he says.
South Africa also makes impressive Shiraz--a firm,
intense, spicy, peppery red wine. Notable labels are those of
Lievland, La Motte and Rust en Vrede. The country also
produces a Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet
Franc. But far more striking are the wines made from a blend
of these red grapes, Most distinguished are Rozendal Farm,
Rubicon of Meerlust, and La Femme Bleu and Trilogy, both
from the Warwick Winery.
Most South African wines range from $5.50 to $25 in price.
with many of the best costing $8 to $14 per bottle. Not bad
for wines that have spent long years waiting in the wings, At

Are you serious about the story of
Cabletron executives bucking the high
executive pay trend? They may only
be paid $52,000, but how many people
own $927 million worth of stock? Their
disgust with out-of-control executive
pay is at the very least hypocritical.
The two are seen as valiant do-gooders
for taking so little pay, yet Mr. Levine
has the ability to write a $70,000 per-
sonal check. On closer examination,
their low pay has less to do with some
noble cause and is more likely linked to
their huge bank balances accumulated
from the sale of $500 million worth of

Rock Bottom was launched five years
ago by Chairman and cEO Frank B.

most advanced player in the race to
build a national chain of brew pubs, a
rush fueled by the soaring popularity
of tiny local microbreweries. After test-
ing out the formula in its original Den-
ver brew pub for two years, the compa-
ny began expanding in 1998. Now Day,

18 restaurants by the end of 1996.
Rock Bottom has thrived because,

firsthand that quality service pays off in
the restaurant business. Rock Bottom
employees rely on teamwork, run each
other's orders to tables, share grunt
work, and rotate undesirable shifts.

because of several crucial architectural
features. It was designed to be both a
client and a server-in peer and client/
server networking schemata-and is
both a NOS (network operating system)
and an applications platform, Rt was also
written to ride on a HAL (hardware ab-
straction layer), which hides the specifics
of the machine behind a generalized in-
terface. Because of HAL, NT has been
successfully ported to a variety of sys-
tems buiht on x86, Alpha, PowerfC, and
Mips processors. NT also supports SMP
if it is effectively solved, it won't matter to
users whether they are attached to a host,
a server, or a network of PCs.
':What you want is to be able to plug
into a single wire and see a consistent set
of services,' says Firmage.''NDS [he Net-
Ware Directory Service in release 4,x,
which provides for a single network log-in]
was a first step; next we want to provide a
single image of the network file system.''
Volumes would thus be completely logical
and locationless, so you could map to any
resource on the network.
Of course, a single system image does
not imply that all or even any of the pro-
grams you use are executing on a central
server using the shared-logic model of
mainframes and minicomputers. But sig-
nificant parts of a distributed application
could be executing on a central system,
depending on such factors as the location
of the target data, network load balancing,
or the capabilities of the central machine
(i,e., if it is optimized for ad hoc queries,
floating-point calculations, or rendering).
The Cost of Data
One of the main factors encouraging dis-
tributed computing is the cost of data com-
munications, in terms of both performance
communications can promote either cen-
tralization or decentralization. (The for-
mer, because it reduces the penalty of ac-
cessing shared data the latter, because it
makes distributing data faster and less ex-
pensive.) But bandwidth isn't the only fac-
tor. Latency is also a key performance is-
sue. ''The speed of access to disks is much
better-on the order of milliseconds-if
you're closer, compared to hundreds of
milliseconds or more if you go out across
the network,'' he says, Certain classes of
problems have an ''affinity'' for data and
are thus better addressed on a central com-
puter.
Centralization doesn't imply using tra-
ditional mainframes; you can build net-
works around fault-tolerant Unix machines
or NetFrame superservers. Vendors of such
mainframe-replacement systems normally
sing the praises of centralization. ''Tan-
dem has been able to do distributed pro-
cessing forever, with a single system image
across hundreds of processors,'' says
Edwards. ''But people still choose to cen-
tralize because of security and easier sys-
tem management.'' And, she adds, cen-
tralized systems reduce MIS staffing needs
compared to setups that require a system
administrator in every office.
''It's easier to distribute applications
rather than data,' Amdahl says. He adds
that distributed data is harder to control,
and you have to administer tricky data-
base tasks, such as replication and ver-
sioning. ''The last thing IS people want to
do,'' Amdahl says, ''is to partition data
across more than one machine.'' What hap-
pens if the network breaks and parts of the
tutorials on how to create the transitions
with a selection of digital-editing software.
Capture Coniicts
To digitize our taped demonstrations, we
first used the Orchid Videola Premium.
After trying almost every configuration
combination imaginable, we got the video
capture working-or so we thought. When
we dumped the captured clip into Adobe
Premiere (our editing software), the video
was consecutive frames of solid pink.
Orchid technical support came up with
a solution: Go into Gateway's BIOS setup
and disable BIOS shadowing. That trick
let us capture some excellent video clips
using Orchid's Motion JPEG compression
(an optional daughtercard is required for
M-IPEG).
Unfortunately, the Videola requires a
VGA feature connector, which limits your
desktop resolution to 640 by 480 pixels.
(In theory, you should be able to get up to
an 800- by 600-pixel resolution desktop,
but we never got stable output at the higher
resolution.) Adobe Premiere and other dig-
ital video editors present a full desktop
with an assortment of tool palettes and
windows. You also must work with a time
line packed with video strips, transition
effects, and audio waveforms. It's simply
too much interface for anything less than a
1024- by 768-pixel resolution desktop.
Many alternatives can replace the fea-
ture-connectors (faster local-bus architec-
tures such as PCI [Peripheral Component
Interconnect], better compression schemes,
integrated chips that combine Windows
acceleration with motion-video support,
and architectural solutions such as VESA
Media Channel). At this point, we don't
recommend a feature-connector solution.
The best answer is a turnkey solution.
We solicited Smart and Friendly's MPEG
Creation Station, a well-conceived bun-
dle of products that comprises all the pieces
you'llneed to generate MPEG titles. Smart
and Friendly offers the MPEG Creation
Station as a turnkey system, but when we
started our project, the components were
only available separately. That's a lot of
stuff to get working in a single PC.
We ran into problems trying to get the
Fast Movie Machine to work (the capture
component of the MPEG Creation Sta-
tion). The Movie Machine supports an
optional Motion-JPEG board that occu-
pies its own slot, interrupt, and address
space. When we first installed it, the
motion-video input displayed on screen,
but it wasn't aligned in the capture win-
dow. When we tried to load the alignment
controls, we were unceremoniously

says the display shortages that have de-
layed orders for some ThinkPads aren't a
factor for the 701C, thanks in part to out-
sourcing from Sharp.
The 701C comes with audio and tele-
phony features similar to those of the larg-
er and faster 755C, but because of its -lid-
ing keyboard, the 701C doesn't have space
for a CD-ROM drive. The 701C's modem
isn't upgradable from 14.4 Kbps. With a
256-color palette, the 701C doesn't have
the 755C's more sophisticated graphics
system (65,536 colors at VGA resolutions).
Finally, the 701C can't capture or output
broadcast-standard video.
The 701C does, however, shine among
portables for pleasantness to use and for
flat-out coolness. Cha-chunk may soon

CHESS CONGRESSäse4s3R

THE TOURNAMENT BEGAN AMID
threats of severe thunderstorms and tor-
nadoes. The youngest player, Thomas
Avery (6) from Miami, Florida, stormed
in to play chess. With a shark through his
hat, he played like GM Walter Browne
with an intensity one could not only see
but feel. After winning trophies in the
Blitz and Bughouse tournaments, he won
the eight-and-under section with a per-
fect score.
The tournament, held at the Marriott
Hotel in Huntsville, Alabama, had close
to 150 players from 11 different states. At
least one player from each state won a
trophy. The chief tournament director
was Frank Camaratta. He was assisted by
Kenneth Sloan, Jack Mallory, Harry
Sabine, Bill Melvin, Bill Savoie, John
Schweinsberg, Philip Creel, James Reed-
er, Kyle Therrell and Dick Rhea
The tournament was organized by Wal-
ter and Dorothy Schaetzle with the help
of numerous volunteers including James
and Barbara Reeder, Mary Francis
Thomas, Michael Schaetzle, James
Schaetzle, Bill Melvin and many others.
Amanda Newsom, a sixth-grade student,
designed the logo used on the tourna-
ment program and the T-shirt. The tSCF
was represented by President Denis
Barry and his lovely wife, Doris and
Steve Miller.
Many players made the 100-yard walk
to the U.S. Space and Rocket Center for
an update on our space program. The
hotel provided outstanding service with
a ''fast food bar at fast food prices'' just
outside the playing area. Many took
advantage of the breakfast bar with spe-
cial prices for chessplayers.
Richard Benjamin, a life master from
Atlanta, Georgia, gave a regular simulta-

rell, a life master from Birmingham, Ala-
Dama, gave a clock simultaneous on
Sunday night.

in Rhode Island, was ranked 35th in the
nation with a rating of 2553 at the time of
this game. Undaunted, Curdo played
sharply from the beginning, sacking a
pawn early for open lines, then giving up
his queen in a pretty combination that
eventually left him up a double Exchange

Dough-Cutting Hints
I enjoyed your recipe for
empanadas in the August 1994
issue. My wife, who just returned
from a year-long assignment with
the US Air Force in Honduras,
declared them equal to any that
she had eaten there. I have a cou-
ple of comments, however. Maybe
I just haven't figured out how to
roll the dough for the crust thin
enough, but it took three crust
recipes to use up the filling! (I
turned this to my advantage,
though, because I was able to
make some snack-sized
empanadas on short notice for a
Christmas party I was invited to).
My other comment concerns cut-
ting out the ''blanks'' for the
empanadas. The recipe calls for

Clyde suddenly raised his two
left legs, rolled over onto his right
side and spilled me on the ground
with a ''whump.'' Clyde laughed
his camel laugh. It was a sound I
would come to know well,
Although I had crossed the Great
Indian Desert on camelback, and
thought myself quite the camelteer,
Clyde was out to teach me other-
wise. ''Clyde is very bad some-
times,' Amdi said. ''I think we will
get rid of him soon.'' It couldn't

I did invite my friends from the
city, and the camel's foot stew was
very rich-tasting and cooked with a
deliciously spicy Bohar by Amdi's
mother. The butcher did come to
the feast and several of the testimo-
nials to his strength were present
with him. I took even more of the
stew. We ate six different dishes of
camel, including vegetables cooked
in camel stock. After dinner we
shared a hookah and sweet mint
tea.
The evening grew late, and as we
prepared to depart, Amdi, express-
ing Arab hospitality, said, ''This is

And this is your second home. You

''I hope my second family won't

''Oh, you won't have to think

''No. Except how he made you

AYAM LEMAK (CHICKEN
COOKED IN SPICY COCONUT
MILK GRAVY)
We often ate chicken while in
Malaysia, not just because it's a sta-
ple of our diet back home, but
because we knew it would be fresh.
The live caged chickens we saw at
the daytime Central Market, where
the townspeople shopped, often
became the main course at Night
Market a few hours later.
1 large onion, diced
3 fresh red chiles, such as serrano
or cayenne, stems and seeds
removed, finely chopped
1 tablespoon grated lemon rind
2 teaspoons grated ginger
3 to 4 tablespoons vegetable oil
1% teaspoons ground turmeric
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 3-pound chicken, cut in
serving pieces
3 cups unsweetened coconut milk
1 cup water
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
Place the onion, chiles, lemon
rind, ginger and 1 tablespoon oil in
a blender or food processor and
puree until a thick paste is formed.
Add the turmeric and black pepper
and process for an additional
minute. Spread the paste mixture
on the chicken pieces until well-
coated.
Combine the remaining oil with
any remaining blender mixture and
saute, stirring constantly, for 15
minutes. Add the chicken and fry,
turning often, for another 15 min-
utes or until chicken is well-
browned. Add the coconut milk,
water and basil and simmer, uncov-
ered, until chicken is completely
cooked, adding additional water if
needed.
to print for reliable news. It did loosen up in
1976 hllowing TV advertising)and increased
entertainment programs in 198-4, but it was
not until 1992 that real changes occurred. A
bold expatriate businessman, Subhash
Chandra, launched the first Hindi-language
satellite network, Zee TV,whose taped pro-
grams, though made in India, were shipped
to Hong Kong, then beamed by satellite not
only back to ndia but to most of the Mid-
dle East as well. The ndian Telegraph Act,
which banned unauthorized ground-to-
ground transmissions within India, had
been leapfrogged by new technology.
The satellite network prompted ad
agencies to churn out 'TV spots boosting
everything from whisky to laptops and
detergents, Zee TV became, overnight, a
runaway success: MIurdoch promptly
acquired a 50 percent stake and launched
two more satellite channels out of Hong
Kong. Other networks followed, beaming
their signals in English, Hindi, Telugu,
Tmil and Bengali, They were joined by
the BBC. Cable distribution and pay-IV
companies began signing up subscribers
in all major towns, with the government
turning a blind eye.
I December 199-4, Zee TV began its
twin film channel, capitalizing on the stag-
gering loyalty of its fns: 'The post office in
Worli District, near Zee TVk cramped
Bombay headquarters, has hired 30 extra
postal workers to cope with the 350,000
posteards arriving daily. And Zee 'TV
CEO Digviiay Singh is launching a Zee
'TV cable network designed for Indian
households in Britain and hopes to be
operating in the U.S. soon.
All told, some 30 satellite channels now
beam programs into Indian homes through-
out Asia and most of the Middle East. By
1997 esperts predict, there will be more than
100 satellite channels, Costs will drop when
the Indian Telegraph Act is repealed and
programs no longer have to be bounced off
transponders from outside India.
In response, DD has overhauled its pro-
gramming. DD Metro, a brash entertain-
ment channel (and carbon copy of MTV),
has become hugely popular. DDl, the for-
mer government monopoly, now offers
popular films, soaps, and quiz and game
shows; from time to time it tackles con-
troversial topics, even airing a recent debate
titled ''WWhatk WWrong with Doordarshan?''
Though the two DD channels are more
accessible, requiring neither dishes nor
cable fees, and still have about 70 percent of
the espanded 'TVadvertising market, DDk
civil-servant managers recognize their for-
midable competition. Zee TVs Aap Ki
Aldalat (hur Own Court), in which ex-
newspaper editor Rajat Sharma grills
politicians before a delighted live audience,
has 100 million viewers, The program is
revolutionizing Indias notoriously corrupt
political scene.''Politicians now think twice
before making demagogic promises,' says
Sharma. Combining the smiling charm of
a Charlie Rose with the inquisitorial skill of
a Mile Wllace, he has no qualms about ask-
ing tough personal questions, admitting he
has learned a lot from watching 60 3iuutes,
Sharmas huge success has compelled
politicians to hire ad agencies to school
them in how to face the camera.
TV5 impact on Indian society is still
largely unknown, But the proliferation of
''Hinglish' channels, with video jockeys
openly copying the mannerisms of their
MTVmentors, has accelerated the gener-
ation gap. ''Theres a new language emerg-
ing on television,' says sociologist Ashis
Nandy, ''and its largely gibberish to older
people'' Overtly sexual scenes on TV not
only upset traditionalists but have troubled
some adolescents brought up in puritanical
family environments, TV has also triggered
a new crime wave, but in an overwhelmingly
Indian context: ''There have been a fright-
ening number of instances where elderly
people living alone have been murdered
by greedy servants or local oddjobsmen
solely to lay hands on their TV sets or their
VCRs,'says Nandy.''I expect an enormous
rise in crime as Indias increasingly uproot-
ed underclass, that has not profited from the
boom, watches soaps where everyone lives
like millionaires'' Despite the exposure to
new lifestyles, he says, Indian family rela-
tionships remain strong. ''We Indians
already live in a multicultural society, and
are assimilating what we watch as just
another alien culture to be observed, but not
necessarily followed''
And in the state of Goa, one of Nandys
students discovered that most of those he
polled assume that cops-and-robbers
soaps, whether imported or Indian-made,
are true-life documentaries extolling the
work of the police. And the power of TV
advertising has had unexpected repercus-
sions, Whenever spots show actors in
white coats promoting pharmaceutical
goods, an overwhelming majority assumes
that these are real doctors imparting not
blurbs, but professional advice that should
not be ignored.

After Michelangelo scrapped Sangallos
design, his own work was altered to com-
promise the Greek-cross plan (already
begun by Bramante and advanced by San-
gallo) with a long nave. Carlo Maderno, by
adding the nave and western facade, dis-
guised the scale of the church from the out-
side: Close to the facade, one cannot even see
the far-off dome. The church is seen in its
parts, not as a whole.
For a long time, people have accepted
Michelangelos strictures on the Sangallo
model. Michelangelo had been frustrated by
Sangallos papal commissions, and he reject-
ed the plans for St. Peters with contempt.
But scholarship devoted to the Sangallo
model during its restoration has uncovered
some forgotten merits of its design.
Michelangelo criticized the model for being
too dark in its interior. He said Romes
lowlifes would lurk in its dim crannies. But
Sangallo conceived it as a mausoleum, the
funerary monument for St. Peter, and he
angled l6 of his tunneled windows to throw
rays of light on the tomb area. The exteri-
or of the church he patterned after classical
mausoleums-those of Augustus and
Hadrian. Like them, it had colonnades and
tiered statues around the ''mound'' on top (a
low dome). Even the spires in front, criticized
as Gothic elements intruding upon a clas-
sical design, were taken from an Etruscan
tomb of Porsena) described by Pliny.
Michelangelos plan was also for a mau-
soleum, but of a very different sort. He
began his work destined for St. Peters
under Pope Julius II, who wanted a huge
funerary monument to himself. This
became one of Michelangelos great doomed

5ig remodeling projects often start casually-the dishwasher breaks
iidown, and you notice the cabinets are looking old, or you're wiping
moisture from a foundation wall and decide its time to refinish the
basement to add some living space to the house. But what starts almost
unintentionally just as often ends up with a homeowner who is feeling liter-
ally homicidal about contractors. To get the job done right, you've got to be
anything but casual, because this is one big 'homework'' assignment.
First, unless you're a dedicated DlYer with a lot of free time, chances are
you're going to hire a contractor or designer. You'll find yourself alternating
between extremes-happy anticipation of a beautiful new master bedroom
suite or a spacious new family room and dread about the horrific images
you've heard from friends: the ones about remodelers who disappeared
without finishing the roof. Or damaged the plumbing lines. Or messed up
the materials orders and then took si months to finish a one-month job.
Unfortunately, any remodeling job, big or small, can turn into a genuine
nightmare of lies, recriminations, shoddy work, outrageous cost overruns
and even outright fraud. But its not the typical scenario, and it certainly
doesn't have to happen to you. Its up to you to make sure it doesn't, and
you've got plenty of tools at hand to do so.
Ultimately, you're going to make a very personal decision that will tem-
porarily disrupt your life. 'We're camping out in your home,'' says Sandy
McAdams, CGR, vice president of the McAdams Co., a full-service residen-
tial remodeling contractor in Kirkland, Wash. McAdams is active in the
Remodelors@ Council of the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB).
Because the working relationship will be fairly intimate, you want to be sure
you and the contractor are on the same wavelength. Cameron Snyder, CKD,
president of Kitchen Concepts, a kitchenlbath designer-dealer in Norwell,
Mass., calls it a ''kind of synergy. Meet with the designer and ask yourself
'does this designer understand me?','' says Snyder, who is the incoming
president of the National Kitchen & Bath Association (NKBA).
Responsible remodelers are well aware of their industry's image prob-
lems. Its to the industrys advantage to deliver a qualty job on time, within
budget, and with a minimum of problems. 'That will benefit me in the long
run,' says Polly Evans, CR, CKD, president of Case Design/Remodeling, a
full-service designlbuild company with offices in Falls Church, Va. and
Bethesda, Md. ''It means I satisfied you; you're going to be happy, and
you're going to recommend me,'' says Evans, who is also immediate past
president of the National Association of the Remodeling Industry (NARl).
ARMNG YOURSELF WITH INFORMATION
In most remodeling j0bs, you're concerned with both function and appear-
ance-your goal at the end of the project is to have something that works
for you and looks terrific. But you've got to do your homework.
Good information is your best resource and your best protection. Its
widely and readily available. Relevant government agencies, industry trade
associations, and manufacturers are all important sources of information on
permits and codes, hiring remodelers, products, and design ideas. (See
''Where to Find Help'' below and the 'Credentials'' box.) Magazines are qood
sources for checking out product features and design trends. Manufacturers
offer consumer literature on their lines and how their products fit into the
projects you may be planning. Pricing information is available in books from
publishers like R.S. Means and Craftsman Book Company.
Put in the research time, and you'll get a hands-on feel for the products
you'll be using. In the process, you'll learn enough to ask the right questions
and judge workmanship. You'll also get a good sense of what things cost.
This will help you sort out your budget and work out your financing before
you even start interviewing remodelers. You should be prepared from the
start to discuss your cost tange and budget limits.
Depending on the job you're planning and where you live, you should
also check out local building-code requirements. Additions to the structure,
plumbing and sewer-line connections, and electrical work are just some of
the elements that usually involve code compliance. Find out what the
requirements are, and who needs to obtain the permit--this is usually
something you'll want your contractor to do.
You'll also be making decisions about the professionals you need to
hire. Many designers and contractors do a mi of residential and commer-
cial work, but they tend to specialize in one or the other. Homeowners
should go with firms emphasizing residential, since they're likely to be more
familiar with the ins and outs of the home and its needs. And you'll reduce
the chance that they'll give priority to bigger, more demanding, and more
profitable commercial jobs.
lf your job involves space planning and interior design, you may want to
opt for professionals with those competencies. Room additions and large-
scale structural modifications that require blueprints and construction draw-
ings might require you to work with an architect.
J0bs requiring design as well as construction and installation expertise
might call for a full-service designlbuild company. They handle jobs anging
from garages to room additions to repaneling the library. Kitchenlbath
designers and dealers handle design and installation for those rooms, and
increasingly, for the other-room jobs many homeowners are now doing. If
you're doing insulation, electrical, plumbing or other non-design related
work, you should be looking at subcontractors and contractors in those spe-
cialties. This is likely to be the case with roofing and siding, as well.
ln addition to independent designers and contractors, you may want to
touch base with some of the national home centers. They're adding indus-
try-certified people to their staffs and offering installation referrals as well.
''Most dissatisfaction comes from poor planning,'' says Allen Inlow,
executive vice president of the National Association of Plumbing-Heating-
Cooling Contractors (NAPHCC), a contractor trade association. 'f you can
sit down and talk with the contractor from the start, you can avoid delays
and extra costs.''
Putting in this time and effort up-front can make the difference between
happiness and misery, both while the job is going on and when it is finished.
But too few people follow through on the information. ''This is a major
investment,' Snyder says, 'and consumers don't check enough.'
CHOOSING YOUR REMODELER
Visit showrooms, home centers, and lumberyards while you're reviewing the
written material you'll be collecting. Its a good way to start talking with
designers and to see the products in person. Get remodelers' names from
people who've gone through it-friends, family, or business associates.
Word-of-mouth is the best reference; contractors who get most of their
business this way are very likely the ones you'll want most to talk to. If you
don't know someone who's recently completed the kind of job you'll be
doing, names from the professional associations and their local chapters are
a better bet than the phone book.
If you've used remodelers before for other jobs, ask them to recom-
mend subcontractors and specialists in the projact you're now planning.
Home centers and lumberyards are another source. They don't generally
recommend individual contractors, but they do have lists, and they're not
g0Ing to recommend people they haven't checked out. You might also try
driving through your neighborhood and looking for contractor names on
signs in front of homes with current jobs underway.
Hf the same names keep coming up, or if certain remodelers get espe-
cially strong recommendations, they're the ones to interview first. Right
from the start, reject anyone who shows up for a first visit in dirty work
boots and a messy truck. High-pressure sales tactics are another turn-off,
along with any problems in verifying the contractor's street address, license
number or insurance.
Check The Remodelers Background, In addition, be sure you get sat-
isfactory answers to several important questions. Is the contractor in com-
pliance with existing licensing requirements for his or her trade? Does he or
she carry general liability insurance and workers' comp? These factor into
the kind of protection you have if the job isn't completed or if there's an acci-
dent while work is underway.
A good remodeler will have his or her license numbers and insurance
certificates ready to show you and will be happy to have you verify them.
''Anybody reputable would want you to check everything,' Snyder says. At
least 38 states now have laws requiring conttactors andlor designers to be
licensed. Many localities have their own requirements, regardless of state-
level laws. Take the time to see what kind of licensing your state or town
has, and you'll be aware of what protection it may afford you and how
strongly officials enforce iit.
ln some jurisdictions, contractors can get a license just by paying a fee
or registering. Others states or areas require examinations, demonstrations
of financial stability, and/or proof of insurance and workers'-comp coverage.
Some licensing laws have restitution funds and provisions for compensating
consumers who can show proof of failure to complete the job.''You have to
must give you written notice that you have three days to cancel
a signed contract without penalty. If the contractor fails to pro-
vide you with this notification, take it as a deal-breaking warning
sign and look for a new contractor.
Think through all the things related to the job, as well as the
work you set out to do. It will cost less to do it all at once than
to come back a year later and add it on. ''Do the homework,''
Cameron Snyder says. In the kitchen, ''Look for cabinets you
like,'' Don't just think cooktop, for example, he continues-
think ''four or si-burner cooktop. Come up with a wish list of
everything you've always wanted in your kitchen. Then priori-
tize your list''
Talking to a contractor about a driveway? Discuss the kind
of base you'll use, Evans says. On exterior jobs like siding and
roofing, McAdams says, make sure the materials are visually
compatible with the house. Such jobs are also the right time to
upgrade your insulation, she adds.
A bathroom remodel might be the time to inspect all your
home's plumbing, suggests lnlow. 'Ask the contractor to take
a look at the pipes.'' Over the years, qalvanized steel and other
plplng used in older homes run a serious risk of developing
Cl0gged arteries from sediment deposits and narrowing of the
channel, he notes.
DEVELOPNG A REALISTIC BJDGET
Getting ready and on the job, working with the designer or
contractor calls for regular, two-way communication-and
two-way trust. 'Once you've made the decision to hire a con-
tractor, I'd hope you'd trust that decision and have confidence
in the person you've hired,'' McAdams says. 'We want to hear
what you expect from us.''
That begins with cost questions. 'The budget is the first
thing to zero in on-or any job,'' Evans says. 'You have to
)e able to tell the person you're working with how much you
)lan to spend.'' Epect that to be one of the designer's first
juestions. Remodelers are well aware that it's one that
nakes consumers nervous.''A lot of customers will be reluc-
ant to give it because they think the designer will spend it
dl,' Snyder acknowledges. But, 'A good firm will request a
udget figure. The design for a $30,000 job will be different
rom a design for a $10,000 job,'' he notes.
Your budget is the starting point for discussions about balancing design
choices and deciding on product selection. 'l not only need your budget, but
l need your list of priorities,'' Polly Evans says. 'That's how l can specify
quality products to give you as much of your wish list as l can.''
Snyder emphasizes that 'lts the designer's responsibility to draw infor-
mation from the customer that the customer might not even think is impor-
tant. Consumers should expect a lot of time and a lot of meetings.'' Typically
in a kitchen job, the designer will explain your product choices, qoing over
differences in materials and pricing. 'He should make design recommenda-
tions and lighting recommendations,'' Snyder says, adding that key details
like lighting are something consumers tend to overlook.
Up front, says McAdams, 'If the contractor is doing his job, he will let
you know the unexpected can happen.'' Contractors should also be very
clear on what they need from you, and on what schedule. If you're going to
be choosing materials like wallpaper or deciding on whether to include insu-
lation in a siding job, he or she should set up a reasonable schedule that
gives you time to make your choices.
Your part in this is just as important. If you're going to buy some of the
products used in a kitchen remodel on your own, for example, tell the per-
SOn you're hiring. Make sure the designer knows of any strong preferences
yOu may have about the way things will work or how they will look.
Remember: Something will go wrong during the job. You can bet on it,
The cabinets won't arrive on time. Or there'll be termites in the wall where
you're putting on a room addition. You might decide when you see t qoing
in that you can't stand the range hood you chose. Whatever it is, if you've
taken the time to protect yourself and put the right measures in place, it
shouldn't become a major crisis. Thats the bottom line.
WHERE TO FIND HELP

and design trade associations today. There's no way to list them all; we've

tions or because of the specialties involved.

Perhaps the next-greatest impact on
the resale value of a used car or truck is
the current cost of a new version of the
same or a similar vehicle. One way to
ensure a good resale value is to ''buy a
vehicle in a class where prices will rise
dramatically in the future,' says George
Peterson, automotive analyst and presi-
dent of Auto Pacific Group Inc. When
new-car prices are on the upswing, it
helps prop up the values of used vehi-
cles. Strong market demand, coupled

Six Flags Houston, guests enter an eerie
Gotham City movie set including the
Batcave, Arctic Park and Cold Storage.
Then they board a coaster that whips
them through a 360-degree loop and a
tunnel with special visual effects. This
park has nine other coasters, including
the new indoor Mayan Mindbender
enclosed in ''an ancient temple''
Other parks emphasize showtime. At
Opryland USA in Nashville, Tenn., you
can wander among a string of auditori-
ums and outdoor pavilions that feature
everything from country music and
Broadway revues to heartfelt gospel
music, then attend a performance of the
Grand Ole Opry next door and go for a
dinner cruise on the General Jackson
showboat (yes, with yet another show).
''Paramount on Ice Legends'' at
Paramount's Kings Island, near
Cincinnati, combines live skating action
with motion-picture oldies. At Knott's
Camp Snoopy, the indoor theme park in
the Mall of America, Bloomington,
Minn., guests can attend musical revues
at the Playhouse Theater, a Wilderness
Wildlife Show and music shows on the
Northwood Stage-all in a landscaped
setting with 400 trees and 30,000 plants
that recreate Minnesota's North Woods.
as adults. Others use height, charging
every child 48 inches or taller the full
adult price.
But there are ways to reduce your
costs, ''Anyone who pays full admission
at a park today has money to burn,' says
one park marketing executive, speaking
off the record. ''Most parks have to offer
coupons or other discount deals to keep
people coming through those turnstyles,
especially during slow periods.'' Here
are a few of the deals out there:
Going to the park for two or more
days? Most parks offer discounts for
consecutive-day tickets-Or lower-
priced dual-tickets if they are associated
with a water park or other attraction. For
frequent visitors, a season pass can be a
great moneysaver. Almost all parks offer
discounts to seniors. Many offer dis-
counts to active and retired military per-
sonnel and their families, handicapped
visitors, teachers, students, members of
various organizations including AARP
(American Association of Retired
Persons), other senior organizations,
AA A (the American Automobile
Association), motor and travel clubs,
local residents who live in certain zip-
code areas in cities around the park,
teachers, community groups-t0 name
just a few. To claim these discounts you
often must follow certain procedures set
by the individual parks, such as showing
appropriate identification or getting

OPERATING ON NESTED
RELATIONS
If relation R has a column C that con-
tains numbers, I can apply opera-
tors such as ''-4- / ''-- '' ''GU'' and so
on to values from that column. It's
important to understand, however,
that-conceptually, at least-the
DDBMS doesn't know what it means,
for example, to add two numbers
together; what it does know is how
to invoke a built-in function called
''-4'' that can perform that operation
on its behalf.
In exactly the same way, if re-
lation R has a column C that con-
tains relations, I can apply opera-
tors to values from that column, and
the DBMS will simply invoke the
appropriate built-in functions to
perform the requested operations.
But the operators that I want to ap-
ply to values in that column are
(of course) things such as restrict,
project, and so on,... In other words,
''invoking the appropriate built-in
functions'' will effectively be just a
recursive call on (certain portions of)
the DBMS itself.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
Well, I've now introduced the basic
idea of nested relations and shown
how they can be used to avoid the
need for outer join. Next month, Il1
consider other applications of the
nestedl relation idea. For now, let me
leave you with this month's ''puzzle
corner'' problem.I mentioned earlier
that ''NF' relations'' require explict
MST and ST operations for con-
verting between a relation's nested
and unnested forms. In outline, those
operators work as follows:
D Given a relation and a set
of columns, NEST returns a corre-
sponding nested relation. For ex-
ample, nesting the usual suppliers
relation ''along'' Sn, SAME, and SA-
TUS yields a nestedd relation contain-
ing three rows, one for each of the
three CIIY values (ILondon, Paris, and
Athens); each of these rows con-
tains the appropriate city name and
a relation with heading St, SNAME,
SIATUS ], representing the suppliers
in that city. Note: It might help to
point out that if we partition the
columns of relation R into two dis-
joint subsets A and B, nesting R
along B is equivalent to grouping R
by A.
DDUNEST is the opposite of NST,
loosely speaking-though if we un-
nest R ''along'' some set of columns
and then nest the result ''along''
those same columns again, we don't
necessarily get back to R!
Give an example to show that
-as just indicated-unnesting in
this sense isn't necessarily reversible.
Can you find a set of conditions
under which the unnesting is nec-
essarily reversible?

functions and minimize their pro-
cessing. Variants of this principle are
the ''80/20 rule'' (focus on that 20
percent of the problem that will re-
turn 80 percent of the benefits) and
the ''bottleneck rule'' (always work
on the biggest bottleneck). When
we are designing software, this prin-
ciple reminds us to focus our de-
sign efforts on the most perfor-
mance-critical components of the
highest priority, highest volume,
most performance-critical applica-
tions. This rule is particularly useful
in a distributed environment, since
we have more components to think
about.
When applying this rule to
tuning a distributed system, the prob-
lem lies in finding out where the
largest bottleneck is-a topic we'll
discuss later when we address the
Instrumentation Principle. But the
Centering Principle also reminds us
that we must first know which appli-
cations are performance critical and
zuhich system components will be the
most heavily exercised. To answer
these questions, we should make
sure we collect this information dur-
ing the planning and analysis stages
of the development process. Then,
performance modeling techniques
can help us identify critical applica-
tion and system components.
If we don't apply the Center-
ing Principle to everything we do,
we could waste a lot of effort re-
fining the design of components
that are rarely used or not perfor-
mance critical.

performance principle is so obvi-
ous that we tend to forget about it.
Another name for it might be ''the
shouldn't stop with function; they
should also record the relationship
of the application's different com-
ponents to business variables such
as the number of customers need-
ing certain types of service and the
expected frequencies of these busi-
ness activities. Unless we capture
these kinds of metrics during anal-
ySis, we can't expect to make in-
formed design decisions later in the
development process.

work. Smith's princi-
ple states, ''Create actions, functions,
and results that are 'close' to phys-
ical resources''; Shasha's ''render
onto server what is due onto serv-
er'' embodies the same thought. The
point is that we will receive the best
performance when the physical
computing resources are closely
matched to the logical processing
needs. We shouldn't take this prin-
ciple as an argument against logi-
cal design; rather, it's an argument
against implementing a logical de-
sign without regard for the phys-
ical consequences.
Locality is a key aspect of dis-
tributed design. Smith discusses four
types of locality: spatial (closeness
in distance), temporal (closeness in
time), effectual (closeness in pur-
pose), and degree (closeness in ca-
pacity): all four apply to the design
of client systems. For example, the
locality principle tells us to:
] Perform all user interface
logic on the client workstation
(spatial)
D Store procedures for stan-
dard database processing with the
data they manipulate (spatial)
D Use systematic data repli-
cation schemes to distribute appro-
priately organized data closer to its
users (spatial)
D Avoid applications that as-
semble their data at execution time
from databases at separate locations
(temporal)
D Use dedicated servers when
application performance is critical

evant by the object's creator-and
only those characteristics. For this
reason, a business object is also an
abstraction or ''distillation'' of the
essential characteristics of the thing
it represents.
All data, procedures, and con-
straints that are part of an object
must be related to the central con-
cept the object represents. Every-
thing an object knows is represent-
ed in its data. Everything an object
does is performed by its procedures.
A business object's data is only
accessible to the outside world
through the object's procedures. The
outside world does not even know
how the methods themselves are
implemented. This process is known
as encapsulation, which is one of
the more important (and most mis-
understood) characteristics of
objects.
Encapsulation enforces pro-
cess and data integrity, Consider
the difference between a data table
accessed by 20 different programs
and SQL queries and a business
object being accessed by the same
20 ''clients'' The table's data is com-
pletely open to interpretation by
each program and query. Business
rules and integrity constraints are
enforced by the client, not the ta-
ble. True, part of this problem lies
with RDBMS implementations, but
the relational model itself is not
behavior-based. The relational
model deals with normalization of
data, not data and process and con-
straints. Furthermore, while sub-
routine libraries, design reviews,
and production controls could theo-
retically mitigate data and process
integrity problems, in reality these
problems continue to grow. Data
tables and subroutines do not pro-
vide sufficient encapsulation to
hide differences in application re-
quirements, cross-organization per-
spectives, data location, and het-
erogeneous hosting, and the reality
of a development process where
applications-development groups
define the process. Process and
data integrity problems cannot be
corrected as long as ''data people''
and ''process people'' argue over
the data structures and semantics.
Business objects provide a mecha-
nism for integrating and normaliz-
ing business data, procedures, and
constraints into manageable pack-
ages. As we will see, these pack-
Roles are like parts in a theat-
rical play, Actors take on roles, or
parts, in the play. A given actor
may take on more than one role
during the course of a play. The
role is not the actor, but the actor
takes on the properties of the role
while in the part. Object roles work
in much the same way: A business
object can take on different roles
for different purposes; however
unlike an actor, an object can take
on more than one role at one time!
In this sense, roles are not exclu-
sive (for example, given object A
with roles B and C, A can play B or
C, but A can play B and C simulta-
neously as well). Note another dif-
ference between types and roles: A
type alters what an object is, while
a role masks what the object is.
With roles, the underlying object
remains unchanged. A common ex-
ample of roles will help: Custom-
er, vendor, and employee are roles
played by a business object known
as party (such as a legal party, in-
volved party, or legal entity). Be-
cause a role looks the same as a
business object, we universally re-
fer to roles and the ''underlying''
business object as business objects.
Why? Because from the viewpoint
of someone interacting with the
role, the object has become the
role!
In short, an object presents a
clearly defined interface or proto-
col by which outsiders may use its
services. To get work done by or
request data from a business ob-
ject, you must know how to identi-
fy the object, what to ask for, and
how to phrase the request.
OBIECTS AND ENTITIES
In several respects, objects have a
similar ''feel'' to concepts like enti-
ties, tables, and domains:
D All (at least when well de-
fined) represent some aspect(s) of
a business concept.
D Al1 contain information or
data in some form.
D There could be a 1:1 map-
ping among the domain of an enti-
ty, a table, and a business object.
D Asking an object for data is
similar in concept to using SQL on
an RDBMS: You must identify the
data source (the database and ta-
ble). know what to ask for (the col-
umn names), and how to phrase
the request (the ordering, selection,

of the existing database design.
5. Quality Graphics Presentations
Silverrun supports standard Win-
dows graphics-display properties.
The analyst can specify color for an
individual symbol, which can vary
for the outline, text, and background.
Fonts are defined by symbol type.
The analyst can select which
name to display for entities: full
name, coded name, or alias. Attri-
bute data type and lengths aren't
displayable. Relationship arc names
correspond to verb phrases in the
binary modeling approach. The
product will display these names,
but they must be unique for each
entity. I found it difficult to come up
with different a verb statement for
each of the arcs emanating from the
same entity when the relationships
represented very similar roles.
The analyst can select which
process properties are displayed on
a DFD, as well as add timestamps
and free-form text to the diagrams.
6. Ease of Use
In general, I found Silverrun very
easy to use. Its approach to modeling
is very compatible with my own. It
conforms to the majority of the Win-
dows diagramming standards, such
as sizing, symbol movement, and
rubberband selection. However, it
doesn't support alignment, back-to-
front, and symbol grouping.
Excellent, easy-to-read docu-
mentation accompanies Silverrun.
Tutorials are also easy to follow,
which is fortuitous-I found the
tutorials essential in learning the
Silverrun methodology. Many of
Silverrun's modeling techniques
use different terminology for con-
cepts with which we are already
familiar. The index is defined in
these terms, so until you get up to
speed in the Silverrun vocabulary,
much of it is similar to switching
from French to Italian, You can
discern what a lot of the terms mean
because of their similarity to the
original language, but a learning
curve is involved.
Help facilities for the product
are, for all practical purposes, un-
available. Hitting Fl doesn't work.
Selecting the help menu bar options
only provides a cryptic overview of
the toolbar functions. However, the
help facilities provided through the
expert functions in ERX are excel-
lent. They provide a description of
the anomaly detected, with examples
to assist the analyst in understand-
ing the issue. Alternate tactics for re-
solving the issue are provided. For
example, alternatives for selecting an
identifier are ''generate,'' which cre-
ates a surrogate identifier, or select-
ing from the available attributes and
relationships. In all cases, a ''post-
pone decision'' option is provided.
The connection /relationship
lines track incredibly well. The lines

Note that with thr create you can no
longer rely on your stack to autogrow.
The kernel supports autogrowth of a
stack when you run out of stack space,
but since the kernel isn't handling
threads, it doesn't know anything about
the threads' stacks. Thus, you have to al-
locate a big-enough stack right from the
tbr create call.
Threads and Signals
YOu can set up separate signal masks for
each thread in a process. A signal sent
to a UNID process from another UNID
process via killiprocess, id,sgnalL id).
however, will only go to a thread enabled
to catch that signal. If more than one
thread is accepting a particular signal, the
signal may be delivered to any accept-
ing thread.
For this and other reasons, Novell rec-
ommx:nds that instead of dealing with sig-
nals on a thread-by-thread basis, appli-
cations mask all signals in all threads and
dedicate a single thread to wait on in-
coming signals via sgtaitt An ''object
thread'' program that adds a signal han-
dler thread to Listing One is available elec-
tronically see ''Availability.' page 5). As
always, it pays to build an appropriately
limited signal set. Two new signals have
been defined in UW 2.0 to support the
threads llb, SIGWAITING and SIGLWP.
SIGWAITING happens when all LNTs in
the processes' LWP pool are blocked in-
terruptibly. In tbreadd&, this occurs when
thread 1 is in getsf , thread 2 is sitting in
a sigwait(, and all the other threads are
either suspended or sleeping. If you add
SIGWAITING to an object-thread pro-
gram's signal set, the process will stop ac-
cepting user input.

Fire(), which executes a transition from
one state to the following state within that
class, much like the C function call de-
scribed in my previous article. However,
before the child's BS Fire() function fires,
it calls the parents BS Fire(), thereby al-
lowing the parent controllers to traverse
their own internal transitions.
Similarly, a controller starts up in its de-
fault state for example, the ldle state in

parent class from its children. In Figure 5,
for example, the controller actually starts

Together C++ opens with four win-
dows. You diagram your model in the
object-model window: see Figure 5. The
other three windows contain the classes
in your diagram, subjects, and graphical
views of your project. The exciting fea-
ture is that if you type in the code in the
editor window, the diagram window will
be updated and vice versa. YOur code and
diagram always reflect each other. You
create a Class-Obfect either by clicking
on the right mouse hutton and selecting
class or subject from a pop-up menu or
by clicking on the Class-Obfect icon in
the floating toolbar. Together C++ will
prompt you for the name of the Class-
Object and generate the .hpp and cpp
files. Together C++ arranges the symbols
within the object-model window; you can
override this feature by switching to man-
ual or semi-automatic. In semi-automatic
mode, you arrange the symbols and To-
gether C++ arranges the relationship con-
nections. In manual mode, you handle
arranging the symbols and the placement
of their connections. Manual mode also
allows you to show the class multiplici-
ties (One-to-many or one-to-One rela-
tionships between WboleTart classes) for
every class on the diagram. The other

seasick at all, If you dont have any ex-

that you will have some adverse reac-

It is important to recognize that sea-

matters worse. Fatigue and anxiety
also increase the effects of motion dis-

the ear several hours before you go to
sea and the medication is absorbed
through the skin. This is a very effec-
tive way to reduce the symptoms of
seasickness, but it can cause some un-
pleasant side effects, such as visual dis-
turbances, drowsiness, and confusion.
Scopolamine should be used only after
discussion with your medical practi-
tioner. Often, using only half a patch
will provide significant relief without
noticeable side effects.
One drug combination that is par-
ticularly successful at offsetting sea-
sickness is promethazine (Phenergan)

the boat, working the flashing spinner toward the nearest
stump. Bass hate seeing a goody get away by crawling up on
something, and this fish made a major commotion grabbing
the lure when it got a second chance.
Clunn seemed impressed.
''Tve heard all my life about teasing a bass back into strik-
ing again,' he said seriously, ''but thats the first time I ever
saw it work well enough to make me think it might be
worth the time. HowYd you know the fish was going to still
be there? You think its a better percentage play than just
making another cast to a new spot?'
I had to laugh. Here was one of the worlds best bass fish-
ermen--one of the biggest money winners in professional
bass fishing history-and hes asking mei
''Theres always something to be learned,' he said.''I used
to follow your columns in the Houton Cbronide when I was
first learning to fish. Some of the things you wrote about
wading up behind me one early spring afternoon in 1942,
and I didn't even hear him. Pearl Harbor had happened a
few months before, and I was worrying that my dad might
have to go to war, There were to be no more reels for the
duration, nor shotgun shells, but lots of other things were
troubling me then, such as how humans could be smart
enough to invent algebra, but still couldnt cure acne.
Fourteen was starting out as a big year for getting turned
down by both girls and bass.
The ubir of Jesss reel brought me back to reality, and the
first thing I noticed about his casting was that he was doing
it wrong. Next thing I noticed was that he was catching a
bass out of the very same brushpile Id been fruitlessly cast-
ing to for half an hour.
I couldn't believe it. Id seen that fish swirling around,
probably making a nest, but when I had dropped a plug
anywhere close shed streaked off for deeper water. I was
casting exactly the way the outdoor magazine writers said
to in those days, starting with the lure reeled up almost to
the rod tip, then coming back fast with the rod and then
forward twice as fast, with my elbow down as if I were
holding an egg against my side.This was supposed to make
the rod tip do the work. My casts just kept draping over
limbs, and I blamed it on my solid-steel rod, an ancient
product of the American Fork &. Hoe Company, which
had all the action of a pitchfork.
Jess was using a short, stiff little rod, too, except he was
letting his lure dangle about a foot below the rod tip and
giving it a sort of semicircular swoob, like whirling a
sling underhand.

the plug, the shorter its fall and the less splash it makes, If
you wrap a limb, dont just reel the plug up to the problem
and snag it, Give it slack until its a foot or two below the
limb, make a light pull with the rod to get it started
swinging, and yank it over.'
He walked on down the shoreline making those looping
casts, raising the rod just as the plug touched the water to
start it swimming back with scarcely a ripple. Right away
something grabbed it, spinning his reel handles backward
and taking line. It was a big freshwater drum, a species

Shaving an ounce or two off a reels

TThe EAA is mostfamous for its annual
l convention at Oshkosh, the biggest
aviation event in the world, But the
EAA is much more than a seven-day
convention. Its Air Adventure Museum
is open yearround, displaying aircraft
ranging from an exact replica of the
first Wright Brothers airplane to mod-
ern homebuilts. In the summer, Pioneer
Airport adjacent to the museum recre-
ates the golden age of aviation with
antique and classic airplanes flying
from its sod runway.The winner of our
contest will get to spend a day around
the fabulous airplanes of the museum
and Pioneer Airport as well as taking
the once-in-alifetime flight in the B-17.
Aluminum Overcast, a G model, was
built by Lockheed (then called Vega)
under a Boeing license in 1945. It was
delivered to the Army Air Force on May
18, as the end ofthe war was in sight, so it
went directly into storage.The airplane
was sold as surplus and passed through
many hands. It hauled freight, worked as
an aerial sprayer and photomapped virtu-
ally all ofthe countries of the Middle East.
It was saved from destruction in 1978
when warbird enthusiast Dr, Bill Harri-
son, ofTulsa, Oklahoma, bought it and
donated itto the EAA Museum in 1981.
The airplane had suffered a number
of indignities during its lifetime but the
estoration experts have healed almost
2very wound, making Aluminum: Over-
cast one of the most complete B-17s fly-
ing. The radio compartment, bomb
bay area, waist guns, turrets and other
parts of the airplane that were removed
or modified for cargo and aerial photo
work have all been restored. The guns
are back in place and the cockpit-

function in today's air traffic control sys-
tem-is faithful to the World War II era.
The airplane is painted in the markings
of the 398th Bomb Group and dupli-
cates the appearance of a B-17G, serial
number 42-85740, that was shot down
over France on August 13, 1944, while
flying its 34th combat mission.
The B-17 first flew in 1935 and first
deliveries were made to the Army in
1939. The early models had smaller
caliber and fewer guns than the E mod-
el that went into mass production at
Boeing, Douglas and Vega in 1941. The
G model was the last produced in large
numbers, though the airplane flew spe-
cial missions under many designations.
More than 12,000 B-17s of all models
were built.
The B-17 had an airspeed redline of
305 mph, but typically cruised between
160 and 200 mph. Service ceiling was
35,000 feet and typical combat range
was around 1,100 miles. Range, with
extra fuel tanks, could be stretched to
nearly 2,000 miles, A crew of 10 was
typical on B-17 combat missions. The
airplane was protected by as many as
13 .50 caliber machine guns, Typical
bomb load was 6,000 pounds.

ing condition, and those are threatened

Ifyou are outbound and it shows less
than that, you need to make a correc-
tion to the right to make the number in-
crease. Ifit's more, you need a correc-
tion to the left, That isn'tas complicated
as it sounds but it is something that
should be practiced.
The GPS 95 XL also has a map func-
tion that will show the runway as you
approach it. Maybe someday, but for now
this pilot isn't ready to use an electronic
map when sniffing for asphalt.
The GPS gives distance to the airport
but it is to the airport reference point
(uusually in the middle of the field), unless
the GPS has the database for approach-
es,Then the end of the runway would
be included.
The portable has the same level of ac-
curacy as my approach-approved GPS
155, which also has an internal battery
that will keep it going for a while after
an electrical failure. No way, though,
that I'd use the portable for approach
guidance other than in an emergency. It
doesn'thave the builtin internal moni-
tors that warn if accuracy is degraded to
below approach standards. Also, in an
emergency I'd only fly a published
NDB or VOR approach, following the
minimum published altitudes. You can
justoverlay those for a GPS, as the FAA
is doing for approved systems.
After flying both GPS systems on par-
tial panelIfound the portable simpler to
use for approaches than the approach-
approved version.
This portion of my refresher was de-
voted entirely to partial panel and the
interface with both GPS systems. The
quick update on the track being made
good is, simply, worth its weightin gold.
The standby value of a battery-powered
portable GPS to any instrument pilot
is great. Maybe it is a fun toy but it can
also handle the serious business of
helping you find an airport in time of
need. It was also interesting to get a
partial panel workout. That's some-
thing I hope never again happens for
real, but it could.
Where pilots of turboprops and jets
get to do all manner of scary and hairy
things in the simulators, there's too
much risk to trying a lot of that in an
airplane. For refreshers, though, we
can probe at the things we don't do
often so we'll be prepared if the time
comes, Do always get an instrument

Sr: Re ''Apple for the teacher'' Apr.
24). Your article on teachers' salaries
was a travesty. While I deplore NEA
manipulations, comparing teachers'
salaries and ''wage earners' ''is hardly
a valid comparison. How much col-
lege does the shipping clerk, factory
foreman or electronic assembler have?
Usually little or none, while a teacher
with a few years' service probably has a
master's degree. Please, oh please, try
to think more like intelligent people

find it unusual that our socicty that is
dependent on having an educated
populace is not committed to attract-
ing the best and brightest to the field
of education. Or is FoRBES advocat-
ing other pursuits? Is athletics or en-
tertainment more important to our
society than education? If you believe
that teachers' salaries should be medi-
ocre, you can expect that the people
attracted to be educators will be me-
diocre,and therefore you are certainly
not encouraging cxpansion in your

SIR: No school district pays a summer
vacation benefit. However, teachers
are allowed to prorate their ten-
month salary over a l2-month period.
In the summer, many teachers seek
employment in summer schools,
camps and community facilities and
continue to work with children. I
doubt that the two-month summer
vacation will ever be eliminated. The
number of industries that depend fi-
nancially upon the increased summer
revenuc generated by the families of
school children is too considerable.

SIR: Re ''Banking pops up in the

phoria over banks may be premature if
not entirely unwarranted. Banking is
not an income driven business but a
reserve driven business. Most banks
currently have reserves at 1% to 2% of
total loans,which is far too low. Banks
ought to increase the reserves for bad
debts to at least S% of total loans.
Recently banks have boosted earnings

Slot machines are illegal in California,
but the state's American lndians have fgured out
a way to operate 8,000 of them.
CW0-armed
bandits
By Nina Munk
TwO MONTHS AGO Jerald Sherred was
driving a rental truck east on Califor-
nia Interstate 10 when four police
cars, sirens blazing, pulled him over.
''I never saw so many lights,'' muses
Sherred, a 66-year-old pig farmer
from ILatah, Wash. ''It looked like a
parade.''
Unfortunately for Sherred, it was a
raid. The cops confiscated 29 slot
machines he was transporting to
Spotlight 29,an Indian-owned casino
just west of Palm Springs. Sherred
pleaded guilty to possession of slot
machines, paid a $1,234 fine and
returned home to tend to his pigs.
But the raid did nothing to slow
Spotlight 29's expansion. Since Sher-
red's arrest in March, the number of
slot machines at the casino has in-
creased from 72 to 120. The ma-
chines are extremely lucrative because
they attract masses of folks who
wouldn't otherwise gamble. Plus,
they require no workers to operate
them. Some 65%of total gaming reve-
nues in Nevada and Atlantic City, N.[.
come from slots.
But, in California these machines
are illegal. ''Slot machines are contra-
band, just like assault weapons or
marijuana,'' insists Thomas Gede, a
California Special Assistant Attorney
General. Yet at least 20 Indian reser-
vations in the state operate slots in
their casinos.
The number of illegal slot machines
in the state has grown tenfold during
the past two years, to 8,000. The
largest such operation, Barona Big
Top Casino in ILakeside,Calif., on the
Barona Indian Reservation,has 1,055
slot machines.
The Indians can thumb their noses
at Gede and other lawmen, thanks to
the 1987 landmark Supreme Court
case, California v. Cabazon Band of
Mission Indians. The decision over-
turned the state's restrictions on bin-
Says Special Assistant Attorney
General Gede: ''The state is barred
from enforcing its gambling code,
and the feds won't enforce it.''
Through thislegal hole are slipping
some entrepreneurial characters,
Meet Ronald Clapper. California law-
men say Clapper, 34, owns a quarter
of the slot machines in California and
earns around $250,000 a week. From
a nondescript building in Chats-
worth, just outside Los Angeles,
Clapper runs a company known vari-
ously as Blue Stone Managemcnt,
Sequoia Game Enterprises and Dia-
mond Game Enterprises. There he
assembles electronic slot machines for
about $2,500 apiece, and leases them
to Indian tribes in exchange for 15%
or more of the profits.
At the 1,055-slots Barona Big Top
Casino, which features Clapper ma-

evening when auto traffic is almost nonexis-
tent. There's a sense of isolation too; the
140,000 residents are bordered by a wide,
empty plain on one side and steep moun-
tains on the other.
The famous Agees were courted, natu-
rally, by high-level executives and their
spouses from MK and elsewhere. ''When
they first arrived,'says a Boise woman,''the
place was all 'Oh, wow!' Everybody was in
the curiosity-gossipy zone. Wives who used
to wear miniskirts were being all matronly
and respectable, wanting to be noticed,
wanting to have them over for dinner.''
The attention wasn't always a warm em-
brace. Pat Moore, who piloted the company
plane, sensed resistance to the Agees even
before they arrived. He traces it to Agee's
first wife, Diane, a former Boise resident
who had endured his public romancing of
Mary eight years earlier, and who had many
friends and sympathizers there. Mary por-
trayed her as cold and difficult in a book she
wrote in 1984, descriptions that didn't play
well in Boise. ''The resistance to Bill and
Mary goes back to his first wife,'' says
Moore. ''She was well liked here.''
The fallout from Agee's first marriage was
compounded by the way he left his wife. In
order to marry Cunningham in her church,
he converted to Catholicism and had his first
marriage annulled. (Mary also had her first
marriage annulled.) Mike Shirley, a former
VP of finance at Morrison Knudsen, said
Boiseans were dismayed. ''Most people can
maybe understand getting a divorce. But
Mary's chief interest was the Nurturing
Network, a charity she founded that offers
help, including housing and jobs, to give
pregnant college and working women an al-
ternative to abortion, It was an activity that
made her highly visible to bishops and car-
dinals in the Catholic Church and, even to-
day, much of her life appears to revolve
around it. In the days after Agee was fired,
several church leaders sent letters of en-
couragement to her.
Agee, who should have been sensitive to
nepotism charges after his experience at
Bendix, put Mary in charge of another char-
ity, the Morrison Knudsen Foundation. It
spends close to $l million a year on social
and cultural causes, Because running the
two charities took considerable effort, Mary
was rarely in a mood to socialize. ''Did I, at
the end of the day, enjoy putting on a
sparkly dress and greeting employees?'' she
once said. ''No. I'm tired at the end of the
day, Im not the kind of person with painted
nails.'' Even opponents concede that Mary's
commitment to her charities was sincere.
''She's not a hypocrite,' says one.
Agee's devotion to his wife seemed exces-
sive at times, For a surprise birthday party at
Pebble Beach in 1991, he flew friends and
okay to tip your hat, but he made Mary the
centerpiece. He did the same thing when we
were opening a railcar rehab plant in Chi-
cago and the governor was present.''
Mary, by all accounts, is a complicated,
unusual woman. ''She is the most astound-
ing mix of interesting, spiritual, funny,
driven,'' says an executive who was a fre-
quent companion of both Agees, ''She
wants to save the world, and she wanted to
help Bill succeed.'' What really drives the
relationship between them is, of course, un-
knowable. There is plenty of simple and
genuine affection. But Agee often seemed
overprotective of her-as if burdened by
guilt that he had crippled her career with
his Bendix speech. Agee tried hard to make
Morrison Knudsen succeed, says the exec-
utive who knows both Bill and Mary, but his
loyalties were divided between the com-
pany and his wife. ''Once on the plane he
looked at me with tears in his eyes and said,
'The first time, I put my job, my kids, my
wife in that order. And that's exactly the
wrong order.' '' He adds, ''If Bill had a
choice of screwing things up at MK or
screwing things up with Mary, he'd rather
screw up MK.''
Rightly or wrongly, Boiseans were of-
of a local Catholic charitywith a fat contribu-
tion, then withheld the gift when no seat was
offered. Another rumor had Mary screaming
at a florist's delivery boy who arrived too
early; the boy was said to be the grandson of
Joe Albertson, founder of the supermarket
chain. There were more: Mary was undergo-
ing dialysis. Mary and Bill donated a $100,000
gold cross to the local cathedral and secretly
stuck MK with the tab. None of these rumors
had any apparent basis in fact.''You couldn't
go anywhere in Boise without people saying,
'Did you hear about Mary?''' says a promi-
nent local attorney.
TR0UBLE
company plane for himself, arranged over-
size bonuses, and stuffed the board with ea-
sygoing cronies. Alas, none of that is as rare
as it should be in business--and is ignored
if all goes well.
Agee's fatal flaw was his weakness as a
manager, A CFO at heart, he relied on buy-
ing and selling assets so much that he ob-
scured MK's problems and his own short-
comings until it was too late. ''He was a
dealmaker, not a manager,'' says one Wall
Street analyst. ''He never thrived in a line
business.'' Agee didn't understand the con-
struction business, and his detour into rail-
cars was about as well planned and exe-
cuted as the charge of the Light Brigade.
His optimism and buoyancy, while engag-
ing, hurt him as well, enabling him to keep
saying things would be okay if he could just
buy more time and raise more cash until,
like Captain Oueeg in the storm, he had to
be relieved of command.
Pinning blame for Agee's dreadful rela-
tions with MK employees-and Boise it-
self-is harder, Was he vastly more insen-
sitive than other CEOs in the way he fired
and laid off people? Or was the resentment
and anxiety of employees exacerbated by
the dearth of job alternatives in a small
town like Boise? Was Mary truly haughty
and highfalutin? Or was she simply un-
happy to be in Boise, and unwittingly rat-
tling the natives by using crystal in a place
more comfortable with paper cups? Was
Bill so hopelessly in love with Mary that he
abandoned his responsibilities to Morrison
Knudsen? Or were MK employees intoler-
ant of his unabashed affection for her? Who
knows? In any case, Bill and Mary failed to
divine the cultural peculiarities of Boise and
Morrison Knudsen, which is something peo-
ple who earn $2.4 million a year are sup-
posed to be able to do.
Agee gets occasional calls from well-wish-
ers, but he lives in exile, far from the glam-
orous world he once inhabited. The friends
he put on the Morrison Knudsen board are
angry and humiliated by the problems that
erupted so suddenly there, and some have
not spoken to him since his ouster. He sits
on no boards of public companies. Despite
hisspectacular Elba at Pebble Beach, arthri-
tis keeps him from playing much golf. He is
stung, he says, by reports that portray him as
dishonest. Mostly, he is wearied by the
whole experience.''At no time was this a fun
job.''
Mary,says an old friend, is stunned by her
husband's firing but praying for the people
who did it, With real passion, she told one
caller, ''I want to convey to you how much
my husband loved that company. He
worked so hard I didn't see him a whole lot
and my children didn't, and that's what
breaks my heart,'' Morrison Knudsen em-
ployees weren't so upset. On the day Agee
was axed, they gathered in the parking lot at
company headquarters and cheered.

The Backswing Arc
Like Sam Snead and Seve Ballesteros before him, Ernie
Els swings the club with exceptionally smooth tempo,
timing, and rhythm.
From first move to finish, the elements of Els's action
flow together seamlessly. This beautiful timing lets him
whip the club faster than 125 mph yet appear so graceful
that you'd swear he's swinging in slow motion.
But many golfers make a fast swing without such out-
standing results. What makes Els different? He generates
power by swinging the club smoothly with his arms, not
iolently with his hands as many amateurs do. By keep-
ng the hands quiet, the club stays very low to the ground
'or the first two feet of the backswing. This long, low
akeaway is vital to creating a wide arc.
The width of Els's stance also encourages the long,
arms-controlled takeaway. Els spreads his feet consider-
ably wider apart than his shoulders, and sets his hands
behind the ball. Standing too narrow with the hands
ahead can lead to picking up the club quickly in the take-
away, which shrinks the size of the arc.
Once the club swings past his right foot and his weight
starts shifting to the right side, Els actively turns his
shoulders, extending his hands and the club straight back
while keeping his wrists firm. The straighter his arms
and the longer his wrists stay firm, the greater the dis-
tance between the clubhead and his body. Look at the
width of his swing at the halfway point! It doesn't get
wider-Or better--than that.
''I don't know how I got through
the week, the day, the last hole,'' he
said. ''I just held it all in until the last
putt, then let it all out. I do believe in
fate and that's what this was all
about.''
Love was in the interview room
when Crenshaw's last putt dropped
and he felt himself choke up when he
saw Crenshaw's tears. ''If I had been
alone, I would have cried, too,'' he
said.
Of course, he would have. This
was a Masters worthy of tears. Tears
of joy, tears of sorrow. Tears for a
man and a tournament both worth
remembering.
Now and forever.

that cosmology is dominated by the-
ory rather than observation, Cer-
tainly the popular pantheon of cos-
mologists is dominated by theorists
like Einstein and Hawking, but cos-
mology continues to be grounded in
the process of describing what we
see when we look up at the sky, The
Big Bang theory, relativity, and
quantum mechanics were forced
down the throat of the scientific
community because observation re-
quired us to accept them.
Physical cosmology, as viewed by
working scientists, might well be
solved soon. This will not end the
work of science, nor should it chill
any other human conversation,
Since the time of Galileo, it has
been largely voices from outside cos-
mology who have perceived it as a
threat to the legitimacy of other
ways of looking at the world. But
our bullhorns are, and always have
been, as paper cones compared with
those of political philosophers,

Thanks to Edwin Dobb for expos-
ing the absurdity-or anthropomor-
phism--of scientific fundamentalists
who claim that absolute truth, or
the Mind of God, can be known via
physics or by any scientific means,
I'd like to add another coal to his
fire by re-introducing a simple ob-
servation: As human beings, our
ability to taste, touch, smell, hear,
and see are all we can use to extract
knowledge. Meanwhile, it is entirely
possible that there are physical laws
that function outside of our sensory
domain, out of science's reach, and
while we can imagine this possibili-
ty, we cannot imagine the substance
of that possibility.
The notion of extrasensory exis-
tence frustrates the scientific funda-
mentalists just as the notion that
the Earth is not flat once frustrated
other religions. Until we can prove
that nothing in the universe is lost
to our senses, the assertion that
physicists can offer Universal Truth
is absolute rubbish. To follow
conference, whose stated aim is ''Strengthening
Democracy,'' is the man on whose generous tab
a number of them are spending the weekend, in
comfortable rooms with MTV, CNN, mini-
bars, and a lavish buffet in the Esplanade dining
hall: the American uncle himself-Carl Gersh-
man, the president of the National Endowment
for Democracy. As Gershman leans in toward
the microphone, the tension covers the room
like a thick, wet fog. Many of the Eastern Euro-
peans have paid their own way here, leaving
behind the fragile work of editing newspapers
and radio broad-
casts, educating cit-
important that the conference have concrete
results. What is the National Endowment for
Democracy' they wonder. How much money
will it give! In the gilt-edged mirrors behind
Gershman's head is reflected the enormous jew-
eled scarab, with its Byzantine reds and blues,
that sits in the center of the ballroom ceiling, a
woman's gold brooch blown up to several thou-
sand times its original size.
The microphone buzzes, but the Eastern Eu-
ropeans are too deep in their imaginings to
flinch. 'The National Endowment for Democ-
racy is an independent, nongovernmental foun-
dation which receives a grant from the Con-
gress every year for the purpose of strengthening
democracy around the world,'' Gershman be-
gins, He is a tall, thin man with the look of a
modern-day Calvinist who has given up the
corruptions of the flesh for a pure diet of univer-
salist ideas. ''We have a journal in which we
publish essays and articles on democracy, and
we organize research conferences on democra-
cy,' Gershman explains. ''We are compiling a
database which will soon be available over the
Internet. We will hold our fifth world confer-
ence on democracy in Washington on May l.
We do work in ninety-two countries around the
world,'' he continues, ''in China, Uzbekistan,
and, yes, the countries in this region.''
At the mention of the ninety-two countries,
you can see the eyes of the former Yugoslavs
narrow with the effort of mental arithmetic, a
calculus whose result can be seen a few seconds
later in a universal slump of the shoulders. This
slump deepens several minutes later with the
presentation by the Endowment's shrewd and
genial program officer for Central Europe, Faul
McCarthy. ''A good chunk of our money goes
to four U.S.-based organizations,'' says Mc-
Carthy, with the air of a teacher explaining
some unpleasant tact of nature to his wonder-
ing pupils, like the way the female praying
mantis bites off the head of the male when
they make babies,''the Free Trade Union Insti-
tute, which you have heard from, the National
Democratic Institute, the International Repub-
lican Institute, the Center for International
Private Enterprise. The rest of the money.. ''
Among the more experienced of the partici-
pants, the change in manner is immediately
evident. They have stopped taking notes. The
ninety-two countries, the broad, friendly
smiles, the global visions of building democra-
cy--you can see them adding it all up to con-
clude that there will be no computers, no
printing presses, no radio transmitters, no
money for paper, no hands-on assistance of the
kind (the participants are quick to inform you)
given to them by the representatives of George
Soros, the American financier.
Like any rich man who gives away some
large portion of his estate without any immedi-
ate motive, Ueorge Soros has attained among
the Eastern European participants the unques-
tioned authority of a god. The absence of
Soros Foundation representatives at this con-
ference is the subject of incessant conspiratori-
al conversations over cigarettes and coffee in
the Esplanade lounge, where black-bearded
Montenegrin men, the stars of the confer-
ence-all well over six feet tall and carrying
themselves with the atavistic air of having
stepped out of some faded nineteenth-century
engraving of Balkan mountain bandits-raise
silver-headed walking sticks at hawkish Mace-
donian women. There is a plot to undermine
George Soros financed by the government of
Greece, which opposes the work of Soros in
Macedonia. The Greek government is respon-
sible for the recent article attacking Soros, an
article filled with lies and provocations, by
Connie Bruck in The Neu Yorker magazine.
They shake their heads. Don't the Americans
understand that it is only Soros who helps us!
The editor of The Neu Yorker, someone ex-
plains, is a Greek with ties to the secret police.
No, no, someone objects, it is her husband, an
Englishman, who has ties to the army.
Objections to these and other amazing ideas
are met with the gentlest of stares and only the
slightest discernible rolling of eyes: Americans
are, after all, a very young people. Are we not
aware that the Serbs and the Croats will soon
go to war! And that, when they do, surround-
ing countries with claims to the region-the
Albanians and the Greeks; the Russians, with
their Slavic ties to the Serbs; the Muslim
Turks, who once ruled Bosnia; the Italians,
DOU BLE MIROSTIC NO. 149
f' N REceNrEARs.Central America has begun
i asurprising transition from rule by arms-
i and opposition by violence-to govern-
i ment by free and fair elections. Oi he sis
. nations of the Mesoamerican isthmus, only
Costa Rica had a democratic regime in 1980,
though Honduras' de facto military president
was by then engineering a gradual transition to
civilian rule. Nicaragua had just begun what
would become a decade of Marxist-Leninist
revolution and of violent struggle against coun-
terrevolution. El Salvador was spinning toward
civil war as a US-backed junta struggled to sur-
vive against explosive popular opposition and
a revolutionary insurrection. In Guatemala, a
fraudulently elected military president faced a
rapidly rebuilding leftist guerrilla insurgency.
Panama's president, chosen indirectly by a non-
partisan ''revolutionary'' assembly, was a fig-
urehead for populist military leader Omar
Torrijos. The prospects for democracy could
hardly have been bleaker.
Though Central America's authoritarian rul-
ers frequently held elections, they also fre-
quently manipulated and undermined those
elections through shenanigans of every sort.
With the exception of Costa Rica, no regime in
the isthmus had ever held a free and fair elec-
tion and then peacefully transferred power to a
victorious opponent prior to 1980. Once again
excluding Costa Rica, from 1930 to 1979, Cen-
tral American nations averaged one coup d'etat
per decade and a presidential election (mostly
fraudulent or overturned by force) only once
every seven years.
Since 1980, however, Central America-like
the rest of Latin America and much of the
former Communist world-has undergone a
democratic transformation. Most of the nations
of the isthmus are now governed by fairly
elected and constitutional civilian regimes. Per-
haps the most startling evidence of this demo-
cratic transformation is that in the most recent
election in every Central American nation, in-
cumbents from one party have willingly relin-
quished power to their freely elected opponents.
The causes of this transition from authori-
tarianism to democracy, the nature of the re-
cent electoral reforms and the prospects for de-
mocracy on the isthmus all warrant thorough
investigation.
Background of Electoral Reform
Although Central America's first indepen-
dent governments were constitutional repub-
lics, they failed to establish a strong tradition of
democracy, Except for Panama's US-influenced
secession from Colombia in 1903, the modern
Central American nations first formed in 1823
as provinces of the Central American Federa-
tion (CAF). The CAF opted for a republican con-
stitution, thus grounding the government's le-
gitimacy in the consent of the people. The
principle of republicanism survived in the
fledgling nations' constitutions after the
federation's breakup, circa 1840. Despite such
republican pretensions, however, true popular
sovereignty developed very slowly in Central
America. During most of the 19th century, elites
dominated politics and governed by intrigue
and force of arms more commonly than by bal-
lots, Presidents were elected indirectly, and par-
ticipation in the few elections that took place
was typically confined to literate, property-
owning males.
Direct presidential elections, the secret bal-
lot and universal male and female suffrage were
not achieved throughout the region until 1965.
Moreover, these legislated improvements did
not guarantee an effective electoral role for the
populace. Authoritarian rulers regularly ma-
nipulated elections and repressed their politi-

Mixed
Strategy for
Migration
Refugees and Economic Migrants
opAY, MORE THAN EVER, the tumultuous
movements of people occurring through-
out the world are pushing the problems of
migration and forced displacement to the
w top of the international agenda. A com-
plex mix of economic, demographic, social, re-
ligious, ethnic and political processes occurring
simultaneously at the local, national and inter-
national levels are forcing people to move away
from their homes and countries. This article fo-
cuses on one aspect of the larger migration de-
bate: refugee movements-particularly where
these refugee movements are mingled with eco-
nomic migration.
The security concerns of affected states are
dominated by the violent causes of forced dis-
placement, but the problem of migration has
many different facets. Poverty, economic de-
cline, environmental degradation and demo-
graphic pressures lead people to move to new
areas in search of a better livelihood. These
factors also exacerbate the inequities arising
out of religious, ethnic or political divisions
that may lead to violence and further refugee
flow. Thus, the same or similar situations may
produce both refugees and economic mi-
grants, Given the ease of international travel,
both groups may move to the same countries
or areas. This mixed character of today's
movements necessitates a comprehensive
strategy that meets the diverse needs of refu-
gees and economic migrants and simulta-
neously addresses the causes and solutions
of their problems.
Any comprehensive response to population
movement must be based on a clear under-
standing of the international refugee system
and the fundamental difference between refu-
gee flows and migratory movements.
Responses to Forced Migration
Today, there are over 20 million refugees and
persons of concern to the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) who
have been forced to flee their country in fear of
persecution, war and violence. The majority of
refugees and other persons of concern to
UNHCR are in Africa (7.5 million) and Europe
(6 million), followed by Asia (5.7 million) and
the Americas (1.4 million). The number of mi-
grants worldwide is estimated to be over 100
million.
Their need for international protection sets
refugees apart from economic migrants. Refu-
gees flee because their governments are unwill-
ing or unable to protect them from persecution
for reasons of race, nationality, political opin-
ion or religious belief. More commonly, refu-
gees flee from the brutal effects of internal con-
flict and violence. Economic migrants, on the
other hand, move in search of improved em-
ployment opportunities or for other personal
reasons. Though their reasons for moving may
be compelling, they are not of the same life-
threatening quality as in the case of refugees.
Perhaps because of this difference, the issue
of interstate migration has remained within the
sovereign prerogative of states, whereas the
granting of international protection to refugees
has come within the purview of international
law. UNHCR and the 1951 Convention relating
to the Status of Refugees form the basis upon
which the post World War II refugee system
was established. UNHCR was mandated by the
UN General Assembly to provide international
protection to refugees and to find solutions to
their problems, such as voluntary repatriation
or integration in a new community. The 1951
Convention relating to the Status of Refugees
binds party states to internationally agreed stan-
dards for the admission, protection and treat-
ment of refugees. One of the most important
I
sider, but careful deliberation upon the
fundamentals outlined here will be a ma-
jor step toward solidifying and validating
a global free trade system.
Positive Sums from Cooperation
The bottom line of the emergence of the
new WTO from GATT is that world trade
will be institutionalized in the formal legal
structure of an international organization.
The more formal status of the WTO will
allow it to give more focus and publicity to
efforts that attemptto create greater global
cooperation in international trade. The in-
stitutionalization ot trade through the
WTO will give some bite to the bark of a
well-articulated set of trading rules and
policies. With its creation, there will exist
an independent political entity that can
view the world trading system from a ho-
listic perspective and to check and balance
competing interests that seek to bend the
trading rules in their national or sectoral
favor. By paying judicious attention to the
fundamental issues in international trade,
the WTO has the potential of becoming a
visionary organization that outlines a bold
path for international trade and leads the
world into a new economic renaissance.
Recent studies have released estimates
of the global economic etfects ot the ratiti-
cation of the GATT Uruguay Round and
the creation of the World Trade Organiza-
tion. A GATT report released in Novem-
ber 1994 prognosticated that implementa-
tion of the Uruguay Kound will spur an
increase of $510 billion a year in world in-
come by the year 20(05. This tigure is a vast
underestimate, for it does not account for
the impact of strengthened procedures and
rules in the services trade or better dispute
settlement mmmechanisms. Breaking up the
gains by region, the report predicted that
by 2005 the annual income gain will be
S122 billion for the United States, $164 bil-
lion for the European Union, $27 billion
for Japan and $1l6 billion for the develop-
ing and transitional socialist economies as
a group. figures estimating the increase in
volume in the goods trade range from nine
to 24 percent once the liberalization of the
LUruguay Kound comes into effect. In 1992
dollars, this gain represents an increase in
trade flows ofupwards of$670billion. The
report also suggests that Uruguay Round
provisions for developing and transition
economies will have the intended result of
encouraging rapid growth, as exports and
imports from this group are likely to be 50
percent over and beyond the increase for
the rest of the world as a whole. The eco-
nomic impact ot a well-structured and
credible institutionalization of interna-
tional trade is likely to be enormous.

than had been originally estimated,
thanks to difficulties in getting the soft-
ware up to speed. That delay shut down
sales and precipitated the business's in-
augural cash crisis. It was a rite of pas-
sage for Kashou the salesman, who
learned that if he had no code, he had no
product, and if he had no product, he had
no sales, As the Collectech sales jocks
put it, ''No heat, no eat.''
If the original system was antiquated, it
was the best the company could do on a
start-up budget. Once it was finally run-
ning, it sufficed. After all, it had only to
fire off letters and keep track of them.
But problems quickly began to prolifer-
ate. Data-corrupting disk-drive crashes
drove home the importance of hardware
reliability. Having to cajole a contract pro-
grammer to add features and fix bugs initi-
ated Kashou into the mysteries of software
and those who wrote it. He was getting a
crash course in computers, like it or not,
on the front lines of his business.
The company's sales soared, from
$170,000 in its first year to a profitable
million dollars in revenues in year three.
But the rapid growth only exacerbated
problems with an inflexible and not al-
ways reliable system. Even when the disk
wasn't crashing, it lumbered through
queries like a weary nag, whirring end-
lessly before finding the answer to a re-
quest. Because the database behind it was
little but one huge file, finding information
meant navigating an essentially unmarked
forest of bits and bytes. Searches took for-
ever. And every report had to be custom
designed by the contract programmer.
Nothing could be modified or repaired
without him.
When the reliability problems became
too frequent and too frightening to bear,
Kashou persuaded his partners to invest in
transferring the software to a PC network.
But the contract programmer never did
get the old software to run quite right on
the new hardware. Screens froze, forcing
users to continually reboot. Memory er-
rors corrupted files, scuttling the day's
work, A simple data-entry error could
stupefy the system and derail the daily
batch processing of letters and invoices.
Having to restart the system could shut
operations down for an entire day. The
company was accumulating strikes with
important accounts.
The company's second system also
lacked badly needed features, such as ac-
counting capabilities. Service reps still
had to track commissions and accounts
receivable manually. The software
couldn't accommodate credit terms and
other specially negotiated service and
payment plans that salespeople were
now regularly extending to customers.
To cope, the back-office troops created
a web of spreadsheets and manual track-
ing methods. The beleaguered controller
reconciled revenues manually each week
and juggled no fewer than a dozen spread-
sheets to come up with financial state-
ments each month. Meanwhile, the com-
pany was bringing in new clients at the
rate of two a day, By 1991 there were
nearly a million debtor records in the
cranky system. And the problems were
getting worse.
But Kashou kept putting off a system
overhaul. It wasn't until 1992, when sales
reached $3.2 million, and profits, after
generous bonuses, had neared half a mil-
lion that executive vice-president Brad
Jadwin stepped before the company board
to plead for an entirely new system. ''The
snafus were starting to affect us in the
marketplace,'' says Jadwin, ''We were
risking client relationships.''

was possible because places like Milan had no less than
five mail deliveries every day. You could drop a line to
friends in the city and be fairly confident that they
would receive it in, say, three hours; if you sent the note
in the morning to friends in the suburbs, it would arrive
by nightfall. All of which means that Verdi and Boito
would probably have derived little benefit from E-mail--
hey had a good post office.
Then the archivist showed me some of Verdi's corre-
pondence during a production of, I believe, Aida at the
Paris Opera, Evidently the show was not going well. Af-
ter sitting through each morning's rehearsals, the com-
poser retired to his hotel room at lunchtime to flame

' &Ltennial, Wyo. The town was
founded in 1876 and brags a population
of about 100. Right off our back deck is
the north fork of the Laramie River. We're
at 8,200 feet and surrounded by Aspen
trees, We have a wood-burning stove, and
we sleep in a log bed that my wife, Brenda,
made by hand. When we moved out here, I
figured I was going to become this moun-
tain-man-type person. Well, I spend all
my time up in this mountain-man cabin-
but working on the computer. Meanwhile,
my wife goes shopping for the day and
comes back with a brand-new chain saw.
The business I work for, Aspen Tree
Software, which helps companies comput-
erize employee interviews, is really flexi-
ble about letting its employees telecom-
mute. It has a very loose structure, but
only because everybody works to keep
communication tight. We have a Shiva
network at the main office, in Laramie,
that I can hook into from my cabin. We
also use a program called Close-Up,
which allows those of us off-site to dial
into one another's computers. I go into the
office once or twice a week, and that's
pretty much when I need to talk to people
rather than do creative-type things.'
In my home office I put my Schwinn
Air Dyne bike underneath a large, 53-
inch-high desk platform, and I sometimes
pedal while I work. My office also has a
Postscript printer, a fax machine, a 486
computer with two gigabytes of hard-
drive space, a six-disk CD-ROM drive,
and an STB Lightning video card with two
megs of RAM. That's pretty heady stuff.
m a discus thrower and have been on
some international shot-put teams. I went
to the Olympic trials for track and field in
1988 and 1992, and am considering going
in '96. Two or three times a year I video-
tape myself throwing. I'll capture the shots
in a digitized format on the computer and
then study them to improve my technique.
On nice days I'll take a laptop, a
Thinkpad 486 with 16 megs of RAM, and
go up in the mountains to train-legwork
stuff like sprints or climbing-and as ideas
pop into my head, I have everything right
there and can run with them. I usually set
the laptop on the front of my Chevy truck
or on one of the rock outcroppings. Every
once in a while I'll go up in the mountains
for three or four days-there are some
cabins up there. I'l take a cellular, and
that's the only phone contact I'll have.
You definitely have to be a self-starter
to work this way. I'd say I work 75% on
inspiration and 25% on discipline, just be-
cause I'm so into it. If I have an idea at 2
a.m., I know I'm going to just pop up to
my office and execute it. My philosophy
for the past eight years has been that every
day's a weekend, but I work weekends.
On a typical day I wake up between 3
and 6 a.m, and immediately go to my of-
fice to work. This is pure uninterrupted
development time. At sunrise I go for a
short walk or run and plan the day. The
mountains are to the south and west, and
there are 30 miles of open plains to the
east before there are more mountains,
which makes for spectacular sunrises.
Around noon in the summer I put on my
waders, grab my fly rod, and head 10 miles
up the road, where there are 150 alpine
lakes within a 5-mile radius. I'll spend an
hour or so there, catching little brook trout.
From 7:30 until bedtime is another sa-
cred development time. Occasionally I'll
pull an all-nighter. When I do, I'm good till
about 5 p.m. before I crash and make my
whole schedule haywire for several days.

Why the Dollar is Down
F THE UNITEDD STATES wERE NOT
still the world's preeminent
economic power with the most
important currency, the In-
ternational Monetary Fund
would be ordering President Clinton to bal-
ance the federal budget, cut back imports, and
raise interest rates and/ or taxes to repair U.S.
accounts with the rest of the world.
That's what the iMF has done to other coun-
tries, from Germany to Britain to Mexico, for
more than five decades since it was set up in
1944. It has acted as the world's banker and
arbiter, telling nations to get their economic
houses in order if they want further credit.
The United States has been exempt from
such strictures because of its power and the
dollar's role as reserve currency, the money
all countries rely on as an ultimate means of
exchange in global trade. Thus it has been
able to run trade and budget deficits without
taking immediate action to correct them.
LLately, however, those continued U.S.
deficits have begun to look like the self-indul-
gence of a pampered adolescent. The United
States has been reprimanded in recent years
by gradual reductions in the dollar's value
and in U.S. influence in the world.
But now the overgrown adolescent is
going to the woodshed. A sterner reckoning is
coming that will demand the United States
move toward a balanced budget and run its
affairs to support the value of the dollar.
We should understand why that is, be-
cause other currency crises will follow this
one unless corrective action is taken.
In the aftermath of the dollar's latest
swoon against the German mark and [apan-
ese yen, international experts say an extraor-
dinary meeting of the seven leading industri-
al countries will be convened, probably next
month, to stabilize currency relationships and
possibly increase U.S. interest rates by as
much as a full percentage point.
Yes, that would slow the U.S. economy and
impose hardships on Americans. But that's the
fate of borrowers with slipping credit ratings,
and U.S. credit has been falling among global
ployment. That's why Ger-

Perpetual $tagnation
Unfortunately, the IS managers
who declare their careers are at a
dead end are right. Worse, the IS pro-
fession perpetuates this stagnation
by remaining silent while pundits
proclaim that IS managers must
learn the business to gain admission
to the boardroom.
Experienced professionals in
accounting, human resources, or
sales are commonly thought capable
by senior management of offering
sound advice outside the bounds of
their profession. However, similarly
experienced IS professionals are
almost universally presumed to be
lacks confidence in the person's
basic business abilities, it's safe to
conclude the CEO made a major hir-
ing mistake.
Yet, if the IS manager is compe-
tent, then why isn't that manager
sitting in on important decisions?
Unfortunately, most CEOs aren't
even aware that a problem exists.
There is a likely historical expla-
nation for this tendency to isolate
otherwise competent adults. Decades
ago, computers were the province of
a few technicians who supported
accounting and finance, but were
otherwise isolated from the organi
zation, Although IS today supports
virtually all of a company's business
functions, IS managers remain en-
meshed in a system that is biased
against them.
We can understand this system by
reviewing a simple chain of cause
and effect. IS is the corporate infra-
structure of all sizeable businesses.
Pare it away and the business will
halt and die.
The dependence on a field as
young as IS has unfortunate conse-
quences: IS is feared, and it makes
people frustrated and angry because
it's not well understood. When igno-
rance, fear, and anger are present,
human nature responds with neglect
and organizational abuse: the glass
ceiling. It exists even when both IS
and general management want to do
a good job and work as a team.
What can you do about this fun-
damental inequity and organization-
al shortsightedness?
Not much. You aren't in a position
to change your organization alone.
However, here are two actions we
can take to start a movement toward
healthier organizations:
First, IS managers must stop beat-
ing themselves up about imaginary
inadequacies. We should need to do
no more than professionals in other
fields in order to join senior manage-
ment as peers.
Second, next time you hear some-
one decry the lack of business knowl-
edge among IS professionals, ask
them why they aren't also condemn-
ing this failing among colleagues in
sales or engineering. Don't let people
say that your profession is not up to
the mark when it's simply not true.
Unless you challenge them, you're
part of the problem.

This cyberlibrarian would be sad to
see libraries go the way of horse-drawn
carriages, Libraries for me are places to
work and play, and the Web just hasn't
managed to capture the atmosphere, con-
templative silence, and feel of a book in my
hands that I get at a library.
Still, the Internet has the advantage of
always being open and often has more cur-
rent information. I believe the Internet will
complement libraries and not replace them.
That's why I'm surprised when people ask
me where to find ''the library'' on the
Internet. I tend to think of the whole
Internet as a library resource. What these
people are looking for are the traditional
library resources on the Internet. Although
it's not an exhaustive list, following are
some of the places I patronize.
Books, Hines, Hacts
One of my favorite Internet sources is
Project Gutenberg, an online library of clas-
sics, The project's goal is ''to provide a col-
lection of 10,000 of the most used books by
the year 2001.'' Relying on volunteers,
Project Gutenberg has already put the full
text of many books online. If you'd like to
browse the archive or volunteer to help, ftp
to wueoon,wustlleds. To obtain the latest infor-
mation, subscribe to the mailing list by send-
ing a message to istserv@viscvmd.hitnet with
sub g9tnberg Rur Mame in the message body.
You must include two words in your name.
Do not list your title or occupation because
doing so will hold up your subscription.
Magazines also are migrating to the
Internet. There are hundreds of electronic
magazines (called e-zines), but if you're
interested in the paper-published ones, trav-
el to the Table of Contents site at http://
wWW.mog-browse.com. Run by Cyberspace
Publishing, it provides the tables of con-
tents and brief summaries of articles of
more than 170 magazines, Categories
include computers, electronics, music, sci-
ence, and sports, Only the abstracts are pro-
vided; if you want to read the whole article,
you must buy the magazine.
The Statistical Abstract of the United
States also is on the Web (at ttp:/ /www.
census.gov:80/stat abstract). The site has
tables, graphs, state rankings, and state and
county profiles. It is searchable, but you
might have better luck following the links.
Another site of traditional library
sources is CARIL, which has periodical
guides as well as Grolier's Academic
American Encyclopedia and Facts on File,
There are fees for some of the services. To
check out CARIL, telnet to database.amrl.org.
Cheaper alternatives are sites created
by universities or public libraries. These
often are great sources, but remember that
they were originally created for their own
communities. Portland Area Library System
has a comprehensive Gopher site with peri-
odical guides, a wide variety of databases,
and a good reference shelf (gopher.portals,
pdx.sdu). Its best feature may be the Top 10
lists that let you go to the most popular sites
in a category of your choice.
One of the best online libraries I've
found is the Gopher site at the Virginia
Military Institute. It's divided into ''rooms''
2 TEARET AORL0 JuNE 1985
and houses full-text sources of poetry,
prose, and electronic journals. Its material
includes such diverse topics as career
information, multimedia resources,
recipes, and weauher. Tnere 's also a
searchable reference collection. To visit,
gopher to vax.vmiedu.
The University of Texas hosts the
Virtual Compuer Library, a Web site that
provides links to computer and comput-
ing information. Its categories include
books, conferences, journals, magazines,
organizations, and vendors. It's at
http:/ /www.atexas.edu/computer/vcl.
Another coamon question people
ask librarians is, ''What is the Internet?''
Matrix Information and Directory
Services (M1i)S) provides some answers,
It offers staistics on how many users are
on the Internet and divides them into three
goupS-core, consumer, and matrix.

The Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee has established a Web site
(htp://www.dsatarg/d/dsatuhtml) containing
news, press releases, poll statistics, and
quotes related to the 1996 election. It also
provides links to related Net sources.

A government information server
called CapWeb has been created by Capitol

ested. There also are biographies of
NOW officers and information about the
organization.
The American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) maintains a Gopher site that
houses ACLU literature, newsletters, pub-
lications, and court and Congressional
actions in which the organization is
involved-including a list of current
issues, such as liberties in cyberspace.
There's also a history of the organization,
a list of affiliate offices, and guidelines on
how to get help from the ACLU (gopher

celed messages posted by outspoken
detractors of the religion. The group
claimed the posts contained copyrighted
material, but many on the Internet called
the attempt a foul act of censorship.
Should Usenet messages be automati-
cally censored in software? Is Cancelmoose
a hero or villain? You decide.
Kevin Fox, a student at the University
of California at Berkeley, uses a less dras-
tic tactic to squelch spammers. He sends
them a polite e-mail message. His elo-
quent message below echoes the consen-
sus of 99 percent of Usenet's populous.
''We on the Net live by only a few
rules, but one should be most important to
you as an advertiser on the Net (in itself
viewed as an inauspicious venture by
many): There is no message of any level
of importance that warrants being blasted
over a majority of the newsgroups.
''While it is an appealing concept to
reach the broadest possible audience,
imagine if you will, the bliss you would
be in if you could speak into the mind of
every person on the planet. Pretty snazzy,
eh? Now imagine that everyone has this
ability and uses it to sell you insurance,
lip gloss, and shoe spray, Would you ever
be able to sleep again? How long before
you go insane?
''We have television channels so we
can choose what to watch. We have news-
America Online, the nation's third
largest online service, offers access to
Usenet. Because of it's simple interface
and relative ease of use, America Online
has a reputation for attracting users with
less regard for-or perhaps knowledge
of-netiquette. On news.admin.golics, the
merest mention of AOL causes some to
grumble.
''Most of the spammers from AOL
are simply users who are excited at the
prospect of using this great tool and who
aren't aware of the 'rules of the road'
when it comes to posting,'' explained
David O'Donnell, AOL's system adminis-
trator. ''We go to great lengths to educate
our members on what the Internet and
Usenet are, their conventions, and histori-
cal guidelines.''
''Because AOL is one of the largest
sites on the Internet, we have a propor-
tionally greater exposure in terms of users
and notoriety,'' O'Donnell maintained.
''Abusers can be characterized into three
groups: the ignorant and usually acciden-
tal abuser, the commercial abuser, and the
deliberate abuser. The majority of abuse
by our members falls into the first two
categories. Our current educational efforts
are helping address the issues of igno-
periods of time when the trend has
reversed, like during the Christmas sea-
son, It hasn't dropped as much as I would
like, but we're working on some ways to
help acclimate our members to being on
the Usenet, which I think will help the
trend continue downward,''
Will spambots and cancelbots
become the norm on Usenet? Hopefully
not. In time, more sophisticated news dis-
tribution and newsreading software
should stop the problem at its source.
Until then, education of new Internet
users will have to suffice. Unfortunately,
some of us do not wish to be educated but
would rather exploit the Internet's
resources like so much clear-cutting of
virgin forest. The voices may never let
you sleep again. ss

HOME-REMODELING DIARY
allowances, or budgets, for certain
items are realistic.
It's a hard decision, Each has good
references. When pressed, some ref-
erences mention being unhappy with
one contractor's slowness in finishing
up the last bit of work. But we decide
to go with that guy anyway: His work-
manship looks good, he has more
experience and, perhaps most impor-
tant, he's building a strong reputation
in our small community.
EARLY NOVEMBER:
WE EIGN THE CONTEACT
The contractor goes back to his sub-
contractors for final, hard numbers.
GContract price: $51,260. At the same
time Guy files a set of plans with the
city to apply for a building permit, a
process that could take several weeks.
Eyen though the contractor keeps
saying he'll be happy to give me
proof of his liability insurance and
license, I haven't seen the documents
yet. We won't sign a contract without
them, and I don't want another delay,
so I call the contractors' licensing sec-
tion of the Virginia Department of
Professional and Occupational Regu-
lation to confirm his license number
and the expiration date. Everything
checks out.
While I'm at it, I call the contrac-
tor's insurance company. A Tepresen-
tative confirms that his liability insur-
ance is in effect and offers to send me
a ''binder'' letter stating so.
Finally, we sign the contract, a
standard American Institute of Archi-
tects document provided by the
builder, We amend it a bit to accom-
modate our lack of an archhitect, and
make a note on the payment sched-
ule that says the ''draw,' or payment
timetable, is approximate and that
payments will be based on comple-
tion of work, The contract gives the
builder five months to finish work,
though he expects to finishh sooner.
(Weather can cause big delays.) We
sign a check for $6,500, roughly 13
of the contract price, and hand over a
set of keys.
The contractor pulls the building
permit and pays the $195 fee.
Because he pulled the permit, he is
now responsible for completing the
job and getting final inspections,
We set up a special checking
account solely to keep track of con-
struction expenditures. We'll have to
save copies of the contract and
receipts practically forever so we can
adjust our tax basis and minimize tax-
es if we ever sell the house.
LATE NOVEMBER.
DiET FLIEE
Just before Thanksgiving, stakes with
orange flags appear in the backyard,
marking the perimmeter of the new
foundation. A few days later,''Buddy''
arrives at dawn with his Bobcat and
starts digging. When he's done, the
hole looks incredibly small.
After an unusually dry autumn, it
starts to rain. The contractor glibly
refers to the newly dug hole, which is
smack against our basement founda-
tion, as ''the swimming pool.'' Plastic
tarps help prevent the new hole from
a design/build contractor,
but the quality of such
contractors' design

Most people should need rough-
1e 709 to no more than 90 of pre-
retirement gross income to maitntain
rity taxes owed, too. On the other
hand, health care costs tend to rise.
The higher your preretirement
income, the greater the proportion
of that income you will tend to need
after retirement and the more
you'll have to rely on pensions and
savings. That's because social securi-
ty replaces a much smaller propor-
tion of high earners' incomes and
because with a higher income,
you'll still be paying hefty taxes.

USIUDAECESEE
THERE'S BEEN NO DRAMA on the page-
layout-software scene for a while now, but a
recently introduced program from Ger-
many piqued our interest. For years, DTP
titans PageMaker and QuarkXPress have
been chewing up and spitting out any rival
program that dared step into the limelight.
so when Interpress Technologies debuted
VivaPress Professional, we held our breath.
Although we found that the program boasts
several noteworthy features, its seriously
marred by an ill-conceived interface and
several poorly implemented tools.
The Big Picture
VivaPress Pro takes the same frame-based
approach to layout as QuarkXPress. You
draw frames, called objects in VivaPress-
speak, when you want to enter or import
graphics and text (imports are courtesy of
Claris' XTND technology). Unlike Quark-
XPress, however, which makes you switch
between separate tools for text and graphic
frames, VivaPress Pro uses a single tool.
Once youve created an object frame,you
assign it text, graphic, or picture attributes.
The program is flexible in that it lets you
change an objects attribute at any time.
Thats the good news, The bad news is that
theres no easy way to accessVivaPress Pros
object-creation tool - a key command or a
toggle on the text palette that switched you
to object mode would be a helpful addition.
VivaPress Pros most powerful feature is
the ability to create alias objects, which are
great time-savers if you want to use recur-
ring elementsindependentof master pages.
Similar to a Finder alias, an alias object
serves as a pointer to an original text or
graphic object.When you make a change to
the original object, all the aliases change
accordingly. Alias objects really shine when
you use them withthe programs spiffy Split
command, which chops objects up into
user-defined pieces, Each piece can be des-
ignated as an alias and linked to the current
text chain.
We werentas impressed with alias pages.
VivaPress Pros answer to master pages, A
bug prevents you from deleting objects cre-
ated on alias pages -- to getrid of an object,
you must first delete it from a document
page and then remove itfrom the alias page.
One of the whizzier features in VivaPress
Pro is the ability to add Bezier curves to ir-
regularly shaped objects by holding down
the Option key when you click on a selection
point - a useful feature for creating cus-
tom text blocks, picture shapes, and simple
graphic elements. You can also edit Adobe
Illustrator and Macromedia FreeHand ob-
jects from within VivaPress Pro, although
we found this feature buggy and slow, even
when running the program native on a
Power Mac.
VivaPress Pros style sheets outclass the
competitions'in several ways,The program
lets you create style sheets for graphics as
well as for text,and you can apply text style
sheets to individual characters,Style sheets
are only as good as a programs formatting
features, however, and because VivaPress
Pros formatting suffers from several short-
comings, including the inability to apply
rules to paragraphs, the style sheets suffer
accordingly.
On the surface, VivaPress Pros typo-
graphic controls seem robust, but closer
scrutiny shows some limitations. The pro-
gram has several typographiccontrols built
in that PageMaker and QuarkXPress offer
only through plug-in modules. For exam-
ple, you can define tracking and kerning
settings as document preferences. The
tracking controls are much like Page-
Makers, although you can specify only one
track per font at five sizes whereas Page-
Maker lets you assign five tracks per font at

the ConcertWare experience. Other annoyances include a lack of resolution smaller than a
32nd and the lack of a reference card for the plethora of keyboard command equivalents.
Although ConcertWare is an affordable and reasonably capable notation program,it suf-
fers from an ancient interface. Entry-level musicians and hobbyists may find ConcertWare
adequate, if they're short on cash and long on patience. If your time is valuable, save your
money for a higher-priced,more intuitive package. ! Christopher Breen

MAC CLONES
was not ready to test for this issue. For comparison, we also tested
three Power Macs: a 7100/80, an 8100/100, and an 8100/110.
The three clones performed pretty much as you would expect
from systems that differ technically from their Mac counterparts
only in modest ways, We first ran our core suite of MacBench 2.0
tests. Based on extensive profiling of the top-selling Mac applica-
tions, MacBench is a standard for comparing the speed of the four
major subsystems - processor, floating-point, disk, and video -
of machines that run the Mac OS. MacBench numbers provide data
on the relative speed of Macs being used for typical business tasks.
Not surprisingly, in the Processor and Floating Point tests, the
clones performed identically to Power Macs that contained the
same-speed PowerPC processors, The Disk Mi test is sensitive to
the particular drive mechanism and software driver being tested.
Although Apples Power Macs scored better on this test than the
Power 100 and the Radius System 100, it
would be unfair to conclude that Macs in
general have better disk-subsystem speed
than clones, For example, the Power 100 we
tested didn'thave a drive comparable to that
in the Power Mac8100/100 to which we com-
pared it. In the case of the Radius System
100, the drive for which we show Disk Mis
test results is the internal 540-MB drive,
which we compared to the high-speed inter-
nal 2-GB drive of the Power Mac 8100/110.
The Radius System 100, however, also
contains a high-speed 2-GB drive, con-
nected to a Fast and Wide SCSI-2 NuBus
card. We used this drive for performing a
series of disk-intensive Photoshop tests.
Unlike most Mac applications, which read
and write data in relatively small blocks,
Photoshop moves data to and from a hard
diskin verylarge blocks.It was in these tests
that the custom drive in the Radius System
100 excelled, shoveling data to and from the computer nearly 43
percent faster than the Power Macs drive.
In the Video Mix test, the only surprise was the poor showing of
the Thunder IV GX<1600, the cream of Radius' graphics-displayl
accelerated-video-adapter crop. Again, however, its important to
realize that the MacBench Video Mi test is based on typical busi-
ness-application tasks. This test provides a good measure of the
overall snappiness of the Mac interface - entering data, typing,
pulling down menus, clicking on buttons in dialog boxes, and the
like. This is not the type of work graphics-displaylaccelerated-
video adapters are designed to enhance. When we did a series of
Photoshop image-manipulation tasks (Unsharp Mask, Gaussian
Blur,and Rotate),specialized routines handled by DSP chips on the
Thunder IV card kicked in. In these tests, the Radius System 100
outpaced Apples top-of-the-line Power Mac by 30 percent.

hanging indent counterintuitive. (In case its new to

Representatives for Paramount, Group W
and Multimedia said that the distributors plan
to stick with the shows through the May sweeps.
But station reps say the prognosis is not good,
particularly in light of the recent cancellations
of Buena Vista Television's Judge For Yourself
(1A) and MCAs Suzanne Sommers (9).
Greg Nathanson, vp/general manager of
KTLA in Los Angeles, says that the May
sweeps is the ''gut-check time'' for distributors
and stations who still hold out hope that today's
talk dud could be tomorrow's Jenny Jones, ''If
you looked atJennyJones'ratings, it should have
been canceled after the first season, but Warner
that storm better than the others,'' Meidel says.
Garnett Losak, associate program director
for the Blair Television rep firm, notes that fail-
ure rates for new syndicated shows often top S0
percent. But Losak says that the high level of
failures among talk shows this season has been
dismaying. ''It was not a particularly strong sea-
son for any of the new talk shows,'' Loszak says.
'The only reason why Gordon has survived is
because it has stayed with the relationship-,
issue-oriented format that has served Ricki,Jen-
ny, Montel andJery so well. These other fresh-
man strips strayed from that course, going out

which has not served them well.''

The thought makes both MSOs and their potential
content partners drool. ''Cable modems are here today,'
says Thomas Turley, Jr., America Online's assistant man-
ager for multimedia and new technology services. ''We
have hundreds of people using them right now in their
homes.'' Hewlett-Packard, Intel, LAN City and Zenith
were all here showing off hardware, and AOIL and Prodi-
gy eagerly demonstrated the sorts of multimedia services
they'll be able to offer once cable modems reach their four
million-odd subscribers a year from now. NBC's AOL
site, for instance, was showing real-time clips of Jurassic
Park and other upcoming network programming. ''We
have it stored on a server,' Turley said happily, envision-
ing a blessed end to the online services' text-
and-graphics click-and-wait era. 'Just hit Play
and it pulls it off the server.'' Asked what cable
modem services will cost, however, Turley
hedged. ''Cost in our business plan hasn't come
up at all,'' he said.
Over in the Hewlett-Packard booth, Jeff
Hornung offered a few hints. Hornung, HP's
marketing manager for interactive broadband
products, spoke with the calm authority of a
businessman who knows he's on the right side
of history. '''96,'' he said,''will be the year cable
modems take off,'' HP's second-generation
product, shipping next year, ''will hit the
required price point of $400. Every operator
says,'That's great, but we want to pay $200.' But
our research shows there's a compelling value
proposition at $400. That's the range that
works.'' HP will also offer cable operators a
suite of services for local content, network
management and billing services.'An operator
can say, 'I want a turnkey service,' said Hor-
nung, ''and we'll provide that. We'll design it,
deliver it, install it and support it, Other people
are doing it with alliances. Starting early 1996,
we can do it ourselves.'' HP he said, is''looking
to do actual deployments, not trials, We're cur-
rently talking with cable operators,'' he said,
and ''we hope to make some major announce-
ments later this year with a number of MSOs.''

''Two years ago,' said Mundie,''I'd come to
this show and the only thing people wanted to
its squadron of Thunderbolts threw their
weight into a tank battle between Amer-
ican Shermans and 16 German Tigers
near Wald. When the battle was over, the
unexpected air scourge had knocked out
six German tanks and caused the 10 other
Tigers to flee.
Next came the Rhine River. By cross-
ing it, the U.S. Ninth Army would com-
pletely isolate the Ruhr, Germanys rich-
est industrial area. New names of German
cities appeared in the daily target brief-
ings, Recklinhausen, Dortmund, Essen,
Hamm, Soest, Paderborn-all were
struck from the air. Thousands of tons of
rolling railroad stock were destroyed per
week. Ruhr factories became islands of
smokestacks and ruined buildings.
By March 12, 1945, sorties against
rolling stock in the Ruhr were flown from
German soil itself. On that day, XXIC
TAC became the first American tactical
air command to fly a mission complete
from briefing to interrogation from
German soil. That was when the 373rd
Fighter Group began to operate from a
German airfield, built in 1941 by Dutch
slave labor, just one week after its capture
by American armor.
Pilots returning from their last mission
over the Ruhr commented on the devas-
tation there: ''Germany has a permanent
flame in the Ruhr. It's impossible to see
the ground,''''We were over the Ruhr for
two hours from north to south. All we saw
in the way of targets was one motorcycle.
The whole territory looks dead.''
By March 23, 1945, the day the Ninth
Army troops crossed the Rhine River and
established the Wesel-Orsoy bridgehead
into the heart of Germany, the GIs were
asking ''Where is the Lufhuaffe?'' Indeed,
the decimation of the Luftuaffe in the air
and on the ground had progressed relent-
lessly. The Luftuaffe had either been
buried in the wreckage of its own hangars
or shot to shreds over its own air bases
after attacks by XCXID TAC Thunder-
bolts. In the eight days preceding the U.S.
Armys crossing of the Rhine, General
Nugent's planes had immobilized 423
enemy aircraft in a series of concerted
raids on derman bases.
On March 20, one group alone, the
373rd again, destroyed or damaged 119
enemy aircraft on the ground without
losing a single plane. A star performer of
the day was lst Lt, Edward B. Edwards,
who destroyed three unkers Ju-8Ss and
damaged nine Messerschmitt Bf-1094,
dropping two 500-pounders and making
a dozen strafng passes.
In five lightning attacks against Luft-
uaffe bases at Gutersloh, Paderborn and
Lippstadt the same day, P-47 Thunder-
bolts of Colonel Anthony V. Grosettas
406th Fighter Group destroyed more than
25 enemy aircraft on the ground and set
fire to at least 12 hangars and buildings.
Neck, Frescott was joined by lsrael Futnams men, who brought
fascines (bundles of small branches woven together and placed
to absorb some of the impact of cannonballs), picks and shov-
els, and empty hogsheads to be filled with soil and used to form
walls for a fort.
At this time, Prescott called a meeting of senior officers, a
group including Putnam and Colonel Richard Gridley. Trescott
told them his orders were to defend Bunker Hill. After a
lengthy discussion, the group decided Breed's Hill was a better
position, Closer to Boston, it commanded any approach from
the south and could serve as a buffer for Bunker Hill. On the
debit side, it would be more exposed to enemy fire.
Like all committee decisions, this one was a compromise and
as such it had weaknesses.
Trescott occupied that part of Breeds Hill where Gridley had
laid out the lines for a square redoubt stretching 152 feet on
each side. The Colonials began digging about midnight. They
had four hours before daylight, and then the defenses could be
seen from the British warships in Boston Harbor. Presumably,
Futnam was present at the redoubt, pressing his men to dig
quickly and deep. Just the day before,he had told Ward,''Ameri-
cans are not at all afraid for their heads, though very much
afraid for their legs; if you cover them they will fight forever.''
At 3 a,m. Futnam rode back to Wards headquarters in Cam-
bridge to seek reinforcements.
As the digging continued on Breed's Hill, Prescott ordered
Captain Hugh Maswell of his Massachusetts regiment to join
Captain John Nuttings detachment in Charlestown, where
they could patrol the shores to protect against British landing
parties, Prescott personally scouted the shoreline twice before
dawn. In the harbor, from north to south, lay the 14-gun sloop
Falcon, the 20-gun frigate Lively and the 20-gun Glasgou. Lead-
ing the flotilla was the formidable 64-gun ship of the line Som-
erset, a bit farther out. Hearing no activity on the ships, Frescott
returned to the Breeds Hill redoubt. Light was just beginning
to reach the horizon.
The 49-year-old Prescott was more than 6 feet tall and strong
of mind and body. Cast in the mold of a good officer, self-pos-
sessed with a natural air of command, he was determined yet
kind; he commanded respect but was not domineering. For his
coolness and courage under fire in the Battle of Louisbourg
during King deorge's War in 1745, Prescott had been offered
a regular commission in the British army but had instead re-
turned to his farm in Fepperell, Mass.
When conflict with England appeared inevitable in 1775,
he raised a regiment of Minutemen but arrived at Concord too
late for the fghting there and at nearby lLexington. Now, as he
stood on the redoubt with the first light of dawn breaking over
the Mystic River, the guns of HMS Lively opened fire, then
strangely fell silent. Prescott used the lull to begin work on a
breastwork 100 yards long that would reach from the southeast
corner of the redoubt to the marsh below.
While Prescott was setting his defenses, the British generals
were still bickering in boston. Clinton proposed an immediate
attack on the Charlestown Peninsula: Howe would make a
frontal attack from the east, while Clinton with 500 men would
land just south of the Neck and behind the redoubt to cut off
Prescotts force. The other generals opposed Clintons plan be-
cause it put the British force between the Americans on the
peninsula and those on the mainland. Clinton later wrote that
Gage ''thought himself so well informed that he would not
take any opinion of others, particularly of a man bred in the
German school, which that of America affects to despise.''
Howe then proposed that Breeds Hill be cut off with a frontal
attack by pinning down the defenders while an enveloping
force attacked from the Mystic River to the rear. dage approved
of Howe's plan. And that plan might have succeeded if Howe
had not chosen Moulton's Point to land his troops. The tide
there delayed his assault.
The Colonials, tired, hungry and thirsty in the 80-degree
heat, were delighted that the British decided to delay the at-
tack. The decision gave the defenders time to continue their
preparation for Howe's command, which was led by 10 veteran
light infantry companies and 10 veteran grenadier companies.
All in all, Howe would lead a force of 1,500 infantry and 12
guns in barges from Boston at noon, with Brig. Gen. Sir Robert
Figot second-in-command. To be held in reserve were 700 in-
fantry of the 4 th and 65rd regiments and elements of the lst
and 2nd battalions of marines. The plan was sound and might
have been carried through, except for the six-hour delay caused
by the tide. An earlier attack would have given the landing
forces room to maneuver toward both Breed's and Bunker hills.
As it was, the delay not only gave the Americans time to im-
prove their defenses but also cost the British maneuvering room
and the ability to concentrate their attack.
When Lively began her bombardment, Futnam awoke from
his sleep and rode off toward Breeds Hill to reinforce Prescotts
small force. Fifty-seven years old inn 1775, Putnam was already
a hero of English-speaking Colonial America. Born in Salem
Village (now Danvers), Mass., Futnam was a farmboy, and
though he had little schooling, he soon learned the ways of the
woods, At the outbreak of the French and Indian War in 1754,
he joined the Connecticut forces and was made a lieutenant.
lLater he joined Rogers' Rangers, named after its famous leader,
Robert Rogers, Futnam became renowned for his exploits,
Once he rescued a band of English soldiers from their Indian
captors, Another time, he escaped capture by shooting the
rapids of a dangerous river. After the war, Futnam returned to
his farm. In 1775 he was working in his fields when he heard
enemy lines and activities such as am-
bush and cutting enemy supply lines,
During the Vietnam War that lasted until
the 1970s, 0he Navy SEAL units served
with great distinction. The Communist
Viet Cong had made great strides by ter-
rorizing and murdering the South Viet-
namese. Then the SEALs, called ''The
Men Wih Green Faces'' because of their
camouflage, turned the tables on the guer-
rillas and their Noorth Vietnamese allies
with search-and-destroy patrols deep into
the rear areas. The SEALs terrorized the
terrorists, using tactics such as staging
raids on Viet Cong guerrilla funerals.
The SEALs served with great distinc-
tion in ''Nam'' and left a record of great
successes. As most SEALs will proudly
tell you, ''The United States and South
Vietnam lost their war, we won ours,''
Three of the SEALs who served in Viet-
nam received the Medal of Honor.
The men of the highly skilled special
combat force like to brag, ''We can go
anywhere and do anything we wish,''and
this often has proved to be the case. They
have been in the forefront of just about
every U.S. military operation since Viet-
nam. The SEAL units, which absored the
oold UDT forces, were first at Granada,
at fanama and in the Desert Storm cam-
paign. Their record is one of heroism,
pride and accomplishment. And their
museum at Fort Pierce shows the public
why they enjoy such prestige.
With displays depicting the entire his-
tory of this special unit, the museum is lo-
cated at the center of a parklike area.
Housed there is the often deadly equipage
the UDT/SEAL members have used in
more than half a century of service to the
country. You will see ''gadgets'' used to
where torpedoes were suspected. It is not
known whether any of the prisoners were
killed as a result,
During the 1864 bombardment of
Charleston by Federal warships, a Con-
federate officer decided to emulate But-
lers Dutch Gap measure. Soon 48 Union
prisoners were housed in the city within
range of their own artillery. One of them,
Brig. Gen. Charles A. Heckman, later re-
ported that Brig. Gen. John G. Foster put
an end to that caper very quickly, Wrote
Heckman, ''Foster ordered down from
Johnson's Island 5 Confederate generals,
15 colonels, 15 lieutenant colonels, and
15 majors''and exposed them to fire from
guns of Charleston's defenders.
Although Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant
had ordered a halt to exchange of prison-
ers by that time, those sets of hostages
were soon swapped. As a result, Confed-
erate enthusiasm quickly took a new di-
rection. If hostages under fire could be ex-
changed for officers in gray, why not go
about it wholesale! Because of transpor-
tation problems, their plan to bring train-
loads of captured Federals to Charleston
proved futile and was abandoned. Union
officers at Hilton Head, however, who
knew what was brewing, failed to learn
that the scheme had been aborted.
Almost 600 Confederate prisoners,
most of them from ohnson's Island,
Ohio, were hurriedly shipped south. Early
in September, those prisoners were put in
a stockade on Morris Island and were
guarded by black soldiers, Federal leaders
reasoned that their presence on the island
would deter Fort Sumter's gunners from
firing at fortifications on the island.
During a period of six weeks, the Con-
federate hostages dropped to the ground
many times a day when they heard the
whistling of shells. Only one hostage
died, however, and in October most of
them were moved to safety and relative
comfort at Fort Pulaski, Ga.
Scores of incidents caused at least 1,000
Americans to become hostages during the
Civil War, but accounts of that special
kind of warfare must be discovered one by
one in the course of research. The exist-
ing records are so scanty that in many in-
stances arrests are recorded but releases
are not. Hence, no one knows how many
of these pawns in the North/South power
struggle went to their deaths.
It is certain, however, that Union
hostage-taking elevated 600 Confederate
officers to a unique status, Borrowing from
the lore of Balaklava, scene of Alfred
Lord Tennyson's ''Charge of the Light
Brigade,'' Confederates labeled hostages
who survived for six weeks under con-
stant fire as ''The Immortal 600.'' No
other band of Civil War soldiers, North
or South, fighting in major battles or
jailed as hostages, were honored by a
comparable title. d:

wHAT IS THE PRICE OF CIVIC PRIDE?
How about 147%? But only if you carrya
balance on your Hometown MasterCard.
Just when you thought credit-card
companies had run out of gimmicks,
you and your neighbors have become
targets for the latest version of affinity
cards, As defined within the industry.
affinity cards are associated with
schools, clubs or charitable organiza-
tions and offer cash rebates or other ben-
efits to the sponsor-based on the
cardholder's spending-rather than to
the cardholder. The card pushers have
convinced several cash-strapped cities
that such cards can be a dependable
source of revenue to help politicians
keep a lid on taxes. These cards are not
restricted to local residents, though they
may have little appeal for nonlocals,
who can usually get better credit terms
from a standard card.
Plano, Texas pioneered the concept
with its card in 1991 and has since been
joined by dozens of other cities, includ-
ing Lebanon, Pa., Person County. N.C.
and Porterville, Calif. South Orange.
N.[. began offering its card last Novem-
ber. Since then Mayor William R. Cal-
abrese has become a popular guy.

sity) is a typical card-carrying commu-
nity Thus far, there are some 800 hold-
ers of its no-fee MasterCard emblazoned

The interest rate on the card is 147%,

age (1796%). It returns 1% of all charged
amounts to South Orange's municipal
coffers, and by late March had generated
$11,000 for the town. South Orange will
use this year's proceeds to improve the
downtown area, including refurbishing
the facades of existing stores and subsi-
dizing the rents of new merchants. The
subsidies could yield tasty dividends.
Calabrese says two bakers have applied
for the subsidy in order to move into
empty storefronts Currently, South Or-
ange has no downtown bakery
South Orange's card looks like a good
deal for the town and cardholders, but
that's not always the case. So if you're
considering such a card, watch out for
these two affinity-card pitfalls:
YHigh rates. So far, rates on the com-
munity cards range from 11.5% to 16%.
But many other affinity cards have
rates as high as 12 points over prime,
says Robert B. McKinley. president of
RAM Research, and annual fees up to
$35. Of course, you can avoid high-
interest charges if you pay off your bal-
ance each month.
LoW sponsor income. Sponsor income
isoften as low as 0.5% of your charges. So
make sure that the return your town
earns justifies the higher interest you
might pay You could be better off''keep-
ing your old card and writing a check to

a contribution to civic improvement,

Retirement CDs offer more than f%-plus headaches
lf you think C-D spells ''safety,'' you're not alone-and don't worry, you're not Dan
Ouayle. Certificates of deposit get insured by the Federal Deposit lnsurance Corpo-
ration in accounts up to $1oo,ooo. That security blanket partly accounts for the
heightened interest in a new retirement CD being marketed by 11 banks nationwide.
Like annuities, these products earn tax-deferred returns until you retire, and then
they pay out monthly income. But unlike annuities, they are covered by the FDIC.
Retirement CDs are offered with interest-rate periods of up to five years and
must be reinvested until your retirement date. The current rates are better than
the national CD average-6.6g% on a five-year CD. The bank currently paying the
best initial five-year rate on retirement CDs is Blackfeet National Bank in Brown-
ing, Mont. (4o6-338-7ooo) at 7.25%.
But the retirement CD security blanket has two holes. First, the bank could es-
tablish subsequent rates below market levels. Reason: You can't transfer your de-
posit to another bank without paying taxes and penalties. Secondly, CD rates
aren't likely to allow you to live well during retirement; you probably would be
better off with a stock-based annuity.
Alltold,a retirement CD is a viable option only if you're close to retirement-say,
five years-and you're looking for a safe place to stash your cash. -Duff McDonald

eral government. The minimum income needed to
meet these government standards ranges from a
mere $7,363 for singles to $14,763 for a family of
fourto$29.529 for a family of nine or more.
Beyond these insufficient incomes, what unites
America's poor is a set of stereotyped images that
blend fact with myth. Three major assumptions
are largely true:
kThe poor are less educated than other Ameri-
cans. Only 56% of poor household heads are high
school graduates, compared with 81% of all house-
hold heads.
) Most of the poor don't work. Only 9% of poor
working-age adults work full time, year round,
compared with 42%of allworking-age adults; 40%
of the poor do work part time or part of the year,
compared with 69%of all adults.
O Most of the poor live in single-parent house-
holds headed by women. [ust over half of the poor
families (52%) in America are headed by single fe-
males, compared withonly 18%of all U.S. families.
But four other typical characterizations are
largely false:
)The poor have too many kids. The average poor
family receiving AFDC consists of 2.9 people. The
typical American family:3.2people.
Y Most of the poor live in inner-clty ghettos.
Only about one in eight poor Americans lives in
censustractswith poverty rates of 40% or higher.
) Most of the poor are black. Although blacks are
overrepresented among the poor, whites make up
67% of America's poor, compared with 83% of the
overall population. Blacks, who represent 13% of
the population, make up 29% of the poor. The
blackratio has barely budged since the mid-1960s.
k Poverty is a lifelong affliction. Studies show
that while about a third of the poor are elderly or
disabled and thus unlikely toclimb out of poverty
one of every five poor people in a given year isn't
poor the following year. IsabelV Sawhill, a senior

Thcir optimism gives me hope.
O: You think the spirit of youthful opti-
mism will let todays kids rise above the
violence on the streets?
A: Ys, and rise above the oblique and
direct negligence.
Q: Meaning?
A: When the human race neglects its
weaker members, when the family
neglects its weakest one-its the first
blow in a suicidal movement. I see the
neglect in cities around the country, in
poor white children in West Virginia and
Virginia and Kentucky--in the big cities,
too, for that matter. I see the neglect of
Native American children in the concen-
tration camps called reservations.

your bootstraps'' But they don't really
believe that those living on denuded
reservations, or on strip-mined hills, or
in ghettos that are destinations for drugs
from Colombia and Iraq, can somehow
pull themselves up. What they're really
saying is, ''If you can, do, but if you cant,
forget it.'' Its the most pernicious of all
acts of segregation, because it is so subtle.

Kenzaburo Oe for his almost painful

his unqualified love and beautiful writing.

they cant read, period.
A: Well, we recover-and this sounds
almost preachy-by each one, teach one.
Or, each one, teach ten. Elimination of
illiteracy is as serious an issue to our his-
tory as the abolition of slavery
Q: The importance of literacy in schools
often gets less attention than the controversy
over prayer in schools. Should a prayerful
moment be a part of school curricula?
A: I think so. Students who don't want
to pray don't have to and shouldn't, but a
moment of silence to focus on something
is a good thing. Those who don't want to
focus on the ''unnameable'' can think
about their roller skates or maybe-

Basically. a guy I know and grew up with named Bubba.
Bubba listens to Limbaugh because Limbaugh gives him
someone to blame for the fact that Bubba is getting screwed.
Hes working harder, getting paid less in constant dollars and
falling further and further behind. Not only is Bubba never
gonna be able to buy a house, he can barely afford a trailer.
Hell, he can barely afford the payments on the pickup.
And because Bubba understands hes being shafted, even if
he doesn't know why or how or by whom, he listens to Lim-
baugh. Limbaugh offers him scapegoats. Its the ''feminazis'' Its
the minorities. Its the limousine liberals. Its all these people
with all these wacky social programs to help some silly, self-
proclaimed bunch of victims. Bubba feels like a victim him-
self-and he is-but he never got any sympathy from liberals.
Psychologists often tell us there is a great deal of displaced
anger in our emotional lives-your dad wallops you, but hes
too big to hit back, so you go clobber your little brother. Dis-
placed anger is also common in our political life. We see it in
this generation of young white men without much education
and very little future. This economy no longer has a place for
them. The corporations have moved their jobs to Singapore.
Unfortunately, it is Limbaugh and the Republicans who are
addressing the resentments of these folks, and aiming their
anger in the wrong direction.
In my state, I have not seen so much hatred in politics since
the heyday of the John Birch Society in the early 196os. Used to
be you couldn't talk politics with a conservative without his
getting all red in the face, arteries standing out in his neck,
wattles aquiver with indignation-just like a pissed-off turkey
gobbler. And now we're seeing the same kind of anger again.
FARNESS SE ACCURACY N REPORTING, THE ORGANIzATION THAT
provided the absurd Limbaughisms that you see to the right,
has a sweet, gentle faith that truth will triumph in the end,
and thinks it is sufficient to point out that Limbaugh is wrong.
I say its important to point out that hes not just wrong but
that hes ridiculous, one of the silliest people in America. Sure,
it takes your breath away when he spreads some false and
vicious rumor, such as the story that Vincent Fosters body was
actually discovered in an apartment owned by Hillary Clinton.
Or when he destroys an important lobby-control bill by falsely
claiming that it would make the average citizen subject to lob-
bying laws. Yes, thats sick and perverse.
But its important to show people that there is much more
wrong with Limbaughs thinking than just his facts. Limbaugh
specializes in ad hominem arguments, which are themselves
ridiculously easy to expose. Ted Kennedy says, '7merica needs
health care reform'' Limbaugh replies, 'Ted Kennedy is fat''
Rush Limbaughs pathetic abuse of logic, his absurd pompos-
ity, his relentless self-promotion, his ridiculous ego-now
those, friends, are appropriate targets for satire.

''Now wait a minute,' Helms says. ''The report last night was
flat-out, and I have been trying to trace it, and I am told the
Associated Press moved it and then pulled it back. Im not sure
about that. I have only a report from the British Broadcasting
Corporation, which has various statements made by President
Zedillo, and we are attempting to ascertain what the facts are''
Something sinister is going on south of the border, Helms
seems to suggest, and he is going to get to the bottom of it.
Moments later, his aides give reporters the BBC story which
quotes Zedillo as saying he will accept no loan conditions that
will ''undermine Mexican sovereignty'' It is the kind of thing a
politician says to allay nationalist fears-not, as Helms
implied, an outright refusal to negotiate repayment terms.
It is a classic Helms maneuver. The Mexican loan package is
complex, but the senator has sidetracked the entire debate by
turning a nonfact into a central issue. ''No conditions''
becomes a refrain throughout the hearing, creating a false
impression of Mexican deadbeats trying to get something for
nothing from American taxpayers. Weintraub spends the rest
of the morning on the defensive, refuting something that no
one had any reason to believe was true in the first place.
1NNUEN D O AN D D iVERS1O N
AFTER NEARLY A OUARTER CENTURY IN THE SENATE, HELMS UNDER-
stands how a determined minority of one can influence the
national agenda. Whether he is suggesting that the comman-
der in chief needs a bodyguard or demanding that Fidel Castro
leave Cuba ''in a vertical or horizontal position,' Helms is
well-known for his use of innuendo and diversion. Even the
Republican Party treats him as a rogue elephant, powerful yet
dangerously erratic. But the recent GOP stampede has given
Helms a respected position from which to trumpet his bitter
opposition to abortion, gay rights, racial equality arts funding,
and aid to what he calls ''foreign rat holes.''
His agenda is driven by a lifelong opposition to democracy
and diversity In his first months as Foreign Relations chair,
Helms called for tougher sanctions against Cuba, accused Hait-
ian President Jean Bertrand Aristide of unleashing ''vigilance
committees,' and moved to gut support for developing nations.
On the home front, he introduced a bill to eliminate all affir-
mative action programs, which he denounced as ''reverse dis-
crimination at the hands of ruthless bureaucrats''
How did someone so mean-spirited end up in a position to
act on his divisive politics? For the most part, Helms wins
political battles by keeping the spotlight on the morality plays
he stages. To hear conservatives tell it, Helms is a personal
friend of esus Christ, a populist defender of the little guy and
a bitter opponent of big government.
Shifting the spotlight reveals a different Helms. A former
bank lobbyist whose fundraising machine has been fined for
breaking federal campaign laws, Helms favors a big-spending,
activist government-one that aids those in economic power.
He voted to bail out the savings and loan industry for exam-
ple, and has seldom met a big-ticket missile system he didn't
like. By contrast, he has voted to slash school lunches for
impoverished children, medical care for disabled veterans, pre-
scription drugs for the elderly, and wages for working families
(see ''On the record,' below).
''Looking at the record, people ought to understand that
Helms is not representing them on the great majority of issues,'
says Rep. Melvin Watt, a North Carolina Democrat. ''They per-
ceive that he stands up for the little guy but he really stands up
for rich people rather than poor and working-class people''

ding them to have daily Mass. Doubt-
less in the old days many of Vietnam's
Catholic elite might have deserved to
be brought down a peg or two. Today,
however, the Church is completely dis-
possessed and yet even more of a chal-
lenge to the government.
St. Joseph's Cathedral tells the tale
in sad grey walls representing fifty
years of neglect. Mass is permitted
only twice a day, at 5:30 A.M. and P.M.,
but the Sunday service we attended
was packed, and the papers reported
that on Christmas Eve there were
overflow crowds. As I pass the statue
of Our Lady in its very sorry state, I
nonetheless suspect that for all its tri-
als the Cross will remain in Vietnam
long after the hammer and sickle have
become a footnote.
On my last day here, I make the
round of the art galleries. In Hong
Kong, where I live, Vietnamese artists
are quite popular and the prices have
escalated accordingly. Most prominent
of these is the late Bui Xuan Phai,
whose street scenes of Hanoi suggest
Degas and whose works go for about
three times those of any other Viet-
namese artist. Alas, the world's discov-
ery of Vietnamese art is having two
economic consequences. The first is a
booming business in fake Phais; he
seems to have produced more in the 7
years after he died than in the 67
years he was alive. The other is an ex-
plosion of bad art. In a nation where
average annual income is $210 and a
painting can easily fetch $300, more
and more people are discovering the in-
ner artist in themselves.
In an upstairs gallery, the young
women all speak excellent English. We
chat about America and the opportuni-
ties in Vietnam these days, and as they
roll up a purchase, I decide to ask
about the imprisoned Dr. ue.
After conferring with one another in
Vietnamese, they turn to me. ''He is in-
volved with democracy and human
rights?'' one asks.
I admitted this was so.
''That is not a good thing to be in-
volved in here.''

cover them in the much broader realm
of inquiry that we might call meta-
physics. Of course, there is something
in the insights thus offered; it is simply
the claim of their omnicompetence that
looks like overkill. Characteristically,
such schemes present a simple and ap-
pealing pattern of explanation which
seems flexible enough to fit many
cases. Evolution through the competi-
tion to survive is like that; so is the
Hegelian dialectic of thesis and an-
tithesis leading to synthesis. Once one
has got the hang of such a pattern, it is
rather easy to twist things into that
pleasing shape. Once one knows that
survival value is the key, then of
course there must be a lot of survival
value around. Ideas become self-ful5ll-
ing. This leads to those conjectured
tales which Stephen Jay Gould has
pious tales to the effect that all that
happens is absolutely, and in an un-
qualified way, for the best. The real
world is more complicated, perplexing,
and interesting than any of these facile
accounts.
Dennett is far too clever to fall for
the grosser forms of reductionism. He
calls them 'greedy reductionism'' and
chides the likes of B. F. Skinner and
Edward O. Wilson for being too crude
in their attempts at explanation. His
own reductionism is much more so-
phisticated. One of Dennett's gifts is
the ability to invent lively and tenden-
tious terminology and stories in order
to back up his line of argument. He
characterizes the battle over reduction-
ism as being 'cranes'' versus 'sky-
hooks.'' The cranes are built from be-
low and they represent the complexity
and novelty that arise from the inter-
play of constituent bits and pieces, the
combined effects of many elementary
events. The skyhooks are to do duty as
representatives of organizing princi-
ples or acts of a holistic character,
whose nature and consequences will
not be discernible if we restrict our-
selves to a reductionist account. Of
course the name is chosen to suggest
that such top-down concepts are of an
implausible or frankly fabulous char-
acter. 'Skyhooks are miraculous lift-
ers, unsupported and insupportable.
Cranes are no less excellent as lifters,
and they have the decided advantage
of being real.'' This is clever debating
technique but it is not the way to settle
a serious issue. Skyhooks are not as
unanchored as Dennett would have us
think.
One of the serious questions that
many physical scientists wish to ask
about a purely Darwinian account of
the evolution of life is whether there
has been adequate time available to
accommodate the amazing variety and
complexity of change involved. Three
to four billion years may seem a long
period, but astonishing things have to
have happened, not least in the rapid
development of the hominid brain in
the space of only a few million years. Is
the patient accumulation and sifting of
small genetic differences sufficient to
accomplish this? Those who ask the
question are not querying the idea that
natural selection has a role to play, but
they simply ask whether it is by itself
totally adequate as an explanation.
The questioners are not looking for a
gap into which to insert the finger of
divine intervention, but they may just
be seeking a more comprehensive and
persuasive scientific account. People
like Paul Davies (The Cosmic Blue-
print) are very impressed with the re-
markable drive to complexity present
in cosmic history. Dennett occasionally
refers to this time-scale problem, but it
seems that neither he nor any other
evolutionary reductionist is able to of-
fer a convincing answer to it.
It seems entirely conceivable that
there are holistic laws of nature, cur-
rently unknown but in principle scien-
tifically discoverable, which drive the
'optimistic arrow'' of increasingly fruit-
ful development. Dennett's own mode
by Sir Walter Scott is good enough for
the movies; why so few of his fictions
have been filmed remains a mystery.
Nor is this movie based on his novel;
rather, on a scenario by Alan Sharp, a
much lesser Scot. I recall such annoy-
ing screenplays of his as those for The
Hired Hand and especially Night
Moves, not to mention his award-win-
ning novel, the dreary A Green Tree in
Gedde. He is, however, literate, and
not the typical Hollywood dunderhead;
for a historical adventure movie that
may be enough.
Rob Roy is basically a British film,
shot on location in Scotland; that is
what saves it. First, the British actors,
such as John Hurt as the nasty Mont-
rose, Brian Cox as the Machiavellian
Killearn, and Andrew Keir as the sat-
urnine Argyll. Next, the gorgeous loca-
tions (I was tempted to write ''loch-
ations''), compellingly shot by the
German cinematographer Karl Walter
Lindenlaub in Eastmancolor. Put Scot-
land and good color photography to-
gether and you have a marriage made
in Heaven. For it is not lush tropical
locales that come off best on color film;
they tend to look a bit gaudy, even
stagey. But take the chaste, strikingly
muted yet subtly varied colors of
Scotland, and film becomes seemingly
filmy, as if shot through a scrim, but
also with a certain patina, or perhaps a
sense of watercolors rather than oils,
insinuating rather than aggressive. It
is-I cannot avoid synaesthesia--in-
cantatory on the eye.
Then, too, the stars. As the rebel-
lious hero Robert Roy MacGregor,
there is the dashing Irishman Liam
Neeson, in kilts for the first time,
something to thrill all lassies-the
wee, the bonny, and even the Come
tious aural background; and the very
bit players and authentic extras con-
tribute handsomely to the epic sweep.
Under Michael Caton-Jones's pawky
direction, even Eric Stoltz manages to
come across as a proper clansman.
Only one thing jars. The villain, a Brit-
ish fop and swordsman played with
wonderful loathsomeness by Tim Roth,
is shown as a deadly fencer under his
foppish exterior. Nevertheless, in the
climactic duel, Roth is so puny com-
pared to Neeson, you think the latter
could have stretched out one bare,
swordless arm and kept him at bay.
Otherwise, though, the film fulfills
the modest expectations we have from
the genre; perhaps even a wee bit
more. I just wish it would not repre-
sent Scotland as a warm, sunny coun-
try; there is only so much disbelief a
body can suspend.
has given us a closer approximation of
what music sounded like from the six-
teenth century forward. (This has also
given us apergus on Haydn and
Mozart, and opened up through the
recordings of Paul Badura-Skoda many
of the once ''impossible'' pages of the
last Beethoven piano sonatas.) Yet
''Baroque'' is far from homogeneous.
Palestrina moves along more or less on
one level of meaning and involvement,
and Bach never attained the musical
depths and heights of Monteverdi, If
this is heresy, so be it.
But there is corroboration in a num-
ber of new recordings, which I believe
bear me out. Baroque: Palestrina, Mon-
teverdi, Choral Works (EMI Classics)
offers the Choir of King's College,
Cambridge, the Early Music Consort of
London, and resonant soloists, per-
forming both Palestrina's Missa Papae
Marcelli and extracts from Monte-
verdi's Vespro della Beata Vergine. The
truncated version of the Vespro hardly
compares with the full work, which
some time back was issued by the New
London Consort on 1Oiseau Lyre,
though it contains the magnificent
Magnificat. Yet it is sufficient to show
how far Monteverdi had advanced both
the ars musica, technically speaking,
and the content of music, as well as its

The publisher of a small newsletter is

something to offer small-business own-

logieally advanced.
Jo Roberts of Diamond Springs,
Calif., recently began her first foray
onto the Internet by advertising her Do
You Kxow Newsletter a collection of
practical ideas and information on mat-
ters pertaining to the home. Roberts,
who only recently traded her electrie

hoping to attract cyberspace audiences
to her fledgling publication without
spending much money. Her newsletter

British real-estate agents use the ratings
to promote properties that they are

Worldwatch suggests these strategies:
Exploit natural forces such as sun
and wind. Because half of the energy used
to make and run buildings goes to heat-
ing, ventilation, and lighting, designs that
draw the maximum benefit from natural
forces are the best way to save money and
reduce environmental impact. Planting
trees near buildings can cut cooling needs
up to 30 percent, according to the report.
Select efficient appliances and cli-
mate-control systems, which cost more
initially but save money in the long run. A
residential development in Texas cut
household utility bills by an estimated
$450 a year by using efficient appliances
and solar heating,which added about $156
a year to mortgage payments.

Creditors Gain Some Benefits
The bankruptey-reform law also
strengthens the ability of creditors to
recover goods they have sold to insolvent
businesses or individuals.
Previously, a seller could reclaim mer-
chandise from an insolvent debtor only by
making the request within 10 days after
the debtor received it.
The new law retains the 10-day dead-
line but gives the seller 10 more days to
request the goods if the original deadline
occurs after the bankruptey case starts.
Part from putting numerous bank-
i ruptey-eode changes in place, the

T reform measure proposes a nine-
member commission to study additional
problems with the code and recommend
more changes.
Gerdano says the commission itself
may be one of the mostimportant changes
in the new law, ''Additional recommenda-
tions are still needed to correct what
doesn't work anymore,'' he says,

a step in the right direction.
Which Chagterls Fer he?
Ifyour company is approaching insol-
vency, it may help to know more about the
various bankruptcy options that are avail-
able to you.
Here are brief descriptions of three key
forms of bankruptey:
Chapter 7
Individuals, sole proprietors, and corpo-
rations can use this provision to liquidate
assets and get out of debt. It requires the
sale of certain assets to satisfy the claims
of creditors.
''Chapter 7 may be right for you if you
have little property and are not concerned
with saving a large asset, such as a house,
from creditors,' says Alice Griffin, author
of Personal Bankruptcy What You
Should Know, a l41-page book from
Cakewalk Press, New York.
Chapter 11
Business people use this option to reor-
ganize a company and continue to operate
it. A major reason for reorganization via
Chapter 11 is that the value of the
business in operation is greater than the
value of its assets if they were to be sold.

This method may be right for you if you
have steady employment, including in-
come from an unincorporated business,
and you want to keep a valuable asset,
such as your home, says Griffin, Under
Chapter 18, debtors repay creditors in
installments over three to five years.
During that time, creditors may not start
or continue collection efforts.The new law

million from $450,000.
they will actually save on compliance
costs, And with the program in its infancy,
some are still struggling to adapt to a
whole new way of doing things.
For example, Cindy Deleo says manag-
ers at the tile company have had a tough
time fully understanding the new system of
regulation and have had to hire consultants
to help them sort out its ramifications.
Although some companies already have
entered the ''smog market'' to buy or sell
credits through brokers, overall demand for
credits is not high, and so prices are low.
The largest transaction to date occurred in
June, when a large glass company bought
credits to emit about 3 million pounds of
nitrogen oxides; it paid about 37 cents per
pound, Prices are expected to rise over the
next few years as the number of credits
allocated by regulators drops, says Anupom
Ganguli, planning and rules manager of the
air quality management district.
Last July, when business increased dra-
matically at Western Metal Decorating Co.,
the firm decided to buy nitrogen-oxides
emissions credits. The 90-employee com-
pany based in Cucamonga, ''bakes'' paint
onto metal cans for H.J. Heinz Co. and
other food processors.
The ceiling on Western Metals emissions
will drop in stages each year-from 9,60
pounds last year to 1,386 pounds by 2003.

ROM
WASHINGTON
Ruse you can use
When Rupert Murdoch decides to
finance a made-for-TV version of The
Newt Gingrich Story, you can bet that one
dramatic scene will be the House leader-
ship meeting at which Gingrich commits
the Republicans to balancing the budget
by 2002. As described breathlessly by
Paul Gigot of The Wall Street fournal, the
Republicans' commander was faced with
demoralization among his troops, John
Kasich, the chairman of the House Bud-
get Committee, wanted to back off the
balanced-budget promise:
When had this goal ever been 'written in
stone''? he wanted to know.
Whereupon Speaker Newt Gingrich imme-
diately piped up: 'I move that we write it in
stone. Do I hear a second?''
The second was heard, the mock motion
carried, and that's the last time [ohn Kasich
has mused about not balancing the budget.
More than the poll-driven Contract
with America, the Republicans' balanced-
budget promise has convinced many
otherwise levelheaded conservatives
that Gingrich is an American Thatcher
a revolutionary leader dedicated to dis-
solving the 'bureaucratic welfare state,''
The ''fact that Mr. Gingrich didn't know
how to make the numbers add up him-
self didn't seem to matter,'' David Rogers
and Gerald Seib of the fournal reported.
Great leaders take on great challenges,
after all. They don't necessarily bother
with annoying details: ''In one stroke, the
speaker had plunged himself-and his
party--into a commitment that has huge
ramifications..-.
Those of us who suspect that Gingrich
is something less than a world-historical
figure are understandably skeptical. To
meet their budget goal, we note, the
Republicans must cut the deficit by
sl.3 trillion over seven years, That's twice
as big as the cut in President Clinton's
1993 budget plan. And Clinton did more
than half of his deficitreducing with tax
increases, The Republicans say they will
do it with spending cuts alone-indeed,
while lowering taxes, and without touch-
ing Social Security. We skeptics have one
question: How are they going to weasel
out of this bindi
It's a good question to ask, even if you
sympathize with the GOP's zero-deficit
goal. Especially if you sympathize with it,
actually, since recogniing potential bud-
get scams is the first step to stopping
them. There are, it turns out, plenty of
ways to pretend to balance the budget
without really doing it. Here's a sampler:
Timeshifting: Want to show no deficit
in 2002? Push losses back to 2003. The
House Republicans' tax proposals, for
example, are heavily 'back-loaded,''
meaning their costs balloon over time.
True, it will be hard to put off the day of
reckoning for a full seven years-one
reason Kasich got cold feet. But some
GOP tax breaks actually generate
money for a few years before
2002 target? Better yet, have
the government sell a bunch of
assets-broadcast frequencies, loan port-
folios-just in time to eliminate the
deficit for a year.
Black boxes: ''We have decided that
we're taking Medicare into a separate
box,'' Gingrich announced recently. ''It
should not be entangled in the budget
debate,'' The speaker was clearly up to
some trickery, but nobody in Washing-
ton could figure out quite what. The
Medicare trust fund is scheduled to lose
sl61 billion between now and 2002. Was
Gingrich saying he was going to treat this
as ''off budget''-that he would only bal-
ance the budget before counting the
trust fund losses? That was too big a scam
even for Gingrich. Republicans could
hardly exclude Medicare, just because it
is generating losses, while counting Social
Security, which is currently generating
large surpluses. It's easy to balance a
budget if you simply don't count any pro-
gram that loses money.
But the ''separate box'' idea suggests a
less blatant, yet equally effective, ruse.
Republicans could note that the trust
fund is going broke, then call for a com-
mission to ''reinvent'' the program and
save, say, s250 billion over seven years,
(''Reinvention'' is to Gingrich what
''waste, fraud and abuse'' was to Reagan,
a way to pretend that huge budget cuts
can be achieved without actually hurting
anyone.)
Who could object if this Medicare
commission-which Senator Bob Dole
has already called for-takes a year or
two to come up with its recommenda-
tionsi In the meantime, the Republicans
can count the s250 billion in projected
savings as part of their bold budget plan.
Entitlement cats: How can Republicans
appear to control entitlement programs
other than Medicare-programs such as
Medicaid, farm subsidies, civil service
and military pensions? Simple. Cap
them. Write a law saying their cost shall
be held to-well, you can really fill in any
number you want. If costs exceed that
level, decree that the requisite amount
will automatically be ''sequestered.''
Sound familiar? This is the mechanism
that the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings bill
tried to use to control the budget. The
approach failed, of course, because when
the budget targets were breached and
the time came for a big sequester,

are antiMexican or related to ''hate,''The
article, instead, suggests hypocrisy in be-
ing pro-NAFTA and antibailout.
As I understand it, Phil Gramm and Al
D'Amato are making the case that a few
billion dollars will mainly help foreign
investors in Mexican debt instruments
and not Mexicans, I have read accounts
that report that what money has gone in
since the most recent peso drop has been
snatched out just as fast by investors in
order to close out their positions. The
dollar amount may be enough to help
investors, but the fundamentals of the
Mexican economy and currency man-
agement will overwhelm our cash ship-
ment and dictate Mexican well-being.
Gramm and D'Amato are also making
the point that bailing out what should be
high-risk investments reduces the associ-
ated risk, encourages further high-
default investment and therefore the
likelihood of more bailouts.
There may be intelligent counterpoint
to these arguments, Until then,I remain
unconvinced by Wright. Furthermore, it
their paternalistic pockets. Secondly, who else could
have bid for the loot? Foreigners would have been wary
of such massive investment in such an unstable country,
if indeed thev had been allowed to buy up so much of
Russia, And the average Ivan had neither the resources
nor the technical competence to take over large-scale
state property.
In other words, given the Soviet heritage, to create
a 'capitalism'' that would not be nomenklatura-
dominated was structurally unfeasible. Speed, moreover,
even at the cost of major compromises with the old
order, was vital if there was to be any transition at all.
Thhe evidence is now overwhelming that in a 'gradual''
transition from Communism the nomenklatura opts
economy is to revive, As a sign of this new restraint, after
the ruble's crash last October, the government finally
replaced the spendthrift Viktor Gerashchenko as direc-
tor of the Central Bank with the competent technician,
Tatiana Paramonova.
The prospect of an upturn is all the more plausible
since it is clear that a lot of people are getting rich in
Russia. Though we hear much of the new indigence of
the population, of retirement pensions destroyed and
of 30 percent of the nation living below the poverty
line, it is also true that New Russians are successful
entrepreneurs, Like erstwhile petro-Arabs, they have
become lavish spenders in the world's luxury spots from

wise meaningless things. Thus we have
language and money and weddings and
academic gowns and guest passes. The
world bifurcates into the created and
the uncreated, though there cannot be
the former without the latter.
But isn't all this obvious, even banal?
Not banal enough, in our postpost-
structuralist intellectual life. I wonder if
Searle would have written this book were
it not for the polemical purpose of refut-
ing certain fashionable doctrines to the
effect that reality itself is a construction
from human institutions; and yet, even if
Searle's book may be low on primary
philosophical thrills, it is bursting with
plain and necessary right-headedness,
He has performed a genuine service in
bringing his rigor to bear on the lazy

' t's not easy to pick up a book

i a practice once thought to be
& at the heart of the welllived
life,I mean the practice of reading, espe-
cially the kind of serious reading we were
taught was not only the means to an edu-
cation, but its selfdelighting end. And
though it may be comforting to hear
one's twilight fears echoed and elabo-
rated by someone so steadily persua-
sive as Sven Birkerts, it's hard to shake
the feeling that his book would more
profitably sit in the hands of those
who are least likely to turn to it: the grow-
ing number of ''wired'' citizens who con-
sider books, and book-reading, quaint
atavisms in the evolution of information
technology. This book's message is apt to
seem to them as distant as its medium.
The medium in this case is the old-
fashioned discursive essay-personal, re-
flective, edifying and (true to the title of
the collection) elegiac. Through the fif-
teen essays gathered here, two themes
march solemnly, purposefully and often
hand in hand. The first is that the read-
ing of good books is an essential, and
essentializing, activity: that it deepens
and individualizes us, cultivates our in-
wardness and even our souls, The second
is that the act of reading-specifically,
the serious and solitary engagementwith
works of great literature-is endangered
by the rise and expansion of the modern
technology of electronic ''interactivity.''
Few readers will have difficulty em-
bracing the first theme. Indeed, as read-
ers, they will have a harder time believ-
ing that anyone who doesn't engage
with great books can possess a soul
worth wondering about. This readerly
species of hubris in fact merits consid-
eration, not least because it persists
despite the efforts of some of the more
canny modernist writers to challenge its
blinkered arrogance. Joyce's Leopold
Bloom is a perfect case in point. This
supreme creature of the Dublin middle
class, this urban stroller and relisher of
the everyday, is not a reader in the sense
Birkerts would understand. That is,
Bloom would never sit down of an
evening with a novel by Flaubert; a line
from Yeats would probably baffle him.
Yet Joyce makes it abundantly clear-
it is practically the point of his novel-
that Bloom, in another sense, is a pro-
foundly discerning reader of the world's
manifold and seemingly random signs,
whether they be details from ephemeral
newspaper stories or advertising slogans,
the muttered words of his fellow citi-
zzens, or the shifting moods of his wife.
That a writer of such exquisitely man-
darin learning could have arrived at so
democratic an appreciation of the inte-
rior life of an extraordinary ordinary
man is one of the marvels of Ulsses.
The matter of Bloom is not tangential
to Birkerts's larger argument, as Birkerts
well knows. One of his essays explicitly
takes on the charge that literary sensi-
bility (or what Birkerts calls ''coherent
inwardness'') is no more than an elitist
affectation. To some extent, though, all
of the essays here force one to ask
whether ''people of the book'' are in-
deed guardians of the sacred and the
true, or just well-intentioned but ulti-
mately misguided idolaters who mistake
the vessel for the contents in their ef-
forts to perpetuate a cult of esotericism,
high learning, difficulty.
f1 irkerts makes a good case
f against the second con-
] clusion and in favor of the
A broadest, most democrat-
ic claims of a literary education. He
does so partly through a sympathetic
autobiografhia literaria that tells how he
came to books and how his life has
been shaped in service to them. Birk-
erts's literary education had a very
unstuffy, American quality-after col-
lege, he supported himself by working
in bookstores, fighting off depression
and self-doubt with voracious reading-
and the selfmocking candor with
which he describes himself is winning.
''I saw my role,'' he writes of his book-
store years, 'as quasipriestlv: I was
channeling the nourishing word to the
people who wanted it most. I had to
feel that because, otherwise, I was just
putting in time at a low-paying retail
job, not at all ministering to the life of
the culture or moving along a worthy
career path.''
But even while the priestly metaphor
is ironic here, it hints at a somewhat less
democratic notion of the literary life.
Simply put, Birkerts believes that litera-
ture has a salvific purpose, though salva-
tion, to him, is very much a worldly mat-
ter: its other name is individuality. We
go to serious reading, Birkerts suggests,
out of a sense of self-insufficiency (a sec-
ular variant, one might say, of Original
Sin): ''To open a book voluntarily is at
some level to remark the insufficiency
either of one's life or of one's orienta-
tion toward it.'' And what do readers
accomplish in reading? Typically, Birk-
erts explains, they establish their ''in-
wardness, the more reflective compo-
nent of their self, in the space that read-
ing opened up.''That space is more tem-
poral than physical-not the time of
sequential, measurable units but time
beyond time, in which the reader can
see that, ''God or no God, life has a uni-
tary pattern inscribed within it, a pat-
tern that we could discern for ourselves
if we could somehow lay the whole of
our experience out like a map.''
If such arguments have a familiar ring,
it is because Birkerts embraces the
Arnoldian ideal of art as the last stay
against anarchy, the noble stand-in for
Leven---himself a former shrink-has taken
a heavy conceit and lightened it into com-
edy, which is what it deserves, Brando en-
joys himself hugely, especially in his scenes

a romantic icon with ''Four Weddings and a

smile and cloaks himself in an aura of
modest, befuddled sncerity. But the
illusion of ease has vanished, and
his charm has gone with it. Christo-
pher Monger, the writer and direc-
tor, works just as strenuously to en-
chant us, and, like the star, he
overtaxes his lightweight virtues. For
a while, this slight anecdote about a
Welsh village during the First World
War seems an amiable anachro-
nism-a throwback to the eccentric-
community formula of Ealing com-
edy. But Monger tries to pile more
meaning onto his story than its frag-

buries the small good thing he started

sFFesoN m Ps-The subject of Thomas Jef-
ferson's five years as ambassador to France
is so rich and engaging that 1t should be
impossible to make a dull film about 1t;
nevertheless, the producing and directimg
team of Ismail Merchant and James Ivory
have pulled it off. The period detail is numb-
ing, and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala's script sounds
like a stash of letters being read aloud.
Nothing sparks between Nick Nolte, as Jef-
ferson, and Greta Scacchi, as the married
woman with whom he is in love, and the
high point of his ardor for the hlack maid
with whom he is alleged to have had an
affair (Thandie Newton) is the furtive un-
buckling of a shoe. When Gwyneth Paltrow,
who plays Jefferson's impatient daughter, tears
off her fancy wig and stuffs it into a vase,
we know just how she feels,-A.L. (Paris.)

wonderful cast-which includes David Ca-

Samuel L. Jackson, and Stanley Tucci--and
a crafty, low-key screenplay by Richard

Only Nicolas Cage, who plays the chief vil-

v FsiLY-Like Gregory Nava's first feature,
''E1 Norte,'' this portrait ot three generations
of a Mexican-American clan in East Los
Angeles occasionally goes haywire on senti-
ment. The big-canvas approach works best
at capturing the way large immigrant fami-
lies produce utterly disparate people who are
nevertheless helplessly connected, Though
the supporting cast is spotty, Eduardo Lopez
Rojas is exceptionally fine as the patriarch,
a befuddled and repressed optimist; Esai
Morales smolders charismatically as his luck-
less son; and Jimmy Smits, playing an ex-
con, overcomes some implausible dialogue
to get at the sweetness and hurt underneath
his macho shell, With Edward James Olmos.

Van Peebles throws in everything plus
ten kitchen sinks: real and simulated
documentary footage, gratuitous punches
and gunshots in glorious surround-
sound, buddy-movie elements in the
interaction of Bobby and Huey, By the

pigs and revolutionary hotheads-as well
as the mob, the F.B.I., and a drug-
dealing black Judas, who have con-
spired to annihilate the Panthers by
flooding the ghetto with heroin. With

Pcruae Bine-A nice-looking, earnest fem-

woman (Y ouk Kudoh) who enters into
an arranged marriage with a sugarcane
cutter (Akira Takayama) in Hawaii in 1918.
The picture eamines the role of the Japa-
nese contract laborers in the early part of
this century and the limited choices ava1l-
able to the women who joined them. Al-
though the director, Kayo Hatta, and her
co-writer (and sister), Mari Hatta, have
added some Hawaiian folklore and a little
Magic Realism, the characters are stereo-
typed composites of sociohistorical forces.
Even as history, though, this film fails to

artiul English fops (Tim Roth and John Hurt).
This should make for rousing spectacle, but
somehow it doesn't. With Jessica Lange as

as a ripping yarn,--T.R. (4/17/95) (Mov-
and C.E.O. of Archer-Daniels-MGdland;
Robert Strauss, the former Democrat-
ic National Committee chairman; and
Dan Lufkin, a founder of the Wall
Street firm of Donaldson, Lufkin &
Jenrette. To run Columbia over all, he
recruited a fiend, Alan Hirschfield. To
run the studio, he hired David Begel-
man, Barbra Streisand's agent, whom
Ray Stark had recommended. The stu-
dio made a comeback, and Stark and
Allen became close. Stark introduced
Allen to the powers of Hollywood, and
he introduced him to the pleasures of
Sun Valley. Allen and Stark were in-
congruous friends: one brassy, the other
private; one a shameless self-promoter,
whose official six-page biography boasts
of his ''unique personality,' the other so
modest that in 1979, when he was dat-
ing the actress Ann Reinking, he did
not tell her that he had tackled a rob-
ber on Nadison Avenue, wrestled the
gun away, and held the man down un-
til the police arrived. Reinking, who
later became Allen's second wife, read
about it in the New York Poa. 'I[
Herbert were a girl, ITd marry him,'
Stark says, ''He's the perfect kind of
companion.''
Life at Columbia was not all glam-
our. In September of 1977, Allen
learned that David Begelman had
forged signatures on three studio checks
worth a total of forty thousand dollars.
Hirschfield wanted to fire Begelman
immediately. Stark wanted to give
Begelman, a friend, a chance to explain.
Allen sided with Stark.
At first, Columbia executives quietly
turned the matter over to the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the Los
Angeles District Attorney's Office,
but when the publicity continued the
board stripped Begelman of his titles
and his options and removed him from
the board. Allen and Stark were an-
noyed; they continued to consult Begel-
man, and in December Hirschfield tried
to placate them by reinstating him as
the head of the studio, only to ease
him out again in February of 1978. In
David McClintick's best-selling book
''Indecent Exposure'' Allen was por-
trayed as a cynic. Friends felt that he
was just being loyal. To this day, Allen
expresses no regret, He refuses to think
of Begelman's act as thievery, saying
that he had had a mental breakdown.
He attributes the furor to a ''post-
Watergate morality,' and says of the
matter, 'Given the morality of the day,
and the uproar in the press, it was un-
realistic to think he could be reinstated.''
There was one other casualty of this
sorry affair: Alan Hirschfield. Before
1978 ended, Allen had replaced him
with Fay Vincent, who was then a law-
yer with the S.E.C.
In 1981, Donald Keough, the presi-
dent of Coca-Cola and its No. 2, vis-
ited Allen. Domestic sales of Coke had
reached a plateau, Keough told him; the
company was looking for ways to shore
up domestic earnings and would be in-
terested in acquiring Columbia if it was
available. Keough recalls being stunned
when Allen, instead of trying to sell him
on the value of Columbia, warned him
that the entertainment business con-
tained unwelcome surprises, insufferable
egos, and uninvited publicity, and that
entering the field might mean Coca-
Cola's wholesome name would be tar-
nished. 'He raised a lot of objections
that he thought we might like to con-
sider,' says Keough, who soon became
a close fiend of Allen's. 'He was like
Aquinas, It was sort of symbolic of
Herbert.' Despite Allen's warnings,
Coca-Cola wanted to buy, and in
March of 1982 Allen sold Columbia for
seventy-two dollars a share, or nearly
thirty dollars a share more than its stock
price. Since Allen had paid roughly
three dollars a share for the stock a de-
cade before, the deal was a dream for
ing a cut-rate franchise to Washington,
where large sectors of the Orioles' fn
base make their home.) The O's, whose
assets include the delectable downtown
Camden Yards-the very model of a
modern major stadium---and the game's
prime active hero, Cal Ripken, [r., drew
ninety-seven per cent of capacity for
their home opener and have already sold
eighty-five per cent of the available tick-
ets for the remainder of their season.
The best P.R., one might almost say,
comes naturally.
If my own state of mind about the
immediate condition of the pastime is
any indicator, bad feelings about base-
ball now center on the apparent inde-
structibility of the long feud between the
two embittered parties, and the fact that
the strike seems to have settled nothing.
Iegotiations between the owners and
the Players Association, which had
seemed to be edging closer to a compro-
mise settlement just before fudge Soto-
mayor's intervention, have screeched to
a stop, and there is persistent talk that
both sides are now girding for another
showdown at World Series time next
year. For the present, both sides are left
with a shattered economy that will con-
tinue to offer very high salaries to a rela-
tively small number of star players---
about fifteen per cent of the total, that
is--and much less to the remainder.
Major-market clubs like the Yankees
and Braves and Colorado Rockies will
continue to snatch up the available top
pitchers and fielders and sluggers, as
they have lately done with the likes of
Jack McDowell and Marquis Grissom
and Larry Walker, and have-not teams,
such as the Expos and Mariners and Pi-
rates---the small-market franchises
DANCING
TTiwYLA THARFs imaginnaion s
purely kinetic. It is notably not
. literary (the more she toys with
story lines and notional inspirations, the
more she proves herself unsuited to them),
but neither is it visual. Tm not questioning
the visual attractiveness of her work. She
was an art-history major and at one time
the wife of a painter; and she has visual
taste. But not visual imagination. The ab-
sence of a visualizing capacity creates the
odd rift between feeling and form that
makes some of her work, despite the
devouringly kinetic energy, enigmatic in
the wrong way. One simply does not see
what she sees. A choreographer's visual
imagination is more like a sculptor's than
like a painter's. Even Tharp's best work
denies or is sublimely innocent of the Re-
naissance perspective that informs the
proscenium stage. Tharp moves across,
around, and in between stage areas, set-
ting up clouds of bee-like activity in the
interstices of the Renaissance grid or
channelling her dancers through it like
a traffic cop. She comes straight at you
and flies off--not on a tangent but on a
tangents tangent. It can be breathtaking.
The great fault line in Tharp can promote
ingenious effects on its own, and the
bursting kineticism has often concealed it
completely. But the center cannot always
hold. Sometimes it's only velocity that
stands between Tharp and disaster.
Tharp has just made three ballets for
American Ballet Theatre. The best is a
jazz panorama, a collaboration with
Wynton Marsalis called 'Jump Start.'
''Americans We'' is about the nineteenth
century in scenes and anecdotes---the
things Tharp is least good at--alternat-
ing with the fully revved-up bravura
dances she does well but overdoes here.
''How Near Heaven,' the only one of the
three pieces that enters the repertory this
season, is almost totally opaque. Ive seen
it three times, twice at the Kennedy Cen-
ter, where it had its world premiere, and
again at the Met, where the new works
were presented together on an all-Tharp
evening, and I am no nearer Heaven than
Iwas the first time.''How Near Heaven''--
the title comes from Emily Dickinson---
has two women dancing nearly identical
roles in what appears to be a metaphysi-
cal drama. The forces in play are repre-
sented by male partners, male groups, fe-
male groups, and mixed couples, all of
whom come and go in different combi-
nations, wearing flowing silk costumes by
Gianni Versace. As you sit through the
piece trying to decipher its meaning, your
attention fastens on little incidents em-
bedded in the flow--a pot-smoking
party, a funeral. But they don't add up.
What adds up is the lingerie--the silk
costumes changing from white to black
and back again, the men appearing with-
out their tops, and the one couple in sky-
blue silk who keep coming and going
without changing. When the Eternal
Ones make an exit in silence as the lights
fade, you think the piece must be over,
but the lights fade to dark, stars come out
on the backcloth, and it starts all over
again. 'How Near Heaven'' is Tharp at
her mushiest-it even has a mushy con-
sistency, The music is Benjamin Britten's
''Variations on aTheme of Frank Bridge.'
Britten has his own scaffolding, and his
surface is tense and glossy. Tharp trans-
lates none of this to the stage. His taffeta
strings and her macrame are from sepa-
rate worlds; never for one moment do
music and choreography get together in
this ballet.
For choreographers who were brought
up in ballet, as Tharp was not, a formal
capacity for visualization is not really a
gift; it is an asset built into their training.
When literariness or picturesqueness is
getting Tharp into trouble, when she's
aiming at major effects and misfiring,
there's no big picture clearly in motion
and Asian nation, the war was a disaster
without parallel in history. What the butch-
er's bill shows-and what the end of the
cold war makes it easier to acknowledge-
is that the war against Nazi Germany was
overwhelmingly fought and won by the So-
viet Union.'The British and American cam-
paigns in Western Europe and North Africa
were almost sideshows.
Body count: Take the most basic index,
the body count. Most of the casualties of
World War II came on the German-Soviet
front. The Soviets lost 10 million soldiers
and at least that many civilians; by some
estimates 15 million civilians died, mostly
from starvation, forced labor and German
reprisals. Only the European Jews and
Gypsies lost a larger percentage of their
population. Germany lost 4 million sol-
diers, most of them on the eastern front;
another 3 million German civilians died,
perhaps two thirds of them in forced expul-
sions from Eastern Europe. By contrast, the
United States lost 408,000 troops in both
Europe and the Pacific, while Britain lost
244,000 men, plus 60,000 civilians. There's
another reason why the American perspec-
tive on the war is unique. The economy of
every other combatant was devastated, but
America's grew by an average of 10 per-
cent a year. By 1945 the United States had
achieved a global economic supremacy un-
matched in history (and now fading).
What's amazing about World War II is
how little it settled. Yes, Hitler was defeat-
ed, and on VJ Day the following August.
the Japanese empire collapsed. But in the
bloody dawning ofthe post-cold-war world,
we see that the issues that underlay World
War II confront us still, no easier to answer
now, it turns out, than in what the poet
Auden fashionably reviled as the ''low dis-
honest decade'' of the 1930s. Roosevelt and
Churchill dreamed of a new world order
mediated by the United Nations (benefi-
cently controlled by the great powers sit-
ting on the Security Council). The cold war
sidetracked that dream. For a brief period
in the early 1990s, during the Bush adminis-
tration, it looked as if the dream would be
revived. But now ''new world order'' has
become a term of opprobrium for many; the
American mood has swung sourly against
the United Nations--indeed, against all no-
tions of multilateralism.
The future and security of Central Europe
are amajor piece of unfinished business. The
way World War II ended resolved for nearly
50 years the problems of Central Europe: the
Soviet Union simply absorbed the region.
Now that the states of Central Europe are
free once more, the problems of their securi-
ty are with us again. It is not at all clear that
current U.S. policy-the so-called ''Partner-
ship for Peace''-is in reality very different
from the deeply ambiguous security guaran-
tees that Britain and France offered those
same states in the 1930s.
In retrospect, the two world wars and the
cold war are in some fashion a definable
Epic victories: Battle flags in Red Square
gILL CLINTON LOOKED MORE THAN A
ille dspleased when he emes4
Eom his three-hour summit with Bo-
ris Yeltsin to answer questions last week.
He was going to have to wing it; overzeal-
ous Kremlin security had bottled up the
senior staff who were carrying his opening
statement. Not that there was much to say.
On substance and even symbolism, Clinton
had been outmuscled. Yeltsin stuck to plans
for selling nuclear reactors to Iran, re-
mained hostile toward NATO's expected
eastward expansion and ignored Clinton's
pleas for a permanent ceasefire in Chech-
nya. As if to underscore the intransigence,
Russian helicopters that day fired rockets
into farmhouses in a Chechen village.
For all the White House's talk about
a tougher, less Yeltsin-centric approach
to Russia's rogue behavior, Clinton still
seemed oddly protective of his counterpart.
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole branded
the gathering ''a failure'' and called for a
reassessment of U.S. aid. Even nonparti-
san observers were nonplused. ''This rein-
forces the impression that this administra-
tion has a pro-Yeltsin policy, not a pro-
democracy policy,'' says Michael McFaul of
the Carnegie Endowment in Moscow.
Knowing what was coming, the White
House had labored for weeks to lower ex-
pectations. The U.S.-Russian relationship,
it argued, was too important to be ''held
hostage'' to a few thorny issues. As he flew
home, a weary Clinton appealed for a new
view of summitry in the post-cold-war era,
in which the stakes-and the prospects for
breakthroughs-are diminished.''Once in a
while something spectacular will happen.
Once in a while a wheel will run off and
something bad will happen,'' he said. ''But
we need to view this in the context of a
steady effort.'' No wheels fell off in Mos-
cow, but a couple continued to wobble.
Ghechnya: Yeltsin was unyielding about
his brutal suppression of the Chechen re-
bellion, ignoring Clinton's entreaties for a
political solution. He likened the uprising
to Oklahoma City-style terrorism and char-
acterized Russian activity in the region as
mostly ''creative work,'' such as rehabilitat-
ing buildings. Clinton's attitude to such
oughly analyze the contract details and not
find a single rotten thing in it.''
MAI0: On the delicate question of Eu-
ropean security, Clinton did manage to
wrest a concession. Yeltsin agreed to move
Russia into the Partnership for Peace-a
U.S.- and NATO-inspired organization de-
signed to foster cooperation with countries
oftheold Soviet bloc.Yeltsin'swillingnessto
sign membership documents eases tensions
triggered last December when he predicted
that NATO plans would bring about a ''eold
peace.'' But deep differences over NATO's
expansion to the east remain unresolved.
The two men agreed to discuss the matter
again at the G-7 meeting in Halifax next
month, but they are unlikely to come to
terms, And despite U.S. insistence that Rus-
sian opposition won't slow expansion, some
Eastern European countries are dubious.
Clinton did his best work last week out-
side the Kremlin, face to face with the Rus-
sian people. In a thoughtful speech at Mos-
cow State University, he urged students to
stay the course with democracy. He ate
breakfast with opposition leaders, who told

rest of America gets on with its affairs, the
hard part has only just begun for the fam-
ilies ofvictims.''Let the healing begin,'' said
evangelist Billy Graham four weeks ago at
the memorial service televised throughout
the nation. His call was wildly premature.
Throughout the city, the aftershocks of the
homemade bomb that took 168 lives and
wounded more than 400 others are still
being felt. One family that lost a child con-
tinues to set an extra place at the dinner
table. A rescue worker keeps splashing his
face with cologne yet still can't rid himself
of the stench of rotting bodies. A woman
who lost all her children in the blast asks,
numbly: 'Am I still a mother?''
Grief is a complex process. Unlike be-
in theological perspective. ''God did not do
this,'' he reminded a congregation of 250
friends and family members, lest any of
them were tempted to blame the Creator.
''Evil people did.'' Others, though, suggest-
ed that the tragedy was somehow God's
will, or sought to comfort families by telling
them that their children were now little
angels in a place beyond all pain.
But Grollman believes the need to blame
is a normal part of the grieving process,
especially when death comes unexpectedly
and without reason. ''No one likes to lose
someone in this life, even those who believe
in an afterlife,'' he says. From his own study
of clerical reactions to death, Grollman
finds that ''many clergy do not believe the
bromides they tell others at funerals. I told
a meeting of clergy in Oklahoma City that
it's OK to be angry at God. He's big enough
to take it,''
Galm Waters: A mass tragedy can reopen
barely buried hurts. People are ''regrieving
from previous losses,'' says John Dudley, a
school counselor from Lincoln, Neb., who,
like hundreds of others, went to Oklahoma
City to help out. One therapist came
to the aid of an elderly woman in Okla-
homa City, at a meeting of Calm Waters,
one of several support groups aiding the
survivors throughout the area. She com-
plained of feeling sick--something that
hadn't happened when her husband died
last February.
Grief takes many forms. When a parent
dies, the past dies too. When a spouse dies,
the present disappears. And a child who
dies takes a parent's future with him. Al-
though grief is a universal emotion, coping
with it is a skill that must be acquired. But ]
studies show that most Americans are well ]
into their 40s or 50s before they experience ]
the death of someone close. Moreover, ]
''grieving has been greatly affected by ]
changes in the family like the increase in ]
divorce, remarriages and the movement of ]
grown children far from home,'' says John ]
Carmon, a funeral director in Windsor, ]
Conn, Carmon is one of a growing number ]
offuneral directors who employ griefthera- ]
pists to help survivors cope months after ]
the funeral. ''Many people today have no ]
faith or family,'' Carmon fnds. ''Even ]
strongly religious people don't necessarily ]
have the coping skills that the intact family ]
used to bring to death 30 years ago.''
The worst depression that survivors ex- ]
perience usually comes six months after the ]
death of a loved one. But grieving is a life- ]
long process, experts say, a pain that never ]
goes away and only gets less bad. A single [

Robinson concedes that it is ''disquiet-

ment'' for blacks to denounce black lead-

hyphenated American minority group
faces: how much dirty laundry to expose
to outsiders who are not always sympa-
thetic. Gwen McKinney, president of a
black public-relations firm in Washington,
says that ostracizing Nigeria is a ''double-
edged sword.'' While protesters march,
Congress is putting foreign aid to Africa
on the chopping block. Will the protests
encourage the aid cutters? Will the cam-

stereotypes of the ''Dark Continent''? Ste-

''what it really is as opposed to the myths
and the dreams.'' That's hard to do, while

So it's not just a matter
of our scoping-out digital cameras; it's also a matter of the
systems makers scoping-out us. Because the best we can
say about standards of judgment in multimedia and video
is: it depends,
The Sony Jumbotron that makes you blind at five feet
looks as crisp as an RGB Laserdisc across the stadium. Our
assessments must be case-specific again, just like the other
fields where digital cameras are considered. How much of
a luster you need, and how much you'll get, are the issues
in balance for every production. You'll never go larger than
a monitor screen? Buy a digital camera, and enjoy! As long
as you're sure you'll never have to crop too much into any
image. And yes, cropability is one major difference be-
tween 640 x 480 resolution, and something higher.
The 640 s 480 specification fills a 14-inch computer
nonitor, but ''floats'' in the middle of a 20-inch screen.
Dub the digital image to NTSC videotape and run it on
TV monitors, however, and you can fill almost any size
4creen, Do you know the conditions under which your
according to Bob Seitz, president of Visual In-Seitz, an
AV production company in Rochester, New York, 'When
one of my staff asked what the real benefits are of a digital
camera,'' he said, 'I made a flow-chart outlining the steps
and their typical costs for images that start on film, and in
digital formats, The figures for digital were about half.''
The figures are generalizations, and make certain as-
sumptions, such as the perfection of the digital image on
the first take without the need for reshooting. Still, as a
rule-of-thumb for tabletop photography destined for the
presentation screen, Seitz' figures are about as close to a
rule-of-thumb as any estimate can come.
VIDEO FUTURES
One of the golden promises of digital cameras has been
the prospect of an electronic presentation system-the
systems as such, than because of the limits inherent in cur-
rent display apparatus.
Most video projectors, after all, are geared for NTSC
resolution. And although there are so-called data-grade
and graphics-grade electronic projectors, they're extremely
expensive and therefore not widely installed at this point.
High-definition TV projectors, such as those conforming
to the old 1125/60 analog standard, could make the most
of a high-resolution digital image. But unfortunately, hi-
def means more than just simple pixel resolution. Most
such standards propose a panoramic screen, with an aspect
ratio in the vicinity of 16:9. The CCDs commonly used
in digital cameras are more like 3:2 (film ratio) or 4:3
(NTSC ratio). Going to the wider screen could require
cropping, again.
Still, the digital camera finds many surprising uses in
multimedia presentations suggesting, once more, that pre-
sentations may prove to be among its most natural mar-
kets, 'We make a lot of composites,'' said Seitz, 'in which
adapter. VCRs accessed information
too slowly and the cost of videodisc
players and mastering videodiscs lim-
ited their use to high-end or high-

on which of the two standards to adopt.
Mosaic, developed by the National Center
for Supercomputing Applications at the
University of Illinois, comes with an unusual
licensing agreement. A master licensing
agreement between NCSA and Spyglass
means NCSA doesn't handle requests for
licenses. In 1994, Spyglass developed En-
hanced NCSA Mosaic (a modified version of
the Mosaic found free on the Net) and now
licenses it to software publishers, hardware
manufacturers, and book publishers.
You can find Enhanced Mosaic technol-
ogy in such products as Spry's Air Mosaic
(Spry has recently been acquired by
CompuServe). Luckman Interactive's Super
Mosaic, and Ouarterdeck's Omosaic, as well
as in hardware from Digital Equipment
Corp. and in books from publishers such as
O'Reilly & Associates and Ventana Press.
A recentmajor addition to Spyglass's sta-
ble is Microsoft, which has licensed
Enhanced Mosaic for Windows 95. But
Microsoft hasn't yet made clear whether or in
what form Enhanced Mosaic might appear.
Unlike NCSA, Netscape Communica-
tions Corp. freely licenses the Web browser
it developed. Netscape Navigator has over-
taken the FTP version of NCSA Mosaic as
the most frequently used ''free'' browser on
the Web, but-strictly speaking-it's not a

from scripts written in a simple scripting
language. You can use drawing tools and
add bitmaps to adjust and add to a dia-
gram, but the diagram's structure is con-
trolled by its script.
Does this approach makes sense'? It
does if you'd rather put your energy into
defining structure than into depicting it.
Moreover, the program assists so well
with script generation and offers so many
well-designed alternatives regarding the
final appearance of its diagrams, that
many users will be relieved not to have to
rely on drawing tools.
You enter scripts in a supplied editor:
you can also import them from your own
editor. You can split the screen to show
both diagram and script, or toggle be-
tween screens. A click in the diagram
window updates the diagram to the cur-
rent state of the script. In the script, you
type the text that will appear in each dia-
gram shape and use punctuation to indi-
cate connections between shapes. A peri-
od denotes a sequential step, for
example, while a question mark intro-
duces a yeslno branch. Acquiring a work-
ing knowledge of the language will take
only about an hour.
You can diagram first and study later,
thanks to 108 sample scripts for numerous
common diagram archetypes. The ability
to diagram first is new to this version and
makes the package more accessible than
previous versions, Templates (there are
32) include fill-in-the-blank placeholders
containing instructions such as ''cState-
ment on Yes Branch>''. When you put
Style choices are recorded in a separate
file that can be merged with any script file
to achieve consistency across diagrams.
To facilitate global changes, the program
offers a button that you click to cycle
through canned formatting combinations
appropriate for the current diagram.
Other packages achieve the same effect
by saving customized templates or offer-
ing similar features. To help you make
local changes, a right mouse-click brings
up a one-stop property dialog. You can
also drag handles to change a symbol's
size or shape (but not its position), or click
on a draw palette to add boxes, straight
lines, or text. For further adornment, all-
Clear supplies 50 clip-art images.
allClear lets you link diagrams and at-
tach a node to any file. You can store the
linked diagrams in one file, rather than go
through the arduous process of linking files
on your disk. The package also lets you dis-
tribute a runtime version of flowcharts.
Printing features include scaling to a
single page, intelligent page breaks, the
option to omit blank pages, and page
mapping. If you map, a footer indicates
the numbers of continuing pages on the
top, bottom, left, and right.
The program has OLE 1.0 server and 5
Lotus Notes/FX support, exports ,WMF
files, and can generate diagrams from data
stored in WK1 and .DBF files. With justa
bit of preprocessing, you can make your
,DBF file a data source for an organization

ly pick up personnel data in .DBF fields.

Windows 3.0 to Windows 3.1. The Win-
dows 3.0 documentation reverses the
meanings of the two parameters, labeling
the first double-word parameter as re-
served and the second word parameter as
wReturnCode. Also in the 3.0 documen-
tation, the wReturnCode value is de-
scribed as the value Windows returns to
DOS as its return code. While this value
has no meaning if Windows is restarted or
the system is rebooted, it can be valuable
for those times where the Windows ses-
sion is simply terminated.
The ExitWindowsExec function pro-
vides a convenient way for an application
to end a Windows session, run a DOS ap-
plication, and return to Windows after the
1DOS application has closed. This function
takes two parameters: a pointer to a string
containing the DOS application to run
and a pointer to the parameters to pass to
the DOS application.
Both ExitWindows and ExitWindows-
Exec return a Boolean value indicating
the success or failure of the functions.
While it might seem strange that a func-
tion shutting down Windows could fail, it
is a common occurrence. The reason is
that all Windows applications are notified
that Windows is shutting down and must
agree to the shutdown. Most users know
that shutdown will fail if a DOS session is
running and the PIF says not to ''Allow
Windows is loading. Though less conve-
nient, the LOAD= and RUN= lines do
have one important advantage in that they
are processed before the Startup group.
With the LOAD and RUN keys, you can
ensure that a given program is loaded first.
Now that we have reviewed how Win-
dows starts and ends, it is time to look
again at SaveIt. SaveIt's functions can be
divided into four parts: knowing when
Windows is shutting down, determining
the programs running when the shutdown
occurs, knowing what programs the Pro-
gram Manager will start when Windows
restarts, and launching the appropriate
programs when Windows restarts.
Detecting that Windows is shutting
down is simply a matter of checking for
the WM OUERYENDSESSION and
WM ENDSESSION messages. When
SaveIt receives a WM OUERYEND-
SESSION, it performs the work to deter-
mine what programs need to be started
next time. The list of these programs is
then saved in SaveIt's .INI file. SaveIt re-
turns TRUE when it processes the
WM OUERYENDSESSION message
to indicate it is okay for Windows to shut
down. When the WM ENDSESSION
message is received, a check of the
wParam parameter is made to be sure that
Windows is indeed shutting down, If so,
SaveIt adds its program name to the
LOAD= line so that it will be started

KEY VICTORY Computer manufacturers
do not have a legal obligation to warn PC users
about the potential danger of overusing comput-
er keyboards, ruled a jury in Hastings, Minn.
The jury'sverdict absolved IBM of liability in
a suit brought by former high school secretary
Nancy Urbanski, Urbanski claimed that faulty
design of the keyboard was to blame for repeti-
tive stress injuries that forced her to quit her job.
After nine weeks of trial, though. the jury
took only a few hours to return its verdict. The
jury found that IBM's keyboards were not
faulty and that the company had no obligation
to warn users about the dangers of overuse.
Ironically, the jury also absolved co-
defendant Apple Computer Corp. of liability a
week after Apple reached an undisclosed
out-of-court settlement. Apple's settlement
followed on the heels of a revelation that its
attorneys had withheld documents from the
plaintiffs law team during pretrial discovery.
The trial could have far-reaching ramifica-
tions. Steve Phillips, one of the attorneys repre-
senting Urbanski, represents more than 1,000
other plaintiffs filing suit against computer
manufacturers. Like Urbanski, fhey claim they
suffered injuries as a result of faulty keyboard
design or because manufacturers failed to
warn them of the dangers of overuse. An IBM
representative said the Urbanski verdict shows
that both research and the law were on its side.

nancing or locate new in-
vestors. While a well-written and
professionally prepared financial plan is essen-
tial in obtaining needed capital for growth,
these planning documents represent a snap-
shot in time and generally are filed away never
to see the light of day again.
Real strategic planning, however, is one of
the most valuable tools a business can use in
charting its course. Used as an ongoing tool. a
marketing and business plan can help man-
agers focus their energy and resources in areas
that will improve profitability. Planning can
provide a clearer understanding of the market-
place and the strengths and weaknesses of the
competition, as well as help businesses formu-
late clearer strategies and allocate funds to
areas that will maximize returns.
Why is this invaluable tool so seldom used?
The reasons are simple. First, it requires the ac-
tive participation and input of top manage-
ment; it is not something that can be handed to
a consultant or a planning department to put
together. Second, it requires constant moni-
toring and refinement. Third, it requires busi-
ness owners and managers at all levels to
change the way they do business. Planning re-
quires thought before action, proactive (not re-
active) management, and allocation of funds
based on return on investment.
Whether you are looking for that snapshot
in time or you are willing to change the way
you run your business, there are several soft-
ware options that can help you get the job ]
done. Here's a look at some software pro-
grams, tanging from the bestselling planning l
tools to put together a professional sales docu-
ment to serious software for improving your
business and bottom line.
B2ZPLANBUILDER BlEPlanB.ild:r is he
No. 1seller largely due to its simplicity. The pro-
gram uses templates to prepare the plan, which
differ based on the type of computer (Macintosh
or DOS) and software used. The overall layout
of the plan is fairly comprehensive and, with the
template approach, easy to modify.
The integrated financial template is well or-
ganized, easy to use, and provides for suffi-
cient detail to handle most businesses. The
financials are generated by entering assump-
tions, basic history information, and pricing
and cost data. In addition to basic statements,
the financials include break-even analysis,
ratio analysis, gross profit analysis, and a per-
sonal financial statement.
Since it's an integrated template, however,
the file cannot be modified (lines or columns
added or deleted)without undermining the in-
tegrity of the financials.
BizPlanBuilder is suited for the first-time
planner. While it uses templates, is composed
of separate narrative and financial sections,
and presents a predefined format that's not
suited for all businesses, the financials are basi-
cally sound and easy to use. The manual and
sample plans offer good insight as to what is
needed for a professional plan. It's most suit-
able for developing plans to present to banks

ibility to justify throwing
existing calculators or create custom calcula-
tors to fit your specific needs. You are pro-
vided with various display options, entry
notations, and unit conversions. FentaCalc Pro
also can graph any one-variable function.
The two components of PentaCalc Pro are
the display interface, similar to the display
on a handheld calculator, and calculator
interface, which looks like a calculator
keyboard. The display interface consists of a
title bar, menu bar, tape display, and entry
display. Interfaces can be attached to one
another, resized, and scaled.
The tape display not only shows a record of
your calculations, but can include memo nota-
tions next to any entry so you can remember
what a calculation was for. The tape is 'live,''
which allows you to make recalculations from
any point in the tape by editing both numbers
and operators using standard Windows
methods of inserting, deleting, etc. Tapes can
be printed and saved as files. You can quickly
transfer the results of your calculations be-
tween PentaCalc Pro and other Windows ap-
plications by using the clipboard.
FINANCIAL CALCULATIONS
PentaCalc Pro includes several tools for
financial calculations such as amortization
tables, compound interest, cash flow,
bond yields, depreciation, percentages, and
interest rate conversions.
For instance, assume your business has a
large amount of money to invest and you
must weigh the investment options. You are
faced not only with varying interest rates, but
with different compounding periods. Bank ac-
counts generally pay interest monthly or
daily; stocks pay dividends quarterly; most
bonds pay interest semi-annually; and some
options only pay annually. To make a compar-
ison, you must convert the nominal interest
rates to effective interest rates.
For these calculations you would use
PentaCalc Pro's Business calculator, which
contains interest rate conversion buttons.
These buttons figure nominal and effective
interest rates, using either periodic or contin-
uous compounding. To calculate a conver-
sion, click on the appropriate calculator key
for the compounding period: Per for peri-
odic or Con for continuous.
For periodic compounding only, ype in the
number of periods per year and click on the
P/Yr key, Then type in the nominal interest
rate and click on the Nom% key (or the effec-
tive tate and click on Eff%). Finally, click on
the Eff% key to calculate the effective interest
rate (or Nom% to calculate the nominal).
Suppose you are considering three different
investment options: one pays 7.4% annual in-
terest, compounded quarterly; another pays
738%, compounded monthly; and the third pays
732%, compounded continuously. Where
should your business put its money!
From the PentaCalc Pro menu, select
Calc, Financial, and Business to switch
to the Business calculator. Then click on
Options and make sure the following
are selected: Degrees, Fixed 2, Decimal.
and Algebraic.
Enter the first calculation by clicking
on the Per key, yping 4 clicdking on the
P/Yr key, typing 7.4, clicking on the
Nom% key, and then clicking on the
Eff% key to display an effective interest
rate of 761%.
For the second calculation, type 12,
click on he P/Yr key, type 738, click on
the Nom% key, and then click on the
E% key to display 763%.
For the third calculation, click on the Con
key, type 7.32, click on the Nom% key, and
then click on the Eff% key to display 759%.
The second option pays a higher effective
interest rate, and would be your investment
choice.
ADD IT UP Besides its many calculation
options, PentaCalc Pro contains conveniences
such as user-defined hot-keys to bring the cal-
culator to the front of the desktop or perform
actions such as copying and pasting. Just for the
fun of it you can change the appearance of your

the greater the potential loss or damage.
Security-probably no other subject in a
data-intensive environment causes as much
discussion or has the most destructive po-
tential if not handled properly. From a busi-
ness with a standalone computer to the
company with hundreds of networked PCs,
the issue of security must be addressed.
Although companies may spend a great deal
of effort choosing the right hardware and
software, system security often is forgotten
in planning.
A good system allows easy data access for
those with system rights, but makes it difficult
for those who don't belong. System access
boils down to identification and authentication
with user IDs and passwords. Security should
protect against unauthorized access as well as
accidental damage.
CONSIDER YOUR SYSTEM + As a
quick security test on your present com-
puter system, write down what you think
constitutes an acceptable, secure system. If
your system doesn't satisfy all of the cri-
teria, then it's time to think about im-
proving security. Clarifying your business'
security expectations along with a system
training program for employees helps en-
sure and maintain integrity.
Software manufacturers have been keenly
aware of the security issue for some time.
Several protection methods are used to
thwart would-be byte borrowers, from lim-
iting the number of allowable installs to
hardware dongles plugged into your com-
puter's parallel port. These nuisances may

Germs In The Oil Patch
JACKSON, MI-Energy researchers hope in-
visible allies-bacteria-can help them recov-
er oil from underground fields.
Producers have long injected water into oil
reservoirs to push black gold toward wells.
Once the water has swept through the most
permeable layers of sand, however, it contin-
ues to flow through only those layers, leaving
oil trapped in less penetrable regions.
Hughes Eastern Corp. is enlisting germs to
change all that. By dosing water with plant fer-
tilizer, engineers hope to stimulate the growth
of bacteria that will plug the spaces between
sand grains in the water-swept layers. Water
can then be forced through unswept layers.
Workers have already added nutrients to
water pumped into four oilwells near Vernon,
Alabama. In about six to eight months, Hughes

everything is basically in place-torch
fragments, stone tools, fire pits, and
bones. We have well-preserved evi-
dence of all the activities that were go-
ing on in and around these paintings.
And that's critical.''
The most conspicuous artifacts are
large bones, which have been cemented
to the floor by dripping, limestone-rich
water. Specialists have identified them
as the remains of about 40 cave bears,
a ten-foot-tall extinct relative of the
grizzly bear. Also spotted by Chauvet
and confirmed by specialists are the
perfectly preserved footprints of bears
intermingled with the footprints of hu-
mans. There's been considerable spec-
ulation about cave bears and the possi-
bility that they were the focus of some
sort of religious activity,' says White.
''We now have real evidence that we
can use to evaluate that notion.''
Several explanations for Grotto
Chauvet's bear remains have been pro-
posed. In one scenario, the bears wan-
dered into the cave to hibernate and
died in their sleep; the hunters found
the cave full of bones and decorated it
with paintings. This theory is support-
ed by the discovery of bear claw marks
on the wall under some of the painted
animals. Other possibilities are that
bear bones were scavenged and
brought to the cave or that wild bears
were killed on the site. But it is also
conceivable that there is no connection
between the remains and the artwork.
''*There's no guarantee that the pres-
ence of the bear bones had anything to
do with humans,' warns White.
What he finds most intriguing is the
large limestone block in the center of
the deepest gallery with a bear skull on
top of it, ''When humans come into
these places and start picking up skulls
and posing them in specific places, it
starts getting interesting,' he says.
Denis Vialou, a professor of prehis-
toric art at the National Museum of
Natural History in Paris and one of the
few experts so far allowed in the cave,
points out that bones have been found
at other sites, including the famous
Lascaux cave about 150 miles west of
Grotto Chauvet, as well as a cave
Vialou excavated 20 years ago called
Fontanet. ''When Lascaux was discov-
ered they found reindeer bones on the
floor,' he says, ''but on the cave walls,
there is just one reindeer. There was no

j6id: Psychologists say that doing tvo
things at the same time can be much harder than we think.
That's true even when the tasks are simple, Says
University of California at San Diego psychologist Harold
Pashler, Ph.D. A threeyear old might be able to perform ei-
ther task alone. But because of a bottleneck in our brain,
even a NObel Prize winner can't do them simultaneously.
The major hurdle, apparenty, lies in the brain's decision-
making and memoryretrieval systems. When simultaneous
tasks both require us to make a choice or summon a mem-
ory, a mental traffc jam occurs. The second decision must
await completion of the first (although we can act on the
first decision while making the second).
Pasher's work with splitbrain patients, described in
Neuroreport (Vol. 5, No. 1T), suggests the bottleneck oc

The most effective ways of
about other people often involve stereotypes, which
society frowns upon, Forbidden thoughts have an
intuitive quality to them: It's the things we're not
Supposed to think about that often seem most alluring.
They're clearly linked to our decision-making
mechanisms, our ability to distinguish 'right'' from
''wrong,' and our capacity to avoid dangerous,
unfavorable outcomes. They may also be associated
with our creative processes.
However, they can spin wildly out of control. In
extreme cases, forbidden thoughts may become so
powerful that they break out as actual behavior. More
often, though, they get ''stuck,' become virtually
impossible to dispel, and wreak havoc on our mental
and physical health.
Much research has focused on the process of thought
suppression-that is, on the ways we try to banish
unwanted thoughts-and on the consequences of
8uppression. But researchers have also investigated how
and why certain thoughts become forbidden in the first
place. What emerges is an intriguing and complex
picture of the mind, encompassing everything from
genes and neurotransmitters to self-esteem and ''family
values'' Ultimately, the dilemma of forbidden thinking
rests on the courage to believe in ourselves.
CAaY ar CAo
tudies suggest that our individual
vulnerability to forbidden thoughts is
partly inherited, and that some of us are
simply ''wired'' to dwell on worrisome
thoughts, Yet studies also show that
nearly all of us can be made vulnerable
through a variety of external influences-influences
that, in many cases, are intensifying. In fact, some
psychologists speculate that our culture's increasingly
fluid and permissive value systems may paradoxically be
rendering us more vulnerable to forbidden thoughts-
and less able to cope with them.
''At one time, we had much narrower standards of
what thoughts were right and wrong-and nearly
everything was wrong,' says the University of
Washington's Schwartz. ''Today, it's far less clear where
those lines are'' And without those societal boundaries,
many psychologists say, people may be over-
compensating with unrealistic, self-imposed
boundaries-and unwittingly making whole categories
of thought 'forbidden''
This is especially prevalent in the sexual arena. Ours
is a culture that promotes sexual fulfillment and
liberation while simultaneously insisting on restraint
and 'responsibility'' Absent any clear standards for
''healthy'' thinking, some individuals attempt to ban
their own sexual thoughts with such vigor that they
close off an entire sector of experience.
The notion that we somehow create forbidden
thoughts may sound strange. Yet many investigators
argue that what we commonly refer to as ''thought''
doesn't begin as either 'good'' or ''badf' but simply as a
early age, and while still quite young can be
taken outside to pee on the lawn. Dogs are
already learning entertaining tricks while
human children can't do much more than
pull things over on top of themselves. Dogs
are a lot cheaper at every stage of develop-
ment and you don't have to worry about
them growing up, leaving you, and telling a
therapist what a miserable parent you were.
7. You can't expect your children to
serve as cheap labor for you. Some poten-
tial parents are seeking a practical use for
children. Families used to breed children
for labor, to work in the mines or the mills,
and the children were rewarded with a lit-
tle pay and a lot of honor. Growing up in
the country,I had farm work to do and an-
imals to feed and tend, and I loved it be-
cause it made me feel useful. In some parts
of the world, families have seeing-eye chil-
dren for the blind adults. Children are nat-
ural, eager apprentices, excited to learn
whatever the parents know how to do, de-
lighted to follow the parents around learn-
ing their skills. There should be no thought
of having someone around the house who
doesn't share in work needing to be done.
Children, if they are to become adults,
should be functional and proud of it.
Somehow it doesn't work out that way
nowadays, For one, child labor is now ille-
gal, as every child knows, And anyone who
has tried to teach a child to do his or her
chores can immediately see the folly in that
effort. It takes far more effort to get a child
to clean his room or take out the garbage
than it does to do it yourself. I see rich kids
who will cut a deal with their parents and
earn what in other families might be a
weeks wages for washing the car. It is as if
Having a baby with a guy who is afraid of
commitment and family life, afraid of hus-
bandhood and fatherhood, will not reli-
ably bring him closer to you, And if he
doesn't like you very much to start with,
he's not likely to like you better when you
wake him up in the middle of the night to
throw a hungry, wet, feces-smeared,
squishy noisemaker at him.
The most inescapable fact of human bi-
ology is that females can create life from
their bodies and males cannot. Patriarchy
was invented to give men some feeling of
involvement in the creation of life. But be-
neath the patriarchal posturings of male
ownership that cover the sterile shame of
male uterus-envy, there is full awareness on
the part of men that they can never experi-
ence anything comparable to the
mother-child relationship. As a result, men

Psychiatrist Peter Kramer, M.D., au-
thor of Listening to Prozac, a book that
brought him his own measure of fame,
found himself facing a huge media
maw. ''There is so much specialized me-
dia that the amount of material they re-
quire is extraordinary. I was amazed at
the number of outlets on my book tour.
Any small city has cable stations, drive-
time morning shows, women's shows-
you name it. The sheer amount of ma-
terial needed to run the media we
consume is enormous, so you have to
create lots of characters''
In the beginning was the image.
Thirty years ago in his landmark book,
The Image, historian Daniel Boorstin
defined modern fame in terms that have
resonated ever since, ''The hero was dis-
tinguished by his achievement, the
celebrity by his image. The celebrity is a
person well known for his well-known-
ness, We risk being the first people in
history to have been able to make their
illusions so vivid, so persuasive, so real-
istic that we can live in them''
The images, in turn, transmute
celebrities into commodities to be sold
for a price. In Claims to Rime: Celebrity
in ContemporaryAmerica (University of
California Press),Yales Joshua Gamson
quotes 1930s screen star Myrna Loy. ''I
daren't take any chances with Myrna
Loy, for she isn't my property..,.I
couldn'teven go to the corner drugstore
without looking'rightC you see. Not be-
cause of personal vanity, but because the
studio has spent millions of dollars on
the personality known as Myrna Loy''
As our culture generates its endless
images, we are fed more and more in-
formation about people who are less
and less real. There is increasingly tight
control of the image by the image mak-
ers-the publicists, managers, and
agents behind the scenes. Press agents
and publicists arrange the locations of
interviews, channel the discussion into
approved areas, and influence a maga-
zine's selection of a writer by refusing to
cooperate with any scribe they feel will
not benefit the celebrity. A media outlet
that publicizes scathing information
about a star risks alienating a publicist
who controls an entire stable of stars,
The same control is exercised over
photos, as well as copy. Celebrities con-

a step forward. The automaker has reread its
own history and simultaneously tossed aside
several precedents. The 456 GT exceeds the
luxurious creature comforts and elegance of
Ferrari's previous four-seater, the 412. In fact,
the car's elegant accoutrements have been
teamed with the styling panache and perfor-
mance reminiscent of, but surpassing, the dev-
astating 565 GTB/4 Daytona coupe.
The 456 GT 2-+2 boasts a clean-sheet-ofpaper,
442-bhp V-12; a 6-speed transmission; electroni-
cally actuated, fully independent suspension;
four enormous ventilated disc brakes with ATE-
supplied ABS; and a ZF limited-slip differential.
The car's instantly admirable shape is formed
by featherweight aluminum panels welded
(thanks to a unique new process) to a tubular
steel chassis. Lightweight composite materials
form the hood and the headlight pods.
The 456's wonderfully sleek lines are a delight
from any angle. Pininfarina did more than revive
styling cues from the best of this model's prede-
cessors. Careful airflow management over and
under the car is due to the 456 GT's computer-
engineered underbody, cleverlv drawn front spoiler,
and unique Fl-technology-derived moving rear
spoiler, which is integrated into the rear bumper.
These elements help minimize lift at velocities we
can only imagine on U.S. highways.
Inside, there is surprising room for four
adults, highlighted by sumptuous Connolly
leather, brushed aluminum panels, a tall
chromed shifter, and big instrument dials
reminiscent of those in the old 250 GTO.
Sybarites will admire the car's butter-soft match-
ing fitted luggage. Safety advocates will be
made confident by Ferrari's first dual air bag
installation. For clients who prefer not to shift,
a Valeo automatic gearbox is planned, along
with still more luxurious touches.
Most surprisingly, when it was introduced in
Europe, the 456 GT handily outperformed Fer-
rari's flagship, the mid-engined 512 Testarossa.
Although this has changed with the introduc-
tion of the Ferrari 512 M, the point was not lost
on marque aficionados. Now you can have all
the blistering performance for which Ferrari is
famous in a dramatic package that encourages
fast motoring, with a bonus-there's room for
four lucky people.
Ken W. Purdy, who loved Ferraris, would no
doubt be astonished by the performance of this
car-but he wouldn't be very surprised. Ferrari has
done it again. If you have any doubts which car-
maker consistently builds the world's best exotics,
they will be dispelled in five minutes behind the

the saddle as a carrying handle or roll
the bike along on its suitcase-style
CaStOrs.
The bike is parked by swinging the
rear wheel underneath the main
frame, which reduces the bike's
length by half and allows it to stand
on its own. (This is also the first step
in the folding procedure.)
Other useful features include
detachable front and rear carriers that
have compartments for documents,
tools, clothes, etc. The front bag can
hold a briefcase or laptop computer
with virtually no effect on handling,
since the bag is attached to the frame,
not the steering assembly.
The Brompton is available in both a
basic and fully equipped model. The
latter version has a lighting system,
back rack, and five-speed gearing,
none of which affect foldability.

that even many gun owners distinguish between what
they believe is their sacred right to own weapons for
hunting or for the protection of their homes and the
NRA's insistence that that 'right'' allows them to stock
up on the kind of weapons that Colin ferguson used to
spray deadly gunfire in a Long lsland, N.Y., railroad car.
Even in pro-gun Montana, the influential Miaoulian
newspaper editorialized, following aucus' risky vote,
that 'restricting access to these weapons no more in-
fringes on anybody's rights than laws restricting owner-
ship of live hand grenades''
But just as it makes no sense to view the NRA as
King Kong, neither is it Bambi, The organization's
obsessiveness, combined with its take-no-prisoners polit-
ical philosophy, is truly bad news for suddenly vulnera-
ble senators who are clearly in the majority on banning
assault weapons but who hardly need to keep remind-
ing the furious minority of voters of this fact.
No public-opinion poll can measure the emotional
intensity of the millions of Americans who fear for the
fate of their gun collections. The NRA, which counts
3.D5 million dues-paying members, is peopled with the
most dedicated single-issue voters in America. m I994,
according to Gallup and Harris polls, more than 1D per-
cent of all voters - 23 million to 27 million - identified
themselves as NRA members.
Gary Marbut Jr., who looks like a skinnier Dennis
Weaver and meets me at a family restaurant, did not
want to wait for the NRA to launch its national cam-
paign to defeat Baucus in 1996. So Marbut started one
of his own, He tried to get a statewide resolution passed
calling on baucus to resign last year, but this was disal-
lowed by Montanas attorney general, who Marbut says
is a close friend of the senator's. (Marbut's plan called for
a vote during Montanas annual Right to Keep and Bear
Arms Week in early March.) So Marbut threw his
statewide organization, the Montana Sports Shooting
Association, into the effort. Currently, its sole raison
d'&tre would appear to be the political destruction of
Mas Baucus. Raising money through advertisements in
gun magazines, Marbut and company have, according to
his own count, broadcast more than 4,000 antifßaucus

A ratings from the NRA, seven more than the necessary
2I8 votes needed to win. Lest anyone worry that these
votes may not be firm, it should be noted that the NRA
is one organization whose marking system is not prone to
grade inflation.
Even before the Oklahoma City bombing, both the
timing and the arithmetic of the Senate vote looked
trickier.The procedural vote that ultimately allowed the
ban to pass last time around hung by a slender thread.
If Baucus or anyone else had voted no on that initial
vote, the ban would have failed. (Vice President Al
Gore, who can be depended upon to cast the tiebreaking
vote in the Senate when necessary, was busy debating

cient stride. Forcing yourself to increase
this stride length often makes running hard-
er and less efficient because long strides
can create a ''braking'' effect. This doesn't
happen to the Kenyans, however, because
their long strides develop naturally from
their workouts.
When I discussed the stride-length
question with Godfrey, I discovered that this
ability to cover ground so effortlessly results
from simple drills. The Kenyans do lots of
hill running and other exercises that lead to
more explosive footstrikes, longer strides
and, ultimately, faster running speeds.
You don't have to be Kenyan to devel-
op some of the same techniques yourself.
The following workouts will help:

Today, they cover the same topics
while they run. Why? For many reasons.
The psychological and physical benefits vary.
Some enjoy the increased confidence, ener-
gy, muscle and bone strength, endurance
and cardiovascular health that running
bestows. Others run because of what run-
ning helps them lower-their weight, blood
pressure, resting heart rate, anxiety and
depression. Some run for more than one
reason; some started running for one reason
and continue for another, as their goals and
needs change.
Speaking for myself, I run for the love
of it and for all it does for me, from the abil-
ity to compete against others and against
myself to the calming dayin, day-out training
routine that is part of both my physical and
mental health.
When I became a serious runner years
ago, I promised myself that if and when I
no longer found running enjoyable and
rewarding, Id stop. Years later, Im still at
it; I still love it, and I continue to look for-
ward to achieving my running goals. This
love of running is a feeling every woman
can experience.
THE RUNNING LIFE
I run as early in the morning as I possibly
can, before the day comes into full swing.
My running gives me a chance to ''air out''
problems or plans. I review my schedule
and prioritize the day. Sometimes I visual
ize an upcoming race-particularly if it's a
big one.
An early run allows me to feel good
about myself for the rest of the day and to
get my ''fis.'' Coffee doesn't do it for me; its
running that gets me going. If I haven't had
my run, TTm irritable. I feel sluggish and
inept in dealing with daily activities. After I
run, I feel I can deal with just about anything
that comes my way-whether its a business
call, getting my daughter out the door to
school, keeping my son amused or all of
them simultaneously.
Life is truly a balancing act. In one
hand, you hold your running, and in the oth-
er, you hold your job, family and other tasks
and challenges that you face on a daily basis.
For all the things that are important in your
life, you have to find that balance.
Wih all I do in my ife, Im still trying
to keep my balance. Its an endless challenge
in my ife, as well as in the ives of so many
women I know. In fact, when the Melpo-
mene nstitute for Women's Health Research
in St. Paul asked women what, if anything,
kept them from running as much as they'd
like to, the numberone obstacle named was
lack of time because of workplace demands,
followed by lack of time because of family
responsibilities.
Only you can decide how to create a
harmonious balance. Ultimately, only you
know your body, your psyche and the
demands in your ife. It may take a while to
find that balance, but you'll know when it's
achieved. And when you do, it's ike a good
race, ike the runner's high.
WHAT WORKS FOR YOU
One of the early lessons I learned as an ath-
lete is the need for flexibility. Athletics, ike
everything else, is a trialand-error process.
You stay with what works, you discard what
doesn't Thats why flexibility is an important
ingredient in any training program.
This has ahvays been true in my career,
but perhaps nothing has tested that truth
like my two children: my seven-year-old
daughter, Abigail, and fiveyearold son,
Anders. Since they were born, Ive had to
change my training radically (and subse-
quently, often my goals). In doing so, I have
learned that some things work and some
don't, When Abby was born, for example, I
thought I could continue to train twice a day.
But I was just digging myself into a hole.
After a few weeks of frequent feedings and
sleep deprivation, I had to give up that sec-
ond run, It is a change that has remained
permanent. Now I work to make my one run
a day a quality run.
IIf youre not flesible when you start out,
its a trait you acquire by necessity. Before
children-B.C.,I call it-I would have said I
could never be satisfied unless I ran twice a
day at least five days a week. Cutting back,
however, left me energized, not fatigued;
renewed, not burned out. That's the beauty
of this sport-its adaptable.
No doubt about it, combining an athlet-
ic career with motherhood definitely has its
ups and downs. To do well at both, I have
established my own personal set of priorities.
For any woman runner, priorities determine
how you spend your time, attention and
energy. I do tend to become more focused,
and a bit more selfish, when Tm training for
a major race, for example. For the most part,
other than my training time-and barring
meetings or travel--I spend my time with
my children.
Also essential to fitting running into
your lifestyle is developing a sense of
wholeness. Unless you feel happy about
yourself, as integrated as possible, you can't
expect to have success in anything-from
running to mothering to any other job. I
cannot stress enough how great an effect
this has had on both my personal and pro-
fessional ife.
There's not a better feeling than when
you have found that moment of balance and
harmony when both running and life come
together. Then you truly know why you run
and that you couldn't live without it,

Pwo silver medals are proudly
i displayed in Vhginia Poyner's fam-
ly room in Franklin, Indiana. Poy-
ner, 51, won them at the World
Duathlon Championships in '92 and
'94, 'Our age group is very, very com-
petitive,' says Poyner, the numberone-
ranked U.S. female duathlete in the
50-54 age category.
Fitness is a fulltime job for the
grandmother of two. Besides teaching
aerobics and weight training at a health
chib, she serves as fitness director at a
drug and alcohol rehabilitation center
for women, ''Working out is a big part
of the women's recovery,' says Poyner.
''Their selfconfidence really blossoms.'
Poyner says her own turning
point in athletics dates back to just
before her 40th birthday and her
retirement from teaching. That's when
she fulfilled her goal of running a
marathon. ''After that race,' she says,
''I wanted to tackle an even bigger
challenge.''
Ten years and 250 awards later,
Poyner has found her niche in du-
athlons. In the last four years, she's
qualified for Team USA and placed in
the top four in her age group at the
world championships. Says Poyner,
''This is such a treat in later ife.''
ture sensors further revealed convec-

layers, The ocean's workings seemed to
be following the patterns we had ob-
served in the laboratory.
Still, the overall vigor of salt fingering
my colleagues and I encountered dur-
ing C-SALT was somewhat lower than
we had anticipated. Also surprising to
us was that Williams's optical device
showed the fingers to be tilted far from
vertical by the changes in velocity
(shear) between layers. The weaker mix-
ing seems to have resulted because the
interfaces proved to be a few meters
thick rather than a few tens of centime-
ters, as we had expected from labora-
tory experiments. More sophisticated
physical models recently developed by
Eric Kunze of the University of Wash-
ington account for the thickness vari-
ations and the effects of the vertical
shear on the ocean's salt fingers.
Measurements made during C-SALT
also highlighted an important thermo-
dynamic difference between salt fingers
and ordinary ocean turbulence. When
turbulence from waves and eddies mix-
es the upper ocean, it distorts the nor-
mal temperature distribution as it con-
verts some of the kinetic energy of the
Surface movements into potential ener-
gy in the thermal structure (by lifting
dense parcels of water and depressing
light ones). Some of this kinetic energy

Saltfinger mixing can in theory also
arise within stars and in the atmo-
spheres of gaseous planets. Will space

ones, Creation of so-called pixel detec-
tors with this capability is a very active
area, One variety, under development
at CERN and elsewhere, is the hybrid
pixel detector. The detector chip in such
instruments is fabricated in much the
same way as a strip detector, but the
strips are replaced with a two-dimen-
sional array of small squares or rectan-
gles (the pixels), typically 50 to 500 mi-
crons on a side. This chip is sandwiched
to another one carrying a correspond-
ing array of amplifier/signal processing
elements such that each pixel is con-
nected to one of its elements via a set
of conducting bumps.
Pixel detectors are planned for the in-
nermost layers of the charged-particle
tracking systems of the big LHC experi-
ments. Close to the collision region,
with its extreme density of particles,
track recognition and reconstruction
will be best accomplished with the fine-
granularity, space-point measurements
possible with pixel devices.
Another possible use of pixel detec-
tors, still at an early stage of develop-
ment, is in xray radiography for medi
cal imaging, especially mammography.

paintings, faces, dates and names that
gradually covers the screen, Once in,
you can take an audio tour of how to
use the disk, watch a brief movie about
Roy Neuberger (you learn that his focus
was on ''buying the work of living art-
ists''--particularly in Paris in the 1920s
because ''good times cause things to

The disk's graphic interface is attrac-
tive but somewhat confusing. Rows of
similar-looking thumbnail buttons rep-
resent many different things: the art-
works, photographs of the artists, anec-
dotal movies, text about the works, art-
ists and social events of the period. The
user can uncover more buttons (and
hence more choices) by clicking on ar-
rows at the end of the rows. Once you
have chosen a painting, for instance,
you can request to see links, which calls
up a vertical column of new buttons
next to the work. This setup of hyper-
links creates a great many ways to cir-
culate through the collection, but the
material on the CD-ROM is finite, so
you will soon run into the same materi-
al from a number of different routes.

Made in the light of hydrogen alpha

lar material representing distinct phases
of mass loss,
In April's Astronomical Journal Mar-
ston discusses the several phases of
Wolf-Rayet evolution implied by these
rings. First, the fast stellar wind of the
main-sequence precursor, a massive O
star, clears away the interstellar material
around it. This results in a shell of
swept-up gas and dust. When the O star
exhausts its core hydrogen fuel and
swells into a giant, it goes through a
mass-ejection phase, partially filling the
cleared-out bubble. During this phase
the star may gently slough off its outer
envelope as a red supergiant or eject
mass in spurts as a luminous blue vari-

the glass and warp it, will blow off dew
for perhaps five or 10 minutes. Then
you have to use it again. And again, A
12-volt auto windshield defogger gun is
somewhat less effective. A better way
is to apply a little heat continuously.
Heated dewcaps that run off a 12-volt
battery are advertised in this magazine
(one system was reviewed in the May
1994 issue, page 51.) Or with just a lit-
tle electrical know-how you can make
an antidew heater to any size, shape,
and specification you want, as de-
scribed in the box on the next page.
Warmed optics can have unexpected
benefits. Dew works its first subtle evils
before you notice anything. The late Wal-
ter Scott Houston used electric warmers
on both the objective and eyepiece hold-
er of his 4-inch refractor, When he turned
off the power, the telescope could lose a
whole magnitude of light grasp before the
objective actually looked dewy.
''Even on nights when dewing is not
noticeable,' Houston wrote, ''the star
images seem better with the heaters on
than without them!'' This may be be-
cause, contrary to what you might think,
gentle heating keeps a telescope close to
the temperature of the surrounding air,
After all, the whole idea is to stop it
from growing colder than the air.
NOTSO-COLD STORAGE
The most destructive dewing happens
when a telescope is in storage. No tele-
scope should be closed up and put away
until it is thoroughly dry. Water with
nowhere to escape, or condensation that
forms and evaporates repeatedly in a
Sealed environment over months and
years, may attack optical coatings and
ultimately etch the glass itself.

For instance, have you ever seen a red
dwarf? These most abundant of stars are
surprisingly hard to find, since they are
intrinsically so dim. Proxima Centauri,
famous as the closest star to the Sun, ap-
pears lost in the Milky Way swarms at
magnitude 11.1. Barnard's Star in Ophi-
uchus, the nearest star visible from mid-
northern latitudes, is magnitude 9.5. The
next closest is Wolf 359 in Leo, magni-
tude 13.5. Not until we come to the
fourth closest red dwarf do we find one
that's visible even in binoculars.

the better guides we reviewed-that will give you a
rough idea of what to expect, Keep in mind, these
numbers are based on a two-parent family with two
kids, For a more exact estimate of how much aid you
may receive, see the work sheets in the College Costs

Board (Henry Holt S( Co., $16. To order a copy call

When you finish the work sheet, you should have
enough information to make some important deci-
sions, Most readers will probably find that their sav-
ings and estimated financial-aid awards won't cover
all tuition costs, Indeed, because most financial-aid
packages include loans as part of the package, some
borrowing will more than likely be part of any tuition
equation, Parents not wanting to borrow as much as
the work sheet estimates may decide to cut back on
certain areas of the household budget. Others, who
discover their retirement savings are below what they
should be, may decide that borrowing is the best way
to make up for tuition shortfalls.
THE SMARTMONEY
PORTROLKOS
SA VING FOR COLLEGE is a schizophrenic pursuit.
On the one hand you've got to invest aggressively
enough to accumulate thousands of dollars by the
time your child is ready for school. On the other hand
this is your child's future we're talking about: You
can't afford to lose one penny of principal.
The SmartMoney strategy directly addresses this
inherent dichotomy in tuition planning. Our three
model portfolios should provide an average annual re-
turn of 12 percent over 18 years, Yet we've included
investments that post those gains without taking ex-
traordinary risks.
How does our strategy achieve these two seem-
ingly opposite goals? Part of the reason is that we have
:edefined the conventional wisdom on how parents
has been met so far, Look, rather, for Congress to tackle
the problem once again, either trying to solve it by fiat,
meaning forced centralized storage sites, or relaxing
the deadlines for disposal.
The former is unpalatable. But if dumps are not man-
dated, won't the radioactive waste ''crisis'' be made
worse? The fears are played upon by both sides, To re-
lieve the threat to the public, proponents would quickly
move the waste underground. Opponents would just as
soon see the waste back up while repositories are debat-
ed, and choke the front end of the process, that is, shut
down nuclear power.
What no one is debating is the health hazard itself.
Nuclear waste in its present modes of storage is not
very dangerous, The fuel rods are safe in the cooling
pools of power plants; as the pools fill up, the rods are
being moved to concrete casks, The casks, emitting
great heat but little radiation, are held on-site, (Utilities
don't like this stopgap, of course, and are suing the fed-
eral government for not taking their high-level waste.)
Likewise, the barrels of TRU, guarded behind fences at
DDOE reservations, aren't threatening anyone at the mo-
ment. DOE stores high-level liquid wastes there too,
some of it in leaky underground tanks. The pollution so
far is being contained on the sites,
It is the hospitals and private generators of low-level
waste that are the most pressed for space, Waste at one
California research facility nearly caught fire after the
1994 earthquake. Urban fires, earthquakes, floods--
that's the low-level-Awvaste failure scenario, although the
same risks applied when the hospitals' and private com-
panies' storerooms and warehouses were less full, Still,
many may give up their licenses if no solution is found.
At all such facilities of interim storage, workers' expo-
sure to radiation is monitored. The limit is 5 rems per
year, and in practice the average worker receives about
300 millirems. Leaving aside the meaning of the terms,
the question is whether the workers' risk of cancer is ac-
ceptably low. Most scientists think so.
The exposure limit for the public living near these fa-
cilities is set 50 times lower than the occupational stan-
dard. Is the public also being protected against cancer?
Most scientists think so. One's risk never disappears en-
tirely, Zero risk, like zero radiation, is unattainable.
It takes a trust in the authorities, admittedly a tall
order in suspicious times, If one can trust the current
protection standards, backed by inspectors with Geiger
counters and doctors with health studies, then the nu-
clear waste can stay where it is until society comes to a
consensus, It's a concern, not an emergency.
As the controversy rages, spent fuel rods from nuclear
power plants smolder in cooling pools like this one.
Samaj, broke off relations with the
Theosophists, His organization hoped
to unify India under the banner of
Hindu revivalism and denounced the
society's embrace of all religions, At
one point, Samajists distributed leaf-
lets in Bombay attacking Olcott and
Blavatsky as untrustworthy foreigners
interfering in Indian affairs.
When A. P. Sinnett published a book
of letters he said he had received from
Madame Blavatsky's Masters, a clergy-
man confronted Madame with evi-
dence that one letter was plagiarized
from a sermon of his that had been
published in an American Spiritualist
magazine. Anglo-Indian journalists
rushed to satirize Madame's astral
communications system.
Theosophical headquarters were
moved to Madras at the end of 1882,
and for a time public controversy died
down, The Colonel took up the lecture
tours again. While in London in 1884
he learned that the British Society for
Psychical Research, an organization
dedicated to the study of paranormal
phenomena, wanted to investigate the
Theosophical Society's activities. The
group included philosopher Henry
Sidgwick, as well as politician Arthur
Balfour (who would become Britain's
prime minister in 1902) and physicist
Lord Rayleigh.
Their attention had been caught by
a sensational article in the Times of Lon-
don, Emma Coulomb, the housekeeper
whom Madame Blavatsky had earlier
defended, claimed to possess letters
from her employer instructing her to
fake many of the mysterious happen-
ings that had attracted so much con-
troversy. Coulomb published these let-
ters-which the Theosophists insist to
this day were forgeries-in the maga-
zine of Madras Christian College. For
years the society had sparred with the
missionaries. Now the men of the
cloth, it appeared, were about to get
their revenge.
In one letter, Madame Blavatsky re-
portedly instructed Coulomb to dis-
play a bearded, life-size doll in the
moonlight so that it could be taken for
he could not openly criticize her dur-
ing the SPR investigation. To do so
would have damaged his own reputa-
tion for integrity and further risked the
good name of the movement to which
he had dedicated his life.
The investigation nearly destroyed
the Theosophical Society. Madame
Blavatsky, who usually deflected criti-
cism with her famous wit, insisted on
suing for slander, Colonel Olcott, ordi-
narily a jovial and easygoing adminis-
trator, refused to back her lawsuit,
fearing even more public embarrass-
ment for the society. Accusing him of
treachery, she retreated to her quar-
ters in a rage and announced that she
was on her deathbed.
She was, in fact, suffering from a se-
rious liver ailment and nervous ex-
haustion. Colonel Olcott arranged for
her passage on the first ship bound for
Europe. On March 31, 1885, too weak
to walk, she was hoisted in an invalid
chair onto a steamer waiting in the
Madras harbor. She was never to re-
turn to India. Except for one brief, un-
easy meeting in London, she would
never see Colonel Olcott again.
But to the astonishment of her crit-
ics, Madame Blavatsky's career as a

SWAT commanders and administra-
tors in the seminar. The more they
know about us and what we do, the
better. Here is a chance to teach them
to respect our skills. It is also a golden
opportunity to sell them on the need
to get us more training and equip-
ment,'' Bartlett explained.
Following the seminar was the
Sniper Team Shoot-out, a two-day
event that pitted sniper teams against
one another in a variety of challeng-
ing courses. Each course was designed
to test the team's tactics, decision
making, teamwork, conditioning, as
well as marksmanship. Also tested
was their ability to function under
pressure. In keeping with the
Snipercraft philosophy that snipers are
more than just shooters, there was
also a written exam to test observa-
tion skills and general knowledge of
their trade.
''Given a quality rifle, anybody can
learn to lay in a comfortable position
and shoot bull's-eyes,'' Bartlett ad-
mitted. ''A sniper worthy of his title
is much more than a marksman. But
as a marksman, he is expected, be it
unrealistic or not, to be perfect under
pressure. In our competitions we be-
lieve in applying all the pressure we
can. The weather, the physical exer-
tion, the head-to-head competition,
performing in front of your peers and
the very nature of our fire courses all
add up to make this a formidable chal-
lenge. Succeed here, and you have
accomplished something you can
build confidence on. Pass these tests
and the real thing becomes just an-
other day on the range.''
The competition was always fierce
but friendly, each team openly
cheered for others to put forward a
good effort. Downtime was spent
search studies from wound bal-
listic laboratories. The table shown
here well illustrates the less-than-
lethal characteristics of ''assault
weapon'' wounds.
And the reality of Black Talon
wounds? Martin Fackler, M.D.,
former chief of the Army Wound
Ballistics Laboratory, has exposed
the voodoo wound ballistics of
ignorant physicians and has stud-
ied the Black Talon. Fackler's
research shows that Black Talon
performs exactly like any other
hollowpoint handgun bullet, ex-
cept in the last 4 of its 18 inches
of travel, where the cutting effect
is a more efficient wounding
mechanism than crushing. For
example, in its last few inches
of travel, a standard hollowpoint
might only bruise or stretch an
attacker's artery, but Black Talon's
sharp edges might cut the artery
causing the attacker to hemor-
rhage profusely and collapse,
ending the attack sooner.
If Black Talon is marginally
more effective in stopping power
and less likely to ricochet, isn't
that what self-protection is all
about - stopping a vicious as-
sailant, without allowing non-ex-
panding and over-penetrating
bullets to wound innocent neigh-
bors or bystanders?
Prohibitionist physicians have
planted fear that the sharp edges
of Black Talon bullets might pierce
a surgical glove and injure a sur-
geon, increasing the risk of AlDS
and hepatitis - but it is not a
surgical axiom that bullets must be
handled or removed. Additionally,
since the AlDS epidemic began,
'universal precautions' (wearing tNo
layers of surgical gloves or wearing
Kevlar gloves) are SOP. If we worry
the nasty sharp edges might cut a
surgeon despite those precautions,
remember that surgeons regularly
handle sharp objects.They are called
''needles,'''scissors' and 'scalpels.'

Ruth and Dennis could hardly
claim to be unlucky with other
plants, however. The poppies are just
one part of the river of plants that
swirls around the house, spills down
the slope in back, and flows into the
woods beyond. Countless roses, iris,
moss pinks, columbines, Johnny-
jamp-ups, daylilies, wallflowers, one
of this, a few of those-an amazing
horticultural zoo spread over 10
acres, Although the property has
been in Ruth's family for more than
100 years, the garden is only 10
years old, give or take a year, ''There
was very little planted-just around
the house-when I came back to
Georgia,'' Ruth says, gesturing.
''Some boxwoods, daffodils-the old
butter and eggs kind-and old-
fashioned and species iris. We plant-
ed everything else.''
Dennis emerges from the woods

Anlpple from Teacher
As tax-cut fever threatens school budgets
across the country, many districts are
finding it increasingly difficult to fund in-
terscholastic sports, Last week New York
City's board of education announced that
itwould eliminate eight junior varsity pro-
grams, And in early April the school
board in Hamler, Ohio, voted to require
students to pay to play-$150 to partici-
pate in one sport, $120 more for the sec-
ond and an additional $90 for the third.
So far no one in New York has offered
a solution to the 6,500 students who
would be affected. But in Hamler, 38
coaches from the Patrick Henry School
District will forgo their normal stipends
for one year if the district can't make up
the shortfall. That would allow almost 375
kids to continue playing for free. The dis-
trict figures to save almost $90,000, and
each teacher will lose between $1,300 and
$4,000-but their gifts to their students

editorial cartoonist John Caldwell, we're grateful to be reminded that rates of
acceleration sometimes apply to something other than greed. In the May issue of
Phics Today, Yale professor Robert K. Adair not only assures us that curveballs
still curve and line drives still slice, but also explains precisely why.
Adair says that because a baseball usually travels between 60 and 120 mph, a
speed that's neithcr unusually fast nor unusually slow, the game is played
oefuddlingly between ''two aerodynamic regimes,'' This, combined with the
raised stitches on the ball, makes for baseball's occasionally vexing exceptions to
ahat would normally be tidy natural laws. In summing up, Adair sounds more
than a little like that laureate of convoluted logic, Yogi Berra.''Simple matters,''
he writes, ''are not always easy.''
cut that they concluded was the result of
one of the attacks and described her as
''very truthful.''
Yet in the days following Brenda's visit
with the police, a number of things hap-
pened-and didn't happen-that explain
how a coach might beat his wife for years
with impunity. In his interview with po-
lice, Dan, after denying most of Brenda's
account of the incident, raised concerns
about publicity and ''the reputation of the
football team.'' For some reason Johnson
assured McCarney and his lawyer that the
sheriff's office ''would not notify the me-
dia of this investigation,'' the report said.
Dan had already called Brenda to say that
if she went public with the latest incident,
he would lose his job and she and their
children would be without support, ac-
cording to the report. Brenda, who hadn't
worked outside the home since 1990,
soon secured a restraining order but
didn't press criminal charges.
Last March, after a Des Moines Register
account of the private life of Iowa State's
new football coach forced the university
to launch a reevaluation of its decision to
hire him, Brenda and Dan released a joint
statement. In it they denied that there had
been anything more than that single inci-
dent, With her estranged husband having
signed a contract worth as much as
$300,000 a year, the scenes from their
marriage that Brenda had recounted to
detectives a year earlier suddenly hadn't
happened, No, there had never been that
first beating just before the July 1986 mar-
riage. Nor had there been one, as she had
previously reported, five days after the
birth of the first of their three children,
Jillian, in '87, when Dan slapped her face
as she held the baby. Nor had there been
an incident that Brenda said had occurred
on Super Bowl Sunday in '93, when she
suffered a bruised cheek and black eye af-
ter confronting her husband about an af-
fair. The Iowa State administration says it
will honor rather than eat Dan's five-year
deal--and Brenda will collect the $3,600-
a-month support payments she was grant-
ed soon after Dan got the job with the
Cyclones.
Similarly, the Coxes appeared together
Monday at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadi-
um to read a joint statement denying that
Bobby had struck his wife and calling the
incident an ''argument'' that ''became
heated.'' Pamela appeared to have a slight
bruise on her left cheek. In response, the
commander of the Cobb County uniform
division, Col. J.D. Arrowood, said the po-
lice stood behind their report.
Coaches have suffered from stress
since long before Ohio State's Woody
Hayes slugged an opposing player in the
1978 Gator Bowl, before Northwestern
basketball coach Ricky Byrdsong took his
bizarre midgame stroll into the stands in
1994, But stress is only one element in a
mix that can lead to excessive drinking or
violence. An occupational need to control
is another. ''Coaches want to be in con-
trol,'' says Todd Crosset, a former swim-
ming coach at Northeastern who now
teaches in the sports-management pro-
gram at Massachusetts. ''But the people
we reward for making decisions are ulti-
mately not in control, When the game be-
gins, the athletes are on the field.''
Many coaches have coped sensibly with
stress, calling timeout in their careers
when the pressure became too much to
bear. But as a group, coaches may be at
higher risk than men in other profes-
sions-not because they're coaches but
because of the traits that coaches are like-
ly to have. ''People like police officers,
military people and people in sports-ca-
reers where competitiveness and aggres-
siveness and control are dominant and
valued-tend to get involved in spousal
abuse,'' says'Toby Willner, coordinator of

vocates in New York City.
ability at every position. If we could take
two teams to the Pan American Games,
we'd finish first and second.'' It is the day
after the naming of the national team that
will win the gold medal in Argentina, and
its pitching staff, in particular, is a happy
embarrassment; Zabala ticks off four of
the nation's top pitchers before getting to
Rolando Arrojo, ace of the Cuban league
champion team, Villa Clara, who went

Zabala says, deadpan. ''We won 15-2,''
It is a terrible time. Squeezed by an eco-

tered blue Lada station wagon. He had his
food, he had his Golden Age, he had

He is away from it now. But the best relief
pitcher in Cuban history still can't be sure
what to say, whom to trust, how to be-
have. He squints, ducks his head into his
shoulders. On the escape boat, which was
buoyed by four empty 55-gallon oil
drums, the good water ran short, and he
was so thirsty, he drank from the sea when
his wife wasn't looking, and he kept row-
ing, rowing. Experts believe that only
40% of those who leave Cuba in rafts sur-
vive the journey. What if his boy or wife
had slipped over the side? Euclides Rojas
would never have forgiven himself; he
would've killed himself, maybe. He sits in
this nice house on the edge of the Ever-
glades, sure of this: He would never put
his family through that again. They were
picked up after 4V days at sea, 67 miles
out of Cuba, by a Coast Guard vessel with
three numbers painted on the side.
''Seven-two-one,'' Rojas says, ''I'll nev-
er forget it. At least we weren't going to
drown. We saw a lot of empty rafts, After
we were picked up, I saw a woman in the
water, all bloated.''
He and his family spent six months in-
terned at Guantänamo, his son wheezing
with a constant lung ailment. They had
dropped into the sea off Havana's Morro
Castle at 1l p.m. on Aug. 17-when U.S.
policy still would've allowed them to en-
ter the country-but on their third day
out, President Clinton directed that all
refugees be sent to the base. Finally, in
February, all three Rojases were allowed
something is missing. Police on horseback
aren't ringing the field, no one fears his
car will be roasted in a U.S-style flame of
''celebration,'' the announcer doesn't
threaten hooligans with arrest. When it's
over and Villa Clara is champion of Cuba,
the crowd simply flows onto the diamond
to dance. Mesa is grabbed by dozens of
hands and lifted high; grinning, he is
tossed over and over into the air. A song
plays: Villa Clara is the champion....
Dont stop.... Go on, go on, Now Mesa is
back on his feet; neighbors and friends
and people he has never met come to hug
him, and he hugs back. There is no threat,
no fear. The last time a win was celebrat-
ed so purely? In the U.S., maybe Pitts-
burgh, Bill Mazeroski, 1960. In Cuba,
maybe last year.
''This means a lot, because it's my prov-
ince,'' Mesa says, ''It's where I live, where
people take care of me.'' He sits in the
it,'' Preston says. The drivers are in a
93-cubic-foot sealed enclosure built
into the wall below the stairway lead-
ing into the great room. ''I checked to
see if I could improve performance by
adding a vent,'' Preston notes, ''but I
discovered that short of using a vent
large enough for my three-year-old to
climb through, there wasn't much to
be gained.'' Remarkably, nothing vi-
brates, not even the stair railing.
The Preston family theater is cen-

woman writes a book and delivers a chapter
a day to the man she's dreamed of for
years, who turns out (say the biographical
notes) to be the author of The Story of O.
Even without that information, in this song
you get inside a character's head in a way
you never do in others. Then again, maybe
this is just a more interesting head. A.N.

attend a three-week seminar this sum-
mer that will explain the curriculum they
will implement in the fall. One obvious
change is that there will be no textbook
for the class, since traditional texts do
not fit the new approach. Instead,
Aldridge's group is creating its own
instruction manuals for teachers and
work packets for students, The materials
will pool information and experiments
from different science books that are
consistent with the group's content stan-
dards,The teachers will also require stu-
dents to do a considerable amount of
outside reading. Teachers will identify
articles in popular science magazines,
newspapers, science books, even science-
fiction novels.
Students will be given a set amount of
time each week in class to discuss obser-
vations that they have made in their own
lives, For example, they might ask how
the colors of the sunset are made in the
sky every evening, whether Alka Seltzer
dissolves faster and more completely in
hot water, or why a microwave oven
cooks food so much faster than a con-
ventional oven.
Finally, lab experiments will take on
greater importance. The focus will be on
allowing students to devise experiments
to help answer their own observations.
For example, they could set up an exper-
iment to compare how Alka Seltzer dis-
solves in water at different temperatures.
The teacher could then use the results as
a springboard to discuss relevant science
concepts.
Aldridge believes that once these pilot
projects begin to show results, the new
concepts will become the norm. ''By the
year 2000,'' he predicts, ''we're going to
see a noticeable change in thousands of
schools around the country,''

THE ROLE OFA NEW
MACHINE
Doe Teinolgy Dr4ellstoi?
Editelby Merritt Roe Smi and Lb) Marx
MIT Press, $1695in paper
BY G. PSCA.ZA'HARY
Ti+e parade of ''new and im-
i proved'' products is so rapid to-
i day that those who track tech-
&L nological change are usually too
busy sorting through them to confront
larger questions about the relationship
between technology and culture. Yet
much of what provokes anxiety about
technological change is precisely the
inability, or perhaps the unwillingness,
of sponsors, inventors, promoters, and
consumers to confront those questions,
None is more important, none causes
more worry or even fear, than the view
that machines make history, that our
tools and technologies determine the
nature of our society.
This view, termed ''technological
determinism,'' has long seduced both
academics and the public. In the intro-
duction to a new collection of essays
entitled Does Technology Drive His-
toryf, Merritt Roe Smith, a historian at
MTT, locates the source of technologi-
cal determinism in ''the early stages of
the Industrial Revolution,'' when, ironi-
cally, the notion inspired not fear but
hope. Supported by relentlessly upbeat
advertising, ''technology became idol-
ized as the force that could fix the econ-
omy and deliver on the legendary
promise of American life,'' he writes,,
Advertisers pitched their products not ]
simply as fixes for specific needs but as ]
a means to health and happiness, By the ]
early twentieth century, ''technology ]
had ... become the cause of human ]
well-being,'' Smith observes, Technolog- !
ical determinism took even deeper root
by mid-century, with weapons of mass
destruction perversely underscoring the
capacity for inventions to make history.
However, the 1960s proved to be a
watershed for technological determin-
ists, Leo Marx, a professor of history at
MIT, finds in his essay, For many peo-
ple, the Vietnam War, and the later mis-
calculations that produced acid rain,
Chernobyl, Bhopal, and the possibility
of global warming, have led to the con-
clusion that technology per se does not
drive history after all. Rather, the driving
force is seen to be the decisions people
make about how to use technology.
There has been a growing realization
that ''high technical skills may serve to
mask ... the choice of ends,'' Marx
writes, Though technological determin-
ism has hardly faded away, this other
way of thinking has begun to gain ascen-
dency, Both academics and citizen-
activists have urged closer scrutiny of
technical choices and a consideration of
the ways in which powerful sponsors
can influence specific innovations.
For help in explaining the social pres-
sures acting upon technology, histori-
ans and sociologists have drawn on a
theory called ''social constructivism,''
which calls attention to a mountain of
previously ignored evidence that shows
how different cultures have reacted in
vastly different ways to the same inno-
vation. For example, why did farmers
in the American Midwest embrace new
seeds and cropping techniques earlier
this century while Chinese farmers,
when given the same opportunities, did
not? Why did television spawn a cornu-
copia of commercially driven program-
ming in the United States while in the
Soviet Union the same medium served
up drab, state-controlled shows? Such
case studies amount to a convincing
rebuttal of ''hard'' technological deter-
minism, a stance epitomized by Karl
Marx's famous maxim: ''The hand mill
gives you society with the feudal lord;
the steam mill, society with the industrial
capitalist,''
Social constructivists have also illu-
minated the ways in which individuals
create technologies that reflect their
own biases and needs. Technologies as
diverse as household appliances, mis-
sile-guidance systems, and computers
have resulted from a myriad of social
choices, with innovators facing open-
ended turning points, The first digital
computers, for instance, were greatly
shaped by the pressures of World War
II, when the military needed to perform
more quickly the voluminous calcula-
tions entailed in charting bomb trajec-
tories, Absent these pressures, engineers
might have stressed from the start the
computer's awesome ability to produce
images on a TV screen, Each path was
open, but because of human choices,
the number cruncher took precedence
over the image maker.
In Does Technology Drive Historyf,
the social constructivist perspective is
taken for granted. Indeed, most of the
contributors are unabashedly impatient
with the still-popular notion that tools,
as opposed to styles of mind, define a
civilization. Peter Perdue, a professor of
history at MIT, demolishes the influen-
tial argument historian Lynn White
makes in his 1962 classic book Medieval
Technology and Social Change-that
the heavy plough led to the rise of north-
ern Europe's manorial economy, in
which land was consolidated into large
at it long enough to find a grain of truth
on which to hang our ''objective''
response. In some cases, such as in the
Wall Street ournal, Newsweek, and the
Boston Globe, that response consisted
of picking up on Murray's lament that
his theory was wrongfully dismissed by
serious scholars such as psychologists
Howard Gardner of Harvard, Robert
Sternberg of Yale, and Richard Nisbett
of the University of Michigan not
because it is unsupported but because it
is politically incorrect, Some journalists
went so far as to quote Murray, saying
that clear-headed scientists agreed with
his theories in private but would not
speak out for fear of disturbing the
equal-opportunity police.
''The science behind Tlbe Bell Curve is
overwhelmingly mainstream,'' wrote
Geoffrey Cowley in Newsweek. ''In
short, cognitive inequality is not a politi-
cal preference. It's a simple fact of life.''
Cowley provided evidence of this in the
form of a 1984 survey in which 53 per-
cent of social scientists agreed that ''the
black-white gap involves genetic as well
as environmental factors,'' But that find-
ing indicates only that a modest majority
of social scientists think genetics as well
as environmental factors influence intelli-
gence. The Bell Curve, by contrast, con-
tends that genetics swamps environmen-
tal effects to such a degree that different
ethnic groups must approach life with a
whole different set of expectations,
If political correctness has anything
to do with serious critiques of Murray's
ideas, it is not a lot. Social scientists are
not so sure that intelligence can be mea-
sured by any single test, or that it should
be-and many are sure that it cannot
and should not be measured this way.
In any case, even psychometricians, psy-
chologists who make their living quan-
tifying intelligence and designing intelli-
gence tests, would not agree that intelli-
gence based on a single measure (what
Tbe Bell Curve calls ''g'')can prove one
group's intellectual superiority over
another. That is Murray's idea,
All this was made painfully clear by

tion, they will need to come armed with
more than a couple of sharpened No. 2
pencils and a firm grasp of derivatives;
they will also require the latest that math
technology has to offer. Under new rules
set by the College Board, all students who
take the test must have a hand-held
graphing calculator. Those who lack this
powerful machine, which graphs complex
equations, will have to sign a waiver
stating that they will not challenge
their scores if they do poorly on the exam
because they do not use a graphing
calculator.
To apostles of the ''calculus-reform
movementC' who advocate learning
through technology, graphing calcu-
lators are to calculus students what mi-
crowave ovens are to popcorn lovers;
once the device is used, there is no go-
ing back. ''If you don't use this tech-
nology, then you're really teaching as
if you were in the 1940s7 says Judith
Broadwin,an A.P. math teacher at Jeri-
cho High School in New York. ''The
few people who object to this do so
because they're afraid of it''
Other teachers, many of them in
public schools, protest that the Col-
lege Board is rushing to embrace
new technology without considering
the many students who cannot afford
an $80-to-$100 calculator. And the
effort required to learn how to use it,
some teachers believe, far outweighs
the benefits. ''The students grow de-
pendent on a machine to do all the
work for them,' says Joan Harrison,
who teaches A.P. math in Durham,
NorthCarolina.''And T'm driven nuts
because Im having to spend valu-
able class time trying to get the stu-
requirement on the basis of, among other
things, discrimination.
Wade Curry, director of the Advanced
Placement Program for the College Board,
insists that students and teachers have
been given ample opportunity to obtain
and learn to operate the new calculators.
Texas Instruments, the largest supplier of
the machines, has helped finance training
sessions for teachers and has provided
some 2,000 calculators to 300 schools at a
25%-to-30% discount. Says Richard
Schaar, a vice president at TI: ''Equity is
certainly a critical issue, but the graphing
calculator is a relatively affordable solution
to the need for equipment and technology
in the classroom. Think about a computer
system. How many graphing calculators
can you get for the cost of a PCF''

TEST RUN: Students work with the calculator
Nightmover ended on the morning of
Feb. 21, 1994, when Ames left his house in
Arlington, stepped into his Jaguar and
drove into an FBI roadblock a short dis-
tance away. The arrest of Ames and his
wife came one day before he was sched-
uled to leave for Moscow on CA business.
The FBI was not about to risk Ames' going
to Russia and perhaps never coming back.
Slouched in the back of the car that took
him to the bureau's office at Tysons Corner,
Virginia, Ames repeated to himself again
and again,''Think ... Think ...Think.' He
knew that all sorts of incriminating doc-
uments, including computer disks and
letters to the KGB, were in his house and
in his computer. It was over.
ON APRIL 28, 1994, AMES WAS SENTENCED
to life in prison. The very next day, he was
brought to the Tysons Corner FB office for
debriefing. Officials would begin the
process of questioning him fully about his

Ames nodded to her. ''Hi, Jeanne,' he

who had puthim and Rosario in

Ames made an opening statement. He
had participated in a number of debrief-
ings on the other side of the table, and he
would handle this one in a professional
manner, as he would have done if he were
still in his former role, The debriefers went
the session, which lasted a few hours, and
ate two sandwiches. The questioning went
on as Guerin led Ames through the history
of his espionage.
Then the debriefing took a dramatic
and unexpected turn. Ames explained
how worried he was in late 1985 and early
1986 when the Soviets so swiftly arrested
the agents he had betrayed. He had talked
to the EGB in Rome about it and said that
the sudden loss of agents might lead the
CIA to look for a mole and jeopardize his
safety. The Soviets had asked, What can
we do to help youf Is there anyone you can
blame? They suggested that if Ames pro-
vided the name of another cA officer, then
the KGB would plant clues that the inno-
cent person was the mole. The officer
would be framed.
Ames looked at Jeanne Vertefeuille,
who sat across the table from him.

''but I gave them your name.''
would be delayed until April 1996-after
the critical Christmas buying season. Sega,
which apparently was making its plans
around Nintendo's original schedule, sur-
prised everyone by announcing that its
new 32-bit Saturn would be available im-
mediately instead of in September. Sony,
no stranger to the stratagems of consumer-
electronics marketing, neatly parried with
its own surprise: a pre-emptive price cut
on the PlayStation-before the official list
price was even set-to $299. That posi-
tioned the game system well below the
$399 list prices of the Sega and 3DO
machines and only slightly higher than the
32-bit processors and double-speed
cD-rOM. drives with sufficient
capacity to store VHS-quality
fog. Nintendo wowed viewers

out without suffering the usual loss of
clarity.
With all this new power, the medium
might seem to have a lot of potential, but
few game developers last week showed
any sign that they were interested in
exploring it. The games on display-even
on the new systems-were depressingly
unoriginal. Most boiled down to a couple
of thugs (male or female) slugging and
kicking it out, or to various vehicles racing
through a maze of one sort or another,
avoiding obstacles and obliterating any-
thing that moves. A typical title in this
genre: a 3DO game called Hell: A Cyber-
punk Thriller.
Even with the price cutting that start-
ed last week-and is likely to continue
through the holiday season-the systems
are still far too expensive to tempt con-
sumers used to paying $100 or less for a
game machine with plenty of good soft-
ware, 'fWe do not believe there is a mass
market for any machine that costs over
$200,'' says Dan Lavin, a senior analyst at
Dataquest, a market-research firm based
in San Jose, California. 'None of these
The biggest villains in the movie,
however, are the media, especially local
TV newscaster Wayne Satz, who early
on reported the ghastliest accusations
against the McMartins with sensational-
istic relish. From talk-show hosts to
newspaper reporters, the media avidly
portrayed the McMartins as torturers.
Even Ray Buckey's lawyer Danny Da-
vis-played intriguingly by James Woods
as part camera-ready opportunist, part
righteous upholder of justice-presumed
the McMartins guilty at first.
So too did Myra Mann and her hus-
band. ''I reacted like everybody else,'
she says, ''I thought,'God, what people.
They looked rather sleazy. Later on I re-
alized it was because they hadn't slept.
They were in terror.'' The Manns have
been obsessed with the case since 1986,
taking it as a personal crusade. In fact,
they became participants in it. After
Glenn Stevens, one of the prosecutors
(played in the film by Joe Urla), quit the
case because he felt the McMartins were
being unfairly targeted, Myra Mann be-
gan to tape what would turn out to be 30
hours of interviews with him. She even-
tually turned over the tapes to the court
and was called in to testify about them in
a pretrial hearing. She wound up spend-
ing every day of the two trials (which
spanned three years) in court as an im-
passioned observer. While they were on
the set of the movie last December, the
Manns' Los Angeles house mysteriously
burned down in what police confirm
was arson: the Manns believe it was re-
lated to the case.
Indictment has already raised an
outcry among children's advocacy
groups, In a press release, the American
Professional Society on the Abuse of

ance and is ''dangerous in its potential
for fueling unjustified skepticism about

tor Theresa Reid has not seen the film,
she has read the script and cites as her
main concern ''the implication that fan-

by Gonzalez, who cited it as the main
reason for his resignation.
''The measures..,put Guatemala at a
disadvantage.. especially with El Sal-
vador,'' says Gonzalez, who had advo-
cated lower tariffs, ''What we have to do
is try to avoid all costs for the transaction
of [goods]. The duty is only a cost in this
process and doesn't help increased
growth of exports.''
Guatemala's trade with the United
States, its largest trading partner, last year
increased by 5.2% over 1993 to more
than $2.6 billion, according to the U.S.
Department of Commerce. Trade should
grow again this year at about the same
level, Guatemalan and U.S. officials say.
Top U.S. exports to Guatemala, which
reached $1.35 billion last year, included
nuclear reactors, boilers and machines;
apparel articles and accessories, mineral
fuel and electric machinery. Top U.S.
imports from Guatemala, which reached
$1.3 billion last year, included apparel
articles and accessories, coffee, edible
fruit and sugar.
Best prospects for U.S. business
include computers, hotel and restaurant
equipment, food-processing and packag-

tools, and security and safety equipment,
according to the U.S. Department of
Commerce.
''Guatemala is so oriented toward U.S.
products that U.S. companies have an
advantage from the get-go,' says a U.S.
Commerce Department official.

Reserve requirements
The government has required banks to
Imeet new reserve requirements of
60% of past due loans or 4% of total
loans, whichever is larger. The moves
come in response to the weakening of
Mexican banks following the peso de-
valuation.

which allows GE Capital to decide by
September 1996 whether to remain a
shareholder, must be approved by
Mexican authorities.
Cinema profits down
Cinemark USA Inc., a Dallas-based
theater owner, said earnings were down
28%, largely because of a US$900,000
loss linked to its expansion in Mexico.
Cinemark has four theater complexes
in Mexico and plans six more this year.
Insurance expansion
Chubb Corp. is expanding its hold-
ings in Mexico. The Warren, N.J.,
company increased its ownership in
Central de Fianzas to 100%, chang-
ing the name of the surety and bond
fidelity company to Chubb de Mex-
ico Compaiiia Afianzadora. Chubb
also increased its holdings in insur-
ance company Seguros Equitativa
by 3% to 30%; the name was changed
to Chubb de Mexico Compaiiia de
Seguros.
Dollar payout
Investors redeeming tesobonos will be
paid in dollars. Officials hope the move
will take pressure off the peso because
the dollars will be paid out of foreign
reserves, avoiding the currency market.
Investors had been redeeming
tesobonos in pesos and buying dollars
with the proceeds, which impeded ef-
forts to help the peso recover.

and acquire transport vessels.
Analysts say that points to an economic
slowdown. Economy Minister
Domingo Cavallo said inflation will
not top 3.5% in 1995. Fears are that
this will mean lower, or perhaps nega-
tive growth.

Manufacturing. But despite the suc-
cess in agricultural exports, the
strongest growth and revenues have
been generated by exports of garments
and textiles assembled in maquila
plants. The two products increased from
about $30 million in 1987 to $211.5
million last year.
''We're a very small country that
doesn't have significant natural
resources,' says Gonzalez. ''But our geo-
graphical position should [help us] be
trans-shippers and traders.''
One of the main assets Guatemala
offers is a large, hard-working labor force
with an attractive salary level compared
with the United States, Guatemalan offi-
cials say.
''Our labor is very well-qualified to do
maquila-type jobs,'' says Giancarlo
Ibärgiüen, general director of real estate
developer Grupo Marbensa. ''We have a
very skilled artisan population, and those
are very good skills to have in maquila,
so that's a big advantage.'
Guatemalan authorities estimate the
maquila industry employs approximately
80,000 people. California-based Levi
Strauss is the largest employer, with
7,000 employees. Other top U.S.
investors include Van Heusen. As much
as half of the industry is owned or oper-
ated by Korean companies, Guatemalan
and U.S. officials say.
The de Leön government views the
maquila industry as key to generating
jobs, especially in the rural areas, Gonza-
lez says. ''With 40% unemployment,
basically in the countryside, what [the
government is] aiming at is generating
massive employment, and there it's prin-
cipally the maquila that... can achieve it,''
he says.
Mexico effect. However, the industry
is seeing a slowdown because of a com-
bination of factors. Gexpront reports that
72 maquila companies closed last year,
leaving the total at 328. That's down
from the high of 500 in 1991, but still
eight times higher than in 1986.
The slowdown started in 1993 with
charges by U.S. unions that the
Guatemalan maquila industry was under-
paying and overworking its employees,
charges denied both Guatemalan and
U.S. officials. ''The Guatemalan
maquilas offered better wage and work-
ing conditions than many other sectors of
the economy and significantly helped
improve overall living conditions in the
country,' says the U.S. AID consultant.
lLast year also saw increased competi-
tion from neighboring Mexico, which,
through NAFTA, exports textiles to the
United States duty free. Mexico's attrac-
tiveness compared with Guatemala's
increased with last December's peso
devaluation, Gonzalez says.
Prospects. Other problems affecting
the sector include insufficient infrastruc-
ture, transportation costs, hijackings of
cargo and other crime, Gexpront says.
Yet optimism reigns.
''While a return to the 100 percent
growth rates of the past are no longer
likely, the industry should be able to sus-
tain growth rates of 20-plus percent a
year,' says the U.S. AID consultant.
Guatemalan officials and business
leaders estimate that if non-traditional
exports grow at an average of 22% per
year over the next five years, total non-
traditional exports will reach $2 billion,
creating an additional 380.000 jobs.
''There are thousands of opportuni-
ties,' says an optimistic Santano.

says Michael Kramer, Sea-Land's direc-
tor of marketing for the Americas and,
until recently, the carrier's manager for
Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.
During late 1993 and early 1994, Sea-
Land and other transport companies suf-
fered a wave of cargo hijackings in and
out of Guatemala's top port, Santo
Tomäs. After implementing counter mea-
sures such as convoys with guards, the
hijackings declined significantly. To off-
set the increased costs, Sea-Land added a
S200 fee for each container carried
through Guatemala. Kramer and other
executives suggest the government use
the police or army to increase security
and controls on the roads leading to and
from the port.
Pat on the back. Most U.S. compa-
nies operating in Guatemala express opti-
mism over the future. ''Guatemala is its
own worst critic,' says DHL's Davison.
''They should be patting themselves on
the back for their accomplishments.''
Adds Julio Ligorria, president of the
communications division of Guatemala-
based Delta Consultores: ''The country is
clearly moving in the right direction, with
election of an activist gun-control ad-
ministration and the recent passage of
the Brady bill and a ban on certain
semiautomatic weapons have heated
the discourse to white-hot intensity.
Some believe the 1994 weapons ban
eventually will provide the Supreme
Court with an opportunity to make a
definitive statement on the amend-
ment. Wayne LaPierre, executive vice
president of the NRA, says his organi-
zation is looking for some sort of suit-
able test case right now. ''Let's get it

the Supreme Court and have it out,''
But given the passion of the issue and
the deep cultural divide that lies be-
neath it, a definitive high court ruling

conflict as it is to put it to rest.

signed his NRA life membership last
week to protest the organization's esca-
lating antigovernment diatribes.
lmage implosion. Since the Oklahoma
City bombing, the NRA's reputation
and legislative agenda have taken some
unwelcome hits. With majority support
in the House of Representatives and
powerful support from the likes of
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole,
er Newt Gingrich wasn't having
any of it, ''To every Democrat who
wants to be responsible, we are
prepared to sit down and work
with you,'' he said. ''But we're not
going to tolerate and take without
fighting back totally irresponsible
adolescent behavior.''
Despite the strong words, Re-
publicans now privately worry
that the Democratic assault on
their budget could grow deadly.
In fact, polls show that a majority
of voters would consider slowing
the growth of Medicare spending
as a breach of the pledge not to
cut Social Security. ''The truth is,
we wish we could have done [this]
after 1996,'' says a top House Re-
publican staffer. Even so, at least
one key Republican strategist says
he's not worried because he be-
lieves Clinton has abdicated any
claim to leadership. ''To say there
is no governing vision of the
Democratic party is an under-
statement,'' asserts William Kris-
tol. ''It's even worse than George Bush
was in 1992''
Big shifts, As the partisan rancor rises,
Republicans insist that they are only
snipping around the edges of the federal
colossus. Total federal outlays- about
$1.5 trillion this year -would rise to $1.9
trillion in the year 2002 under Domeni-
ci's plan, rather than $2.2 trillion if cur-
rent law remained in effect. Of course,
those numbers obscure big shifts within
spending categories. Social Security,
Medicare and Medicaid, which account
for just over one third of federal spend-
ing, would continue to grow faster than
total government spending, simply be-
cause of demographic trends and health
care inflation. Outlays for defense, about
one fifth of the budget, would decline
slightly. And spending on nondefense,
nonentitlement programs, which repre-
sentroughly 20 percent of the budgetand
include everything from highways to for-
cign aid, would slip 13 percent over the
next seven years, according to the Center
on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal
Washington research group.
For all their specificity, the Republi-
can budget plans still leave some ques-
tions that will have to be answered as
the debate unfolds. Kasich's plan, for
example, assumes that Washington will
save $52 billion from reduced growth in
pension and Social Security outlays af-
ter the Bureau of Labor Statistics recal-
ibrates its consumer price index, used to
calculate cost-of-living increases in
those programs. But the bureau hasn't
said how much it will actually change
the price index, and economists differ
widely on the likely adjustment. The
plan proposed by Domenici counts on
$143 billion in five-year savings off the
projected growth in Medicare. But just
how those savings will be achieved is
left to a bipartisan commission yet to be
appointed. Notes Allen Schick, a bud-
get expert at the Brookings Institution
in Washington: ''In politics, the dirty
work is done by commissions.''
The central political struggle of the
summer may be over whether to in-
:lude a tax cut in this year's congres-
sional budget. Clinton's plan contains a
ive-year $63 billion tax cut aimed at
'amilies with children at home or in
;ollege. The Kasich tax package costs
$189 billion over five years, but bal-
oons to $630 billion over 10 years be-
:ause many of the tax cuts are ''back
loaded.'' Domenici did not include a
tax cut in his blueprint, arguing that
deficit reduction must come first. But
in a nod to colleagues Bob Dole of
Kansas and Phil Gramm of Texas, who
are advocating tax cuts as part of their
positioning for the 1996 presidential
campaign, Domenici said that if deficit
reduction produces lower government
interest payments or higher govern-
ment revenues, the ''fiscal dividend''
could be used to finance a tax cut.
Gramm wants to offer an amendment
for a tax cut similar to the House tax
package, although at this point he
doesn't have the votes. Senate Majority
Leader Dole, who has promised that
he will pass a tax cut this year, could
well propose a plan of his own, possibly
phased in over a few years,
''How do we stay competitive,'' muses
Wiggenhorn, ''without killing every-
body?'' Others question whether the in-
tensified effort will cause employees to
become too inward looking. During its
quality push, Motorola concentrated so
hard on reducing defects that some cus-
tomers became dissatisfied because they
felt the company was ignoring their
needs, To restore balance, the company
launched the Total Customer Satisfac-
tion campaign. Finally, not every Motor-
ola training course is a rousing success.
Curtis Plott, president of the American
Society for Training and Development,
argues: ''There are many business prob-
lems for which the solution is not train-
ing.'' When several Motorola business
units supply a single corporation, for ex-
ample, they need a unified strategy.
That's an organizational issue that can't
be addressed through training.
The best judgment so far, however, is
that Motorola has avoided overtraining
its employees, mainly by aligning educa-
tional efforts with business needs. And
there is growing financial proof at the
company that continuous learning may
be one of the smartest investments em-
ployers and employees ever make.

New YorkCity. He hasshown thewaybyenforc-
ing two simple reforms in the city and state program for
dble-bodied, childless adults called Home Relief.
Step No.1is effective screening. Applicants return for
um extensive interview a week after applying for benefits.
ixperienced caseworkers review Social Security num-
er, place of residence, assets and income and ask what
he applicant has been doing. A caseworker then does a
ome visit to check the accuracy of a given address, and
xther information is tested against information in com-
puterbases. Here isthe big news: Near-
ly 50 percent of rejected applicants did
not reside at the address they gave; 5.5
percent did not even have an address.
Only nine of the several thousand peo-
ple rejected for false addresses came
back and claimed an official error. A
number had unreported incomes or
were not who they said they were. One
man who said he was eligible turned
out to be living in a $1,500-a-month
apartment with more than $14,000 in
the bank, One woman fled the welfare
office after giving a false name; it
turned out to be that of a welfare fraud
investigator in New Jersey where she
lived and had been prosecuted.
What was astonishing was that so many people lied.
The Giuliani program found that nearly 60 percent of
the 18,000 who applied over the first three months were
not eligible. Just identifying people who did not merit
full support saved the city nearly 5 percent of outlays.
The second stage of the Giuliani method is work.
Eligible, able-bodied people are required to look for a
job during the 45-day application process and make 40
job contacts over that period. Those who don't find
work are required to work for New York City for an
average of 23 hours a week, producing quality-of-life
improvements in public places. The prospect of work-
ing for the city seems to have prompted 3V times as
many eligible applicants to find jobs during the applica-
tion period as had found them the year before. The
work requirement has also produced a 27 percent re-
duction in the number of initial applicants, which is
saying something, since this year the weather has been
mild and last year there were 17 major snowstorms that
limited the number of applicants. Those working off the
books who did not wish to give up their work for welfare
gave up welfare instead. Others decided it made more
sense to find a real job that would pay better than the
average Home Relief grant of $325 a month.
Westchester County, a neighbor of New York City,
was first in the state to try the combination sandwich of
front-end evaluation and workfare. It found substan-
tially fewer people merited welfare. Over a five-year
period, including a recession, Westchester welfare cases
increased by only l percent, while other counties' went
up 25 percent to 30 percent.
New York promises to save much of
the $2 billion cost of its Home Relief
program when these new standards are
applied to the 244,000 Home Relief
beneficiaries already on the rolls. And
the city has not stopped there. It will
soon start a finger-imaging system to
ensure that nobody double dips for
benefits under different names. Last
year, random fingerprint tests showed
that about 25 percent of the 1,500 peo-
ple tested were double dipping in both
New York and New Jersey-a much
smaller proportion than those who are
double dipping in different counties
within New York State.
New York's program has restored integrity to its sys-
tem without denying benefits to those truly in need.
Indeed, it has helped to make benefits more secure
because they are more defensible. Yet for years now,
anyone expressing concern over waste, fraud and abuse
in the welfare system has been automatically tagged an
insensitive oppressor of the poor. Die-hard welfare ad-
vocates, of course, are not impressed. They consider any
denial of benefits as cruel and any added steps to deter-
mine eligibility as unfair. But President Clinton, who
supported this program and its wider applicability to
other states and cities, has a better grasp of its relevance
to trust in government. ''Anytime you can reduce the
number of people on any public program who aren't
qualified to be on it,'' he said, ''[you] bring a sense of
integrity, and taxpayers don't feel they are being ripped
off.''Now let's apply the same technique to the far larger
welfare programs that operate under federal rules. e
immensely impoverished after her first
flush of material well-being. It wasn't
just the disappearance of her milieu-
that was obvious-but the feeling that
she had, somehow, been had. The Amer-
ican supermarket tomatoes didn't taste
at all like the rare genuine item back in
Romania. American chicken was taste-
less. Mass-produced furniture was built
to fall apart. Her car, the crowning glory
of her achievements in the eyes of folks
back home, was only three years old
and already beginning to wheeze and
groan, It began to dawn on my mother
that she had perhaps made a bad deal:
She had traded in her friends and rela-
tives for ersatz tomatoes, fake chicken,
phony furniture.
Leaving behind your kin, your
friends, your language, your smells, your
childhood, is traumatic. It is a kind of
death. You're dead for the home folk
and they are dead to you. When you
first arrive on these shores you are in
mourning. The only consolations are
these products, which were imbued with
religious significance back at home. But
when these things turn out not to be
the real things, you begin to experience
a second death, brought about by
betrayal. You begin to suspect that the
religious significance you attached to
them was only possible back home,
where these things did not exist. Here,
where they are plentiful, they have no
significance whatsoever. They are inan-
imate fetishes, somebody else's fetishes,
no help to you at all. When this real-
ization dawned on my mother, she
began to rage against her new country.
She deplored its rudeness, its insensi-
tivity, its outright meanness, its indif-
ference, the chase after the almighty
buck, the social isolation of most Amer-
icans, their inability to partake of warm,
genuine fellowship, and, above all, their
deplorable lack of awe before what they
had made.
This was the second stage of grief
for her old self. The first, leaving her
country, was sharp and immediate,
almost tonic in its violence. The second
was more prolonged, more damaging,
because no hope was attached to it. Cer-
tainly not the hope of return.
And here, thinking of return, she
began to reflect that perhaps there had
been more to this deal than she'd first
thought. True, she had left behind a lot
that was good, but she had also left
behind a vast range of daily humilia-
tions. If she was ordered to move out of
How technology created the urban underclass
The story of automation's impact on
African-Americans may be prophetic of
what lies ahead for the rest of the work-
force. In the early years of the 20th cen-
tury more than 90 percent of the black
population of the United States still lived
below the Mason-Dion Line, and the vast
majority was tied to agriculture.
Then, in 1944, an event took place
in the rural Mississippi delta that was to
change the circumstances of African-
Americans forever. On 0ctober 2 an esti-
mated 3,000 people crowded onto a cot-
ton field just outside of Clarksdale, Mis-
sissippi, to watch the first successful
demonstration of a mechanical cotton
picker, The onlookers were awed by the
sight. Each machine could do the work of
50 people. For the first time since blacks
had been brought over as slaves to work
the agricultural fields in the South, their
hands and backs were no longer needed.
The push of mechanization in South-
ern agriculture combined with the pull of
jobs and less overt discrimination in the
industrial cities of the North to create
what Nicholas Lemann called 'one of the
largest and most rapid mass internal
movements of people in history.' More
than 5 million black men, women, and
children migrated north in search of work
between 1940 and 1970.
AIthough most African-Americans
were unaware of it at the time of their
trek north, a second technological revo-
lution had already begun in the manu-
facturing industries of Chicago, Detroit,
Cleveland, and New York that once again
would lock many of them out of gainful
employment. In the mid-1950s, automa-
tion began to take a toll in the nation's
factories. Hardest hit were unskilled jobs
in the very industries where black work-
ers were concentrated. Between 1953 and
1962, 1.6 million blue-collar manufac-
turing jobs were lost. In The Problem of
the Negro Movement, published in 1964,
civil rights activist Tom Kahn quipped, 'It
is as if racism, having put the Negro in
his economic place, stepped aside to
watch technology destroy that place.''
Companies started to build more
automated manufacturing plants in the
newly emerging suburban industrial parks.
Automation and suburban relocation cre-
ated a crisis of tragic dimensions for
unskilled black workers in the inner cities.
The newly laid interstate highway system
and the ring of metropolitan expressways
being built around cities favored truck
over train transport of goods, providing
a further incentive to relocate plants to
the suburbs. Finally, employers anxious
to reduce labor costs and weaken unions
saw relocation as a way to create dis-
tance between plants and militant union
concentrations in urban neighborhoods.
Eventually these same anti-union feelings
pushed companies to locate plants in the
South, in Mexico, and overseas.
The corporate drive to automate and
relocate manufacturing jobs split the
black community into two distinct eco-
nomic groups. While many blacks were
able to take advantage of the loosening
grip of outright discrimination and join
the middle-class mainstream of American
life, millions of unskilled African-Ameri-
can workers and their families became
part of what social historians now call an
underclass-a permanently unemployed
part of the population whose unskilled
labor is no longer required and who live
a marginal existence, often as welfare
recipients or in the underground econo-
my of drugs and crime.

aided and abetted the literary delinquency of minors. On
MTV Liz Phair, Lemonhead Evan Dando, and Speech of
Arrested Development have dusted off their freshman-
comp notebooks and shared their wit and whimsy with
celebrity-conscious scholars across America. While it
might seem incongruous that the channel most responsi-
ble for shortening the American attention span would sud-
denly promote something akin to book learning, reduc-
ing the soliloquy to a sound bite is actually in keeping with
MTVs agenda of serving as a cultural Cuisinart. Besides,
by committing airtime to such purportedly vocabulary-
expanding fare, MTV can claim that it offers ''educa-
tional programming'' next time some congressman tries
to blame a serial killing on Beavis and Butthead.
hough today's plugged-in poets think they've dis-
i covered fire, Rock Lit actually has a rich and
i bilarious history, which begins where so many
other pop music shaggy-dog stories do: with the
Beatles. In 1964, as sales for Beatles-related chazzerai
went through the roof, a cunning British publisher com-
missioned John Lennon, ''the smart Beatle,'' to write a
book. Few accounts remain, but the story might have
gone something like this: As his deadline approached,
Lennon panicked, having committed to paper only some
random backstage ruminations. When the fateful day
finally arrived, Lennon turned in several notebooks full
of sloppy sketches and nonsense verse. The publisher,
having already spent millions of pounds promoting the
book, had no choice but to release it. Everyone, includ-
ing Lennon, was prepared for a massive critical and com-
mercial disaster.
Remarkably, In His Own Write was a sensation on
both sides of the Atlantic. ''He writes like a Beatle pos-
sessed.... Inspired nonsense,'' proclaimed the New York
Timmes Book Review. Lines like '''Speak up, come forth,
you ravel me, I I potty menthol shout'' brought frequent
comparisons to Lewis Carroll, Edward Lear, and the
author of Ulysses, although hindsight reveals Lennon's
style to be more Joyce Jillson than James Joyce.
Nevertheless, in March 1964 In His Own WYite won the
prestigious Foyles Literary Prize. In his acceptance speech
Lennon mumbled, ''Thank you very much, you've got a
lucky face,' then fled. He was now, as Paul would later
sing, a ''paperback writer.''
Bob ''Get sick, get well, hang around an inkwell''
Dylan was actually the first rock personality to be treat-
ed as a literary figure. He laid the groundwork by chang-
ing his surname ''Zimmerman'' to ''Dylan'' in honor of
Dylan Thomas before dropping out of the University of
Minnesota. Once his recording career was under way,
Dylan was celebrated as a messiah for his fanciful lyrics
alone; the New York Times called him ''the poet laureate
of young America.'' By 1966, though, Dylan had been
upstaged not only by Lennon but also by the publication
of Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me, a novel
by his friend and fellow folksinger Richard Farifia, who
was killed in a motorcycle accident before he could go
electric and get baptized. Stung by his competitors' break-
throughs, Dylan rose to the challenge and signed with
Macmillan.
Although he told interviewers his manuscript was
Dylan finally agreed to publish Tarantula in 1971 without
Bobs ''changes.'' Needless to say, after more than half a
decade of hype the results were disappointing, prompting
the publisher to include a preface practically apologizing
for the book: ''Bob has always been out ahead, working
in ways which can be hard to understand.'' Those read-
ers not blinded by bathtub acid were completely befud-
dled, and the book met with overwhelming critical dis-
approval.
But reviewer reprobation was rare. By and large, the
only negative assessments that greeted rock performers'
printed expressions came from doddering holdovers in the
mainstream media. Elsewhere, musicians-cum-muse
chasers sallied forth and an entire publishing industry
rose up to boost their literary efforts. Thus was born the
''rock critic,'' a pop-culture oracle whose mediation was
needed to interpret the increasingly baroque blathering
offered up as entertainment.
In 1968 came the book that would become the essen-
tial text in defense of the new pop literature: Richard
Goldstein's The Poetry of Rock. Essentially a reprinting
of song lyrics by artists as various as Phil Ochs, Paul

to infiltrate a J.D.L. splinter group
known as sou (Save Our Israel Land),
whose members were suspected of hav-
ing set off bombs in an effort to thwart
a peace accord. Fitzpatrick has said he
undertook the role because it was the
''moral thing'' to do. Wearing a body
mike, Fitzpatrick gathered information
that led to the arrest and conviction of
two Jewish militants, Victor Vancier
and Bruce Berger, for plotting the
bombing of the Egyptian tourist office
in New York, After the indictment of
Qubilah Shabazz, Vancier-whose truth-
fulness was questioned in 1979 by a
federal judge-told reporters that he
and others had wanted only to cause
property damage but Fitzpatrick had
urged them to kill. According to
William Kunstler, Fitzpatrick not only
egged on the soIL members-supplying
the dynamite while saying he hoped
it would kill or maim--but was also
promised more than $10,000 by the
F.B.I. for his work. Dan Scott says
Fitzpatrick was a young idealist who
saved lives at a delicate time--perhaps
a hero.
After the Vancier-Berger trial, Fitz-
patrick was enrolled in the federal wit-
ness-protection program under the name
jewelry, leather jackets, fast cars, and
gaming tables, Gordon wrote, and he
once mentioned that he had gone to
school with Malcolm X's daughter. He
said ''she was not a close friend. He
said she was a quiet loner who drank
by herself often.'' Gordon says she was
intrigued by Fitzpatrick's intellect and
ability to ''grasp complex scenarios.''
But she found him ''kind of a thug,'
''too slippery.''
Fitzpatrick was married a second time,
for eight months, in 1991. He went to
work for several gold and rare-coin deal-
ers but filed for bankruptcy in April
1993, with debts of more than $70.000.
In October 1993, he left a suburban-
Minneapolis employer called Investment
Rarities--the company told police he was
fired-and a dispute ensued over whether
he had given or sold the names of cus-
tomers to competitors. A police com-
plaint report said Fitzpatrick had threat-
ened to 'expose'' the company's prac-
tices, and claimed to be in the witness-
protection program ''for killing a mafi-
oso.'' In November 1993, Fitzpatrick and
others were arrested on drug charges
at the Minneapolis apartment of Har-
lan Rosenfeld, another coin dealer. Be-
sides crack pipes and other drug para-
passion that men like Pennant-Rea seem
capable of lavishing only on their mis-
tresses (and only when they have no in-
tention of leaving their wives). For ex-
ample: ''Very dearest ME, yesterday has
left me warm and loving, where once I
was closed down and cold. Thank you
for that, with all my heart.'' Within two
weeks, he would sign another letter
''with eternal love.'' Soon afterward he
wrote, ''I was thinking back to a lunch
when you were there.... You were
looking very austere in black. The
knowledge that I now possess--that you
probably weren't wearing any knickers-
was wonderfully distracting'' He seemed
to relish the illicit nature of the affair.
On May 21, he wrote, ''An outsider
would say that what we are doing is
crazy: distance, danger, everything is
against us. And part of me would have
to agree with that view.''
While this was going on, Pennant-
Rea's Economist was supporting antiin-
flationary economic policy and, to the
bitter end, the ultimately disastrous ex-
change-rate mechanism in Europe. Staff
members remember his peculiarly vigor-
ous support at this time of David Mel-
lor, a Tory minister who'd had to resign
after trouble over a mistress and other
things. In 1993--about a year after Mary
Ellen had moved to England-Pennant-
Rea was, astonishingly, appointed to the
number-two job at the Bank of England.
Ordinarily, this would have been filled
by someone from within. But at No. 10
Downing Street the feeling ran deep that
an outsider was needed to provide a
fresh perspective and to serve as a coun-
terbalance to Eddie George, the bank's
very forceful governor. And so Sarah
Hogg, now working as the prime minis-
ter's chief policy adviser, reached out to
The Economist and tapped her old friend
for the job. Eddie George wasn't in-
formed until the last minute.
It was an awkward fit. Not only did
Pennant-Rea have little supervisory
banking experience, but he was the
most reviled kind of outsider, ''The
bank doesn't really approve of journal-
ists, or the way journalists think, or the
way they do their job,'' said Stephen
Fay, the author of Portrait of an Old
Lady a book about the bank published
in 1987. ''It believes in discretion, ma-
nipulation-'m thinking in terms of
defining an objective and chasing it rig-
orously. They like to think of them-
selves as being single-minded.'' What
were Pennant-Rea's qualifications for

Continuing to read, Love tries to wrap
her daughter in the white robe that bare-
ly clings to the edges of her breasts.
Handing me the doll, Frances Bean
climbs higher on Love's lap and hangs
on every word. The child places her
tiny hands on her mother's cheeks and
listens to the last lines read to her in
that ragged, loving, rocked-out voice.
''The spell was broken,'' her mother
finishes, knowing the lines by heart,
ple: ''a swaggering, tough little slut.''
Love's Kinder-slut persona is primed
and ready by the time I catch the last
leg of a recent Hole tour in Salt Lake
City. As I wander around the temple
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat-
ter-Day Saints, located in a 10-acre
square in Salt Lake City, I can't help
but wonder who will show up for Hole's
concert tonight. The young people here
are so well scrubbed and polite that
I can't imagine them singing along with
anything other than Mormon hymns.
Stationed around Temple Square are
lovely young girls from all over the
world, referred to as ''sisters,'' who
are doing their missionary work for
the church. Flight attendants for the
ancestral angels of this faith, they pi
ously dispense information about the
holy pioneers who settled in this val-
ley in 1847.
Even in Salt Lake City, it turns out,
Courtney Love and Hole can pull in
a crowd. ''Hers is the heart of the
rock 'n' roll audience,' Danny Gold-
berg, who once managed Nirvana as
well as Hole and is now chairman
and C.E.O. of Warner Bros. Records,
tells me. ''You meet 14-year-olds and
they're all into Hole. It's not just a
cult. It's not just colleges. It's not just
critics. She's appealing to the heart
of the MTV mainstream rock audience.
It's not just based on one song. It's
her. There are very few women who
have ever done that.... My daugh-
ter, Katie, who is four and a half, of-
ten says she wants to be like Courtney
when she grows up,' Goldberg con-
tinues, laughing nervously.
'''m a Courtney Love fan because
I think she's a woman who goes be-
yond the limits of anything to say what
she wants to say and to do what she
wants to do,'' a chubby teenager named
Holly tells me just before the concert
begins in a small hall on the shore of
the Great Salt Lake. Along with hun-
dreds of other sweetfaced girls and
tough-talking boys, she is getting revved
up for her idol's entrance. ''I think
she's been through hell and back,' says
Holly. ''And she's surrired!''
Suddenly the crowd lets loose with
a pulsating roar. I look up and see
Love, in a girlishly pink getup, stag-
ger onto the stage full of Stoli and a
couple of weeks' worth of road-weary
attitude. Her band-the beautifully
aloof bass player, Melissa Auf der
Maur (who replaced Kristen Pfaff af-
ter her death from an overdose of hero-
in last year), guitarist Eric Erlandson
(his stoicism tested tonight by the news
of his father's death), and drummer
Patty Schemel (calm, kick-ass, the keep-
er of the rhythmic flame)--grab their
instruments and wait for Love's
signal to let the music rip. Hold-
ing a stuffed Barney dinosaur in
one hand and a Dunhill ciga-
rette in the other, she pauses to
stare down at the throng of row-
dy boys crowding the stage be-
low her, then smirks at their crude
innocence and drops the Barney
amid the trademark array of
broken dolls that adorn the stage
around her. (Love's song ''Doll
Parts'' has become the latest
teen anthem for pubescent girls
terrorized by their own tender,
morphing bodies.) Ready to
mosh-an activity that entails
pushing, shoving, and lifting per-
formers or audience members and
passing them over the heads of
the crowd--teenagers of both
sexes are screaming obscenities
at her. One boy even has the
audacity to shout out that he loves
her. ''How do you know you
can love me?'' Love asks him with
disdain. ''TM A BITCH/'' she
warns them all and cranks up the
music.
For more than an hour, her vulgar
allure in full bloom, Love flaunts her
superiority over the audience. Her
performance is a slur of politics and
pouty sexuality. She is scornful. Scat-
ological. Scurrilous. Every lyric she
sings--from ''I fake it so real I am be-
yond fake / Someday you will ache
like I ache'' to ''I made my bed ; T11
lie in it. / I made my bed ; T'11 die
in it''-is echoed by these kids. A fer-
vor bordering on the religious seems
to be sweeping through this more or
less Mormon congregation, and as
she douses them with bottled water--
a ritual she performs for her audiences--
'*The American

widescreen laserdisc lover. The latest
35-inch entrant is Mitsubishi's top-of-
the-line CS35803, a feature-packed
tabletop set that comes at a suggested
price of $3,199. Any 35-inch direct-
view set this costly better perform well
because, let's face it, you can get some
fine 45- to 50-inch rear-projection sets
at this price, as ''Big-Screen Brouhaha''
(Feb.), our rear-projection shootout
showed.
If it's features you're looking for,
you'll like what you find with this
Mitsubishi. For example, a common fea-
ture on sets today is channel lock. This
set takes the idea a step further with
parental lock. This allows you to lock
out either individual channels or access
to the entire TV. and only a four-digit
code will reaccess viewing. It's a fail-safe
way to prevent kids from watching too
much TV. although it may not do much
for your parental popularity rating.
There is a Super Ouick Vew function
that allows you to program in your
favorite 10 channels, then view them
instantly with the touch of a button.
The set also has picture-in-picture, but
adds a couple of twists; in particular,
snap shot and replay functions.
However, the set's most useful and
interesting feature is the long awaited
offers its own custom look to the basic
StarSight display and feature package.
The guide appears on the screen
with a touch of the remote, and is intu-
itive and easy to use. While watching a
particular channel, you can use
StarSight's browsing function to show
what programs are on other channels,
how much time remains on any of the
shows, and even what the shows are
about. Wih the Mitsubishi set, you'll
also receive a fuller description than
with the Zenith version of the StarSight
interface.

Besides playing laserdiscs, the CLD-
S104 has one of the new separate draw-
ers-within-a-drawer for five-inch music
CDs. As a combi player, it also handles
CD-ideo discs and VSDs (video sin-
gles), eight-inch LDs and 12-inch
laserdiscs.
It's a breeze to hook up. Flug it into
an outlet, and run the left and right
RCA jacks for audio out to a surround
processor, an audio/video receiver or a
monitor. A single composite video cable
connects to the video output and heads
to the video in jack on your processor,
receiver or monitor.
Operation couldn't be simpler
either. There's nothing happening on
the front panel except basic open/close
for the CD or LD drawer, plus controls
for play, fast forward, review, stop,
pause, and power. The rest of the func-
tions are on the remote, which does not
feature a jog/shuttle dial. The remote
can freeze single frames and advance
frame by frame on CAV discs only. And
it has skip, for finding the start of songs
or movie chapters, and scan, which is
digital fast forward. The scan feature,
however, leaves something to be ]
desired. Sometimes the frames jarred so ]
much I couldn't tell what I was looking ]
at. For moments such as these, there is ]
clear scan: Hit the display button and ]
then scan forward or in reverse, and the ]
machine plucks an image from every 10 [
or so frames and holds it clearly so you ]
can see where you're going.

class home theater experience and,
thanks to the inclusion of dual-purpose
left and right main channel speakers,
satisfying stereophonic performance as
well. Considering the number and qual-
ity of the individual components sup-
plied with the Synthesis ), the price of
admission does not seem unreasonable.
For your $18,900, you get a pair of S3M
cinema and music speakers for the front
left and right channels, an S3C center
channel, a pair of S2A dipole effects
speakers, and a pair of S3S 12-inch sub-
woofers. The center-channel speaker
can be configured vertically or horizon-
tally, as you choose. You also get an
SDP-1 surround-sound processor, which
is essentially a modified version of
Lexicon's CP3-plus, and S650 and S400
power amplifiers, which deliver a total
of 1,050 watts into 8 ohms, and an S3-
SPP signal processorlequalizer
We ran all this audio hardware with
our video set-up, which consisted of a
Mitsubishi VS-1250 front projector, a
Dwin LD-2 line doubler, a Da-lLite
Model C screen, a Pioneer CLD-97
laserdisc playe, and an Audio Alchemy
vl.1 digitallanalogr converter for pro-
cessing the audio bits. The set-up was
wired with Monster Cable speaker wire
and interconnects, and Straight Wire
SilverLink II video cable.
A number of the components in the
Synthesis 5 are derivations of [BL pro-
fessional theater products, which are
installed in nearly 0 percent of the
movie theaters in this country and built
to standards higher than one would
normally associate with consumer
equipment. And like real movie theater
set-ups, the Synthesis 3 utilizes horn
tweeters in the front, center and effects
speakers. The standards for home THX
certification require that treble disper-
sion be controlled only in the vertical

the components, the Synthesis }'s most
formidable strength is its ability to be

[BDs proprietary computer program and
a technician trained to calibrate the sys-
tem for each customer's specific home

level of home theater realism that set a
new standard in our reference room.
Tonal balance, from midbass to upper
treble, was refined and correct, with no
part of the frequency range calling
attention to itself. Integration between
the speakers was flawless. The transi-
tion of sonic information from one
speaker to another was accomplished
seamlessly, heightening the sense of
movie realism.
As noted, the Synthesis compo-
nents were derived from [BCs pro-THX
applications, a fact that became evident
when we pushed the system at high vol-
umes for prolonged periods. While
other high-powered components have,
under extreme conditions, compressed
the dynamic peaks of blockbuster
soundtracks, the Synthesis encom-
passed major swings in volume without
ever breaking a sweat. Watching films
that have hectic action sequences that
take place simultaneously with calmer
scenes are well served here, as the [BL
system properly delineates each
sequence while preserving the integrity
of the cinematic whole. [BCs matched

min. priced for rental. Orion.
The title of Blue Sky refers to an
Army project to measure radioactivity
from atom bomb tests, which is danger-
ous even when the weather looks fine.
The family of Hank Marshall (lones), a
major assigned to the project in the
early '60s, is in a similar state. His wife
Carly (Lange), despite two teenage
daughters, has remained an adolescent
obsessed with movie-star glamor. Her
volatile behavior threatens Hank's
career, already in jeopardy because he
won't toe the line on nuclear testing.
In his final film, director Tony
Richardson paints a detailed portrait of
a troubled family in which love is not
escape the corruption of Paris, He
arrives to find a brutish sheriff, multi-
ple murders, lewd behavior in the
streets, ignorance and intolerance
rampant, and the local priest (Holm)
making hay with the ladies. And the
local big shot (Nicol Williamson),
whose family takes dysfunctionality to
the next level, shows an unusual inter-
est in Courtois' latest case, in which
the defendant is a pig (of the four-
footed persuasion).
The Advocate, a ribald, wildly
entertaining British import, is set in
1452, when the Inquisition held sway
and animals were attributed souls-and
legal shenanigans had begun to turn
trials into major entertainment events.
Writer and director Leslie Megahey
plays this as a modern story with
medieval details, The style seems
anachronistic, but it maximizes the

while closer objects and obstacles would be
identified using words. It may be possible to
eliminate the need for guide dogs and
canes, replacing them with sonar signals and
spoken words,
To date the researchers have only created
maps for the campus where they've been
working. However, it should be possible to
use any electronic map of any geographical
location. Furthermore, the five test subjects
(Golledge and four others, only one of
whom is visually impaired) have only used a
small area of the campus. This area consists
of a network of short, straight paths inter-
sected by other paths and is generally de-
void of large obstacles and structures that
would reduce the consistency of signal ac-
quisition. The end of each path is marked
by a stationary satellite signal receiver emit-
ting virtual tones.
Returning sight to those who have lost it
may not be possible for modern science, but
through technologies such as VR people
with visual impairments may find new ways
to navigate through the world. They would
no longer need to rely on the assistance of
friends and strangers to direct them to their
destination, They would no longer have to
worry about becoming an imposition on the
world. The research being done on 3D and
textured sound, along with new ways of de-
termining a person's position in an environ-
ment, might give people with visual impair-
ments the freedom to find their own way.
RIDE THE BUS
People take a great deal for granted as they
wander through their daily lives. Take go-
ing to work, for example. Getting up and
going to work in the morning is an easy
thing for most people to do. Some drive,
others take public transportation. They all
get to where they're supposed to be easily
enough.
But what if you don't have a car and can't
figure out how to use a bus? All those buses
with all those routes and stops can be con-
fusing. It's a miracle that anyone can figure
out how to use the system.
Well, some people can't, at least not with-
out a good bit of help. There are millions of
people with mental disabilities who just
can't figure out all those buses, routes, and
stops, Trying often makes them nervous
and confused. Of course, social-service pro-
grams can help train people to use the bus
systems, but those programs are often ddiffi-
cult to find and always cost the providing
agencies a lot of money and time.
Travel training is a goal-oriented affair
usually accomplished in the following man-
ner: Students and coaches travel back and
forth over a particular bus route until the
student learns and becomes comfortable
with taking that bus. The process often in-
volves repeating the stages of bus riding (in-
cluding money exchange, seat selection,
identification of destination, and departure
points) over weeks and, perhaps, months,
However, a more cost-effective, time-effi-
cient way of conducting this training has
been developed.
Lyn Mowafy is the project director for
the University of Dayton's (Ohio) Train to
Travel Project. The project was originally
designed to help severely mentally disabled
junior and senior high-school students learn
to take public transportation. Through the
use of individual head-mounted displays
(HMDs), which provide the look and feel of a
real bus ride (including reproduction of ac-
tual scenery), the designers wanted to pro-
vide job-trained students with a new way to
learn about riding a bus,
In the past, teachers were given the task
of providing travel training to students who
required it. But teachers often felt over-
worked and undertrained for the job. This
lack of ability and resources often left stu-
dents with no way of getting from their
homes to their jobs other than the paratran-
sit services provided under Americans with
Disabilities Act. Miami Valley's Regional
Transit Authority (RTA) (Dayton), finding
this arrangement exorbitantly expensive,
approached the university and decided to
fund their Train to Travel project. Accord-
ing to Carla Lakatos, director of planning
and marketing for the transit authority, the
rationale for the RTA's decision was that if
more people could use the regular bus sys-
tem, the more expensive door-to-door ser-
vices would be left to those who really need
them.
Before students enter the virtual bus,
they are given a course in bus-riding basics
using a multimedia program on a Macintosh
among a group of scientists and researchers
searching for a scientific explanation behind
the healing effect of dolphins. In 1991, he
founded the AquaThought Foundation in
Torrance, Calif., a privately funded academic
research organization that studies the neu-
rological impact of human-dolphin interaction.
To assist in their research, Cole and his
colleagues at AquaThought developed a VR
Experience called Cyberfin, which is prob-
ably the closest thing you can get to meeting
a dolphin face to fin without getting wet.
Zole and his colleagues created Cyberfin to
simulate a dolphin encounter out of the wa-
ter, hoping to produce brain waves similar
to those that occur in humans after an actu-
al dolphin swim.
Cyberfin has quickly evoloved from a
crude research tool built in a garage to a
piece of commercial, location-based enter-
tainment. A prototype of Cyberfin (Figure 2)
made its debut at SIGGRAPH 1994 (Orlando,
Fla.), before long lines of VR enthusiasts who
waited two hours or more to experience this
virtual swim with the dolphins. If the crowd
is any indication of the system's popularity,
Cyberfin could be one of the hottest VR ex-
periences to hit the mainstream.
Cyberfin delivers all the sights, sounds,
and most important, the intense feeling of
an underwater encounter with dolphins. To
experience Cyberfin, you lie on your back
on a liquid crystal-filled mattress. Through
VR glasses, you view a 31D underwater scene
presented on a C-20 collimated monitor.
The eerie and mournful sound of dolphin
song comes over two huge speakers placed
next to your ears, The sound vibrates deep
in your bones, Suddenly, dolphins appear.
They swim playfully, darting in and out of
your view. One swims right by your face,
making eye contact. Soon, you are swim-
ming with the group around a beautiful un-
derwater reef. After a few minutes, the dol-
phins encircle you in a gesture of farewell.
When it's over you feel delighted, elated,
and a little wigged out. According to Cole,
that's exactly how you should feel. 'In reali-
ty, swimming with a dolphin can be over-
powering. It's not a casual swim. You get
out of the water and you feel different.''
The impact of an actual dolphin encoun-
ter, says Cole, lies in dolphin echolocation
energy, the powerful sonar dolphins use to
navigate in the sea. Cole theorizes that this
energy, which can be as strong as 2,000
watts, has something to do with how dol-
phins heal. ''That's enough energy to cause
changes in cellular membranes, which
would change biomolecules. You could com-
pletely rearrange a living organism using
that kind of sound.''
Cyberfin employs some unique technol-
ogy to deliver the feeling of echolocation
energy and the overall intensity of actual
dolphin encounter (Figure 3). A Vibrasonic
table produces vibra-tactile sound via huge
transducers placed underneath the mat-
tress. The transducers pump low frequency
signals directly into the soft tissues of the
body. Higher frequency audio signals, up to
150 kHz, are transduced directly onto nerve
pathways with a neurophone, a device in-
vented as a hearing aid for the deaf that
sends audio signals directly into the brain.
Cole feels that the neurophone accurately
reproduces the skin-to-water transduction
of dolphin echolocation energy.

T'he board is optimized to work
in conjunction with video applica-
tions where high-quality output
and multichannel flesibility are
important. The EX-4 also supports
the ability to handle dual-device
operations; meaning that the board
has the ability to record on any
number of channels while playing
back on the remaining channels.
All four channels are independent,
and they can perform functions
simultaneously.
Another important feature for
video applications is EX-4's ability
to sync to an external tie source.
The card's two external clock in-
puts make it capable of syncing to
any external audio or video time.
The EX-4 is EISA-compatible and
can accommodate 32-bit data

PC. Its a systemwide procedural language
with a full set of operators. It sports a
number of third-party implementations,
including Borland's ObjectVision for
OS/2, Ouercus Systems' Personal REXX
3.0 and HockWare's VisPro REXX Gold
Edition. You'll also find versions of REXX
for DOS, UNID, Mac System 7 and even
Windows-Personal REXX for Windows
from Ouercus Systems (800-440-5944,
408-867-7399).
Mac power users, meanwhile, have
AppleScript built into System 7.5. Even
the Finder can now be scripted using Ap-
pleScript. Many third-party vendors (in-
cluding Microsoft) are creating Apple-
Script-aware programs that use the
language to automate tasks.
You may wonder why I'm complain-
ing. After all, there are plenty of third-
party automation utilities available for
Windows. But Microsoft didn't take a
leadership position on what the stan-
dard Windows scripting language
should be. That's why we have a mind-
boggling number of incompatible, pro-
prietary options.
The result is that we power Windows
users are far less likely to embrace macros
and scripting than our OS/2 and Macin-
tosh brethren. Why bother to spend the
time to master some random language
that may not be available in five years?
As OS/2 and Mac power users become
increasingly familiar with REXX and Ap-
pleScript-and the languages become
more mature-end-user automation on
the Windows platform falls behind.
Windows 3.x ships with the pathetic
Macro Recorder. It's not extensible. You
can't edit the scripts, And it has a lousy
interface. Macro Recorder is a joke.

too high.
In today's competitive market, soft-
ware publishers will do almost anything
to grab a share of your mind, your hard

even give you their software hoping you'll

charge me a few dollars and teach me
how to do something.
Today, you can expect to see major
new products introduced with a special
''deal''-usually a low price. At introduc-
tion time, software publishers deeply dis-
count or give away their crown jewel to
capture you as a long-term customer.
A few months ago, a government peri-
odical announced buyers could get the

Even on the open market you can find
suites down to about $299.

fered the first version for the cost of ship-
ping and handling. Then last fune, CA,
under the name 4Home Productions, in-
troduced an updated version for an up-

The P6 seems poised to take over the
desktop and nearly all else-eventually.
9he Hexium The Sesiumf The Intel marketing folks
i do have a slight problem. Still, whatever Intel ulti-
A mately calls the P6, it's going to be fast. Expect the
initial, 133-MHz P6-which will probably appear in the
fall-to deliver roughly twice the performance of a 90-
MHz Pentium. Future P6 chips will run at clock speeds
of200 MHz and possibly greater.
Bowm te the Core The P6 will achieve its performance
gain over the Pentium partly through its decoupled,
asynchronous superscalar organization. AMD's forth-
coming K5, which should appear in an initial 100-MHz
version in the fall, uses a similar microarchitecture. No
clear winner emerges ifyou judge the P6 and K5 by their
internal organizations alone, but differences beyond the
processors' RISC-like cores will probably allow the P6 to
maintain a solid performance advantage. The P6 adds
adedicated 64-bit L2 cache interface, for example, which
allows the chip to access the secondary cache at full
processor speed.
E8C Bmsimess Unlike the K5, which AMD made pin-
compatible with the Pentium to encourage vendor accep-
tance, the P6 also implements a split-transaction exter-
nal bus,This new interface will increase bus bandwidth
considerably. Along with other P6 features such as inter-
nal parity checking and an integrated APIC interrupt
controller, the split-transaction bus prepares the P6 to
meet what is surely one of Intel's goals: the conquest of
even the high-end server market and other niche mar-
kets that more-expensive RISC systems now dominate.
Pentiasmm Sl Reigms We wouldn't recommend that
you become too attached to your Pentium system if
you haven't already, but the Pentium will still domi-
nate for some time to come. Initial P6s will undoubt-
edly find an enthusiastic market among those willing
to pay top dollar for the best performance, but over at
least the next 18 months, the Pentium will probably
offer a pricelperformance mix much better suited to
the mainstream. AMID, Cyrix, and NexGen have each
announced chips that may outperform the Pentium
at identical clock speeds, and each company promises

s a roving urban chickie, I am abundantly qualified to take CD-
fgOMUNCE, a quarterly CD-ROM singles magazine, for a spin, With
more than 500 video-enhanced personals from men and women in the L S
to choose from,I figured my pursuit of a playmate was sure to be a fun
and successful endeavor.
After a less-than-one-frame-per-second video introduction,I filled out
the rudimentary questionnaire, describing whom I was seeking: age 21 to
59; height 6 feet or taller; religious and ethnic options - blank: search
words ''ski'' and ''sail'' Then I gleefully awaited my potential mates, There
twere none. I was an unmatchable woman (proving my last boyfriend right
on that score!). Nixing the search words,I was promptly matched with
five men, Hmm. Apparently, common interests hold little sway with this
electronic matchmaker.
No matter: five eligible bachelors were lined up to meet me - all a
quick e-mail or voicemail away! First there was Adam, an interesting
creature, who provided a photo montage, audio track, and video clip of
nimself. A biomedical engineering studentguitarist big on Spyro Gyra
and classic rock, we had nothing in common but being human and Jew-
ish. Plus, he's in Chicago, making lunch dates a stretch.
Next is Bob. Bob's fave food is milkshakes. Bob is also into classic rock,
and his favorite entertainer is Cindy Crawford. Nuff said,I browsed on and
came across Bryan, who blades and likes U2 and Green Eggs and Ham.
We were getting warmer, escept that he lives in Cincinnati.
Frank, another classic-rock aficionado (apparently the keyword ''classic
rock'' would garner more fans than Toto!), was seeking a woman who
lived in Georgia.
This was silly, What's the attraction of tinny audios and jerky videos of
men located all across America? But, trooper that I am, I clicked on man

, n his best-selling book CuckoosEgg,astronomer
'and part-time computer scientitt Clifford Stoll told
ofhis pursuit and capture ofa gang of German hack-
ers, Now, hes back with a 230-page meditation on
life in cyberspace.And his report is bleak.
Silicon Snake Oilit a loose collection of anecdotes
and bon motsthat illuustrate histwin themes: too
often we mistake information for knowledge, and
cyberspace isno substitute for real-world sensation.
Stoll argues that the speed of online discussion
fostersflames rather than reasoned debate, that
mastering the constantly changing skills required to
use computers is time poorly spent, that the fancy
textand graphis possible with computer publishing
leads to afalse and dangerous sense of professional-
ism,that our lives would probably be better if we
tossed some of the newfangled contraptions,
Stoll says nothing that cultural critis such as Sven
Birkertsand Neil Postman haven't said many times
before, and more eloquently.But because Stoll
really knows computers, from the frustration of Uni
manuals to the intricacies ofTCP/IP his critidsms can
get under your skin.
You wantto tell him:''Yeah, but nextyears ver-
sion.,,,' and 'Sure, but withall the timelsave...''
But after Stollsfiftieth example of how computers
force us to master technical minutiae at the expense
of real learning, those replies seem less credible.
This book istoo relentlessly one-sided and too ram-

For a clear conscience, take these bon mots a page at a time.
Of course, it may sacrifice some emotional
power, butI sometimes imagine it may start
to gain a kind of linguistic power - universali-
ty, specificity, As it becomes ubiquitous, peo-
ple will want music purpose-designed much
more. Just as you choose to arrange things
and colors in your house in a particular way,
Ithink you will choose music like that. Imag-
ine that you order an evening of music over
the Net, You say, 'We're having a dinner, peo-
ple should be able to talk over the music, I'm
fond of Pachelbel's Canon and Joni Mitchell
and Miles Davis, Can you put together three
hours for me?'' Whereupon the brain of the
system looks through its ever-evolving ''taste-
clumps'' - the product of continuous cust-
omer research - and says, ''Someone who
likes those things is quite likely to also enjoy
some of the quieter moments of Hector Lazou,
Jane Siberry, and Jon Hassell'' It will compile
a comhination of all those, This is an autocu-
rator. You could even tell it how experimental
you wanted it to be: ''Really surprise me - pull
out a few long shots''
There is a book called Elevator Music that
calls elevator music and Muzak ''furniture
music'' - utilitarian fixtures of our environ-
ment. lt says more is going on in that kind
of music than most people think.
Yes! T'm always thrilled when someone sud-
denly says, Hey! you can take this seriously
as well, It's like a new piece of the world that
suddenly opens up for you.
So what kind of cultural margins do you
think we should be taking seriously now?
ITm trying to take videogames and video-
game music seriously. Videogame music
is not music thatlwould listen to as on a
CD, but automatically evolved video music
would be a million times better than hav-
ing to hear that idiot music that repeats
itself over and over again.The number
of hours that people listen to Mario Broth-
ers music is probably greater than the
total number of hours that people listen
to Beethoven.
That's probably true.
The total number of hours that people are
listening to game music probably exceeds
all hours spent listening to classical music,
so its very important that there be some
kind of mechanical music worth listening
to,lsee a place for machine music as some-
where between the handcrafted music sold
on albums, and pure, canned, inane, repe-
titious stuff. ldeally, what we want in a
videogame or an interactive experience is
automatic music that's adjusting in real
time to what we're doing.The music is
changing depending on what's happening
on the screen.
Automatic music becomes interesting when
it does something we didn't expect, Yet mere
'didn't expect'' isn't good enough - we have
to already have a framework of expectations
against which to be surprised. That frame-
work can be simple - such as one's sense of
wonder when the tape loops in Steve Reich's
''It's Gonna Rain'' mysteriously recombine to
produce something apparently quite different
from what they are. That's a surprise of
synergy. Another kind of surprise is that of
extension - such as when Dorothy Love
Coates collapses down to that beautiful,
heartbreaking low note in ''Lord Don't Forget
about Me,'' just when you thought she could
never go any lower. That kind of surprise is
ddifficult to get from a machine, because it
depends so much on our empathy with
another human, and on our belief that this
music represents some feeling that a human
is having or could have.
Of course, a lot of the remixing of musical
tracks - which is so fashionable now - has an
automatic music feel about it: spin a few
samples and see what they do together.
The other thing about all this remixing is,
who keeps track of the intellectual proper-
ty rights as bits of music are passed from
studio to studio?
Intellectual rights is the hottest area going,
and certainly not only in music, There are so
many uniquely new problems. For example, I
think of producing as the act of creating a
sonic and concepttual overview of the record.
And this type of creation is a whole new cate-
gory for which there is no current copyright
arrangement. When you're using sophisticat-
ed tools with very strong personalities, is the
designer of the tools in some sense responsi-
ble for what finally comes out? Should that
designer benefit? When a new tool or tech-
nology comes into existence, and suddenly 50
people at the same time see the same obvious
idea, is it right that the one who gets to the
publisher or patent office first should get all
the material benefits of that idea? If not, how
else do we share it?
m impressed with Bruce Sterling, the sci-
ence fiction writer. Hes loaded much of his
nonfiction writing onto the Net. He says, in
effect,This is copyrighted, but you can
make a copy of it for noncommercial rea-
sons; go ahead, he says, spread it around.
He calls it Literary Freeware. He encourages
people to make a copy of a book of his that
is still in print.
ITve always thought one of the most fantastic
things about the Grateful Dead was that
instead of sending heavies down into the
crowd to smash people over the head and
take their cassette recorders, they offered
them a nice board to plug into so at least they
got a decent recording.
l'm curious about the economic motives of
artists in these technological times. At the
first hearing, ambient music sounds like
music that was made because it could be
made.When you were first making ambient
music, did you expect anybody to buy it!
Yes! As with everything I do,I expected it to
be tremendously successful. [Laughs.]
What led you to believe anybody else
wanted to listen to that kind of music, as it
was so mechanical and not fashionable
'll tell you what it was, It was based on an
observation that my tastes aren't that different
from other people's, I always know that ifI
like something now, enough other people are
going to like it soon enough. For instance,
when I got into female body builders, every
guy Iknew was saying, Oh god! Its gross!I
said, Oh yeah, this is just the last wall of resis-
tance before they finally admit that they think
these women are enormously sexy, Sure
enough, they do now.I just admit to my tastes
sooner.I don't have any embarrassment about
what I like. It doesn't threaten what I've liked
before even when it appears completely
inconsistent with it,I don't mind the tension,
and I don't think I haye to compromise my
whole theory of life to accept this thing. If Im
attracted to something, I immediately surren-
der to it,I offer no resistance to being
seduced. Because I offer no resistance,I think
thatI sometimes touch things more quickly
than other people do, s s
Paine
4 213 COnservative in order not to lose favor
with society, Paine did neither and fell from
grace. Many of his reform programs will
remain unacceptable to political conserva-
tives and his religious views will always
offend believing Christians. Though his
memory is invoked from time to time, his
resurrection will never be complete.
At the moment, though, he is showing
signs of minor resurgence. In 1994, officials
in Washington, DC, were considering funding
a monument to him somewhere. And Sir
Richard Attenborough, the famed British
actor and director, has been struggling for
several years to get studio backing for a film
about Paine.
A Paine bio - featuring two bloody revolu-
tions, standoffs with Napoleon, tangles with
the British royals, and cameo roles for Wash-
ington, Jefferson, Robespierre, and his neme-
sis George III - would make a socko TV
miniseries, too.
Nigel Hawthorne could play Paine's father,
who intercepted his runaway teenage son in
1756 as he was about to board the Terrible, a
privateer captained by a man named William
Death. Heeding his father's desperate plea,
Paine didn't sail, Shortly afterward, the TErri-
ble was engaged by a French privateer, the
Iengeance, and was horribly mauled. More
than 150 members of its crew were killed,
including Captain Death and all but one of
his officers,
Anthony Hopkins could star in Rights of
3Ian, playing the role of the Honourable
Spencer Perceval, who stood up at the Guild-
hall in London to read out the sedition
charges against the absent Paine in 1792 and
accuse him of being ''wicked, malicious, and
ill-disposed''
And imagine the scene of his near-execu-
tion, Paine went to France after the Revolu-
tionary War as a hero and supporter of
democratization there. But the French Revo-
lution was far bloodier and more violent than
the American, Paine tried to save King Louis
NVI's life and pleaded with the country's new
rulers to be merciful and democratic. Eventtu-
ally, he was imprisoned and sentenced to
death. In June 1794, sis months into his har-
rowing imprisonment, watching as hundreds
of fellow prisoners were led off to be killed,
Paine fell into a feverish semiconsciousness,
His fellow cellmates barely kept him alive,
mopping his brow, feeding him soup, and
changing his clothes.
The prison governors were ordered to send
him to the guillotine the next morning, At 6
a.m., a turnkey carrying Paine's death war-
rant walked quietly down the prison corri-
dors, chalking the cell doors of the con-
demned, marking the number k on the inside
of Paine's door. Usually the turnkey marked
the outside of the door, but Paine was seri-
ously ill, and his cellmates had been granted
permission to leaye the door open so that a
breeze could help cool Paine's profusely
sweating body.
That evening, the weather cooled, and
Paine's cellmates asked a different turnkey
for permission to close the door, Knowing
that the number on the door was now
inward, the occupants of the cell waited,
Paine murmuring on his cot, Near midnight,
the death squad slowly made its way down
the corridor, keys jangling, pistols drawn.
One of his friends cupped his hand over
Paine's mouth. The squad paused, then
moved on to the next cell,
A few days later, the Jacobin government
was overthrown, A fellow prisoner said Paine
had struggled to keep his democratic values
alive in prison, ''He was the confidant of the
unhappy, the counselor of the perplexed; and
to his sympathizing fiiendship many a devot-
ed victim in the hour of death confided the
last cares of humanity; and the last wishes of
tenderness'
Despite his close call, Paine stayed in
France until 1802 when he managed, inevit-
ably, to alienate Napoleon, At the invitation of
Jefferson, he returned to the United States to
a hostile welcome.
Although he had left the United States a
revolutionary hero, Paine soon outraged the
American clergy by publishing The lge of
Heason, He infuriated the business communi-
ty with his pro-labor writings in England and
by publishing lgrarian Justice. He also wan-
dered into the middle of increasingly vicious
domestic politics, Federalists, looking for
ground to attack Jefferson, seized tupon his
invitation to Paine to come home, Paine was
savaged as a heretic, and as an unwashed,
drunken infidel. He was attacked in columns
and stories, insulted on the streets and in
public places, Not only had the children for-
gotten the father, they had turned on him.
Paine didn't see, writes eane, ''that he was
among the first modern public figures to
suffer firsthand an increasingly concentrated
press equipped with the power to peddle one-
sided interpretations of the world''
Perhaps, if a movie is made and Paine
becomes a focus of attention once more,
somebody could locate his bones, That they
are missitng may be the most fitting postscript
to his life. British journalist and Paine con-
temporary William Cobbett smarted at the
way Paine had been neglected in his final
years, Cobbett wrote, in his Cobbetts IIeekly
Political Iegistet, under the pseudonym of
Peter Porcupine: ''Paine lies in a little hole
uunder the grass and weeds of an obscure
farm in America, Thhere, however, he shall
not lie, unnoticed, much longer. He belongs
to England''
Just before dawn one autumn night in
1819, Cobbett, his son, and a friend went tu
Paine's New Rochelle farm - the hole under
the grass is still there, marked by a plaque

indicator turns negative if traders are betting on a stock surge--which they
have been lately, after being noncommittal for three months.
Advance/ Decllne Line (32) A moving average of the differ-

market moves are broadly or narrowly based. Computed by InvesTech, the
measure recently bounced back to provide support for the Dow's run-up.
Advlsory Sentlment (6/6) Investment advisors tend to be fol-

fretted last month as their optimism waxed ever stronger, but the good
feeling seems to have plateaued. Compiled by Investors Intelligence.
Commodlty index (34) Supplied by Goldman, Sachs, this mea-

driven by increases in energy and precious metals. The index now shows a
net rise of 1.5 percent for 1995 to date, boding ill for inflation.
Consumer and Corporate Debt (5/5) This aggregate mea-

leagues. Wakeman spends three to four
hours a day talking to other fund managers.
He regularly badgers Price's 26 research an-
alysts for ideas. His old department, he says,
is nothing less than a ''gold mine.''
Gold mines do have their risks. The de-
partment recently directed him toward, and
then steered him away from, a catastrophic
stock pick: Exide Corp., a Michigan com-
pany founded by Thomas Edison that makes
and sells batteries for cars and boats world-
wide. The stock had been a Wall Street fa-
vorite since going public in late 1993, and it
shot from $20 per share to $56 by year-end
1994. Near the end of January 1995, when
the stock dipped to $48, an analyst brought
the stock to Wakeman's attention and sug-
gested he take a look. Wakeman started re-
searching it. But another analyst, William
Stromberg, talked Wakeman out of the
stock in early March. Stromberg warned
that the company could have earnings prob-
lems because of the warm weather being ex-
perienced throughout the Northeast.
Stromberg was right: North America had
the second warmest winter on record, and
Europe experienced its warmest winter in
400 years. Batteries weren't dying, cus-
tomers weren't buying, and Exide's earnings
fell below expectations. ''Now it could lose
a lot of money, and I may buy it when it
settles in the $30 range,'' Wakeman says.
Wakeman's best pick so far has been
Adobe Systems, a Silicon Valley graphics
software company that he bought at $30 in
December. ''The stock looked cheap to us,''
Dayton Hudson. In early January, Wake-
man invested $850,000 in the company.
''But Christmas was bad,'' he says, shaking
his head. ''And the first quarter went soft
again because consumer spending was
down.'' By mid-March, Dayton Hudson
had fallen off its perch in the low 80s to set-
tle in the high 60s.
It was a crucible for Wakeman; he liter-
ally wrings his hands as he describes it. ''I
thought at first, managing a fund is going to
be great when it's working well,'' he says.
''But when the big stocks blow up, how will
I deal with it? Managing a new fund sounds
really neat on paper, but once I get in the
real world, how am I going to do?''
He won't, he hopes, give in to what he
knows is his biggest flaw as an investor. ''I
tend to overanalyze,'' he says. ''Fund man-
agers, like everyone else, now face informa-
tion overload, and analysis can lead to
paralysis. Sometimes I sit here and look at
information about a stock and don't move
on it.'' Last December, for example, Wake-
man missed out on the Apollo Group, an
online education and testing service that was
trading at $12. Since he wanted more in-
formation on it, he never got around to
buying it. ''It went to $25 in my face with-
in three months,'' he recalls with a grimace.
''Good move, John.''

around 8 P.M. after a last round of debates
with his fellow fund managers. Then he
works a couple hours more. ''We're not

lacked was $150,000 in Silicon Graphics
workstations, Wavefiront computer-graphics
software, international connections, and a
nice office. We supplied all that in return for
a controlling interest in the business, which
was renamed Media Arts.
When friends ask me what ''computer
graphics'' really are, I explain it this way.
You know that winged horse at the start of
all Tri-Star motion pictures? It's not a real
horse. Not that we did that particular horse,
or have done anything at all just yet for Tri-
Star. But our equipment is in use virtually
24 hours a day.
And we've started a media-monitoring
business. At an office a few miles away, we
have a bank of TVs and VCRs and a crew
employed to tape everything that plays on
R.ussian TV, keeping a log of what com-
mercials are played when. That way, adver-
tisers can verify they got the ad time they
paid for---and get a clear idea of what their
competitors are doing.
My role in this is as wire clerk. And al-
though the novelty is beginning to wear off,
it's heady stuff. Picture it. To get the Wave-
front software to our new office in Moscow,
I wired dollars from our account in Miami
to the Taipei account of the Dutch compa-
ny that represents Wavefront in R.ussia. It
then delivered the software in Moscow and
(presumably) forwarded payment to Wave-
front in California. Ah, brave new world.
Meanwhile, some of our business comes
direct to the States (1-800-MEDIAR.T-I
kid you not), so again I get to play wire
clerk. In February, the bank called to tell me
that a $450,000 wire had just come in from
France. This was to pay for commercial time
on R.ussian TV, so a few days later my part-
ners E-mailed me instructions on wiring
most of it back out: $235,000 to an account
in Moscow and $201,000 to an account in
Latvia. (Latvial)
I dutifally fired off the wire instructions,
and the bank dutifully fired off the wires.
Normally, that would have been the end
of it, but later that day I got a call from Ilya
in Moscow. ''Have the wires gone out''
he asked.
''I think so---why?''
''Can you stop them?'' he asked.
''I don't know-I doubt it,'' I said, grow-
ing ever so slightly nervous. ''Wky?''
Ilya reported that the aforementioned
ighly popular 38-year-old TV czar,
Vladimir Listyev, had just been assassinated.
Chaos reigned. Ilya thought it would be a
good idea to stop the wires.
It was seven minutes to five in Miami
(nearly one A.M. in Moscow), so I hung
up and called the bank. ''Well, it's not 100
percent guaranteed,'' I was told, ''but we
can recall the wires in the morning and
chances are the money will come back.''
So I asked them to do that--all of this
confirmed in writing, of course-apologiz-
ing for the inconvenience. ''The irony,'' I
said, ''is that things are likely to settle back
down in a day or two and we'll have to send
the darn wires out all over again. But better
safe than sorry.''
Sure enough, a day or two later, that's just
what happened. I received word from my
partners that it was okay to send the money.
The $235,000 from Moscow had already
come back, so I instructed the bank to send
it back out. ''And if the $201,000 comes
back from Latvia, send it back out, too.''
Twelve days passed. I was out of town,
thinking about other things, but then came
an E-mail from Moscow. Where's the
$235,000?
I called my counterpart at the bank.
''Oh,'' she said. ''I was going to call you this
morning.''
''Yeah?''
It seems that instead of resending the
$235,000 that had come back from
Moscow, she had accidentally resent a sec-
ond $201,000 to Latvia.
I won't take you through every twist and
turn. Suffice it to say that Latvia is not Cleve-
land. The Latvians apparently thought this
second $201,000 was a miracle. An answered
prayer. Can you imagine how much money
$201,000 is in Latvia? When the Latvians
were apprised of the error and asked to return
the money, they said, ''No,'' The Latvian
bank was contacted directly by a vice presi-
dent of the Miami bank. ''Forget it,'' he was
told. ''You're not getting the money back.''
This made the Miami bank, which ac-
knowledged it was their problem not ours
(but which showed a $170,000 overdraft in
our account all the same), highly nervous.
The FBI was contacted; Kroll Associates, a
private investigative firm, was poised to
strike. At the 1lth hour, our partners in
Moscow prevailed on their partners' part-
ners in Latvia to force the bank to return
the money. Something like that. All I know
is that the money came back.
And now a nice wire has come in from
Hong Kong, trom a client who wants to sell
TVs in R.ussia.
