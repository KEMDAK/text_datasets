Winning the Washington State Lottery's Scratch
game is one of the nicer things that can happen in
life, as opposed to some of the little things that
always seem to go wrong. That's the positioning of a 
wacky new TV campaign for the Lottery from McCann-
Erickson, Seattle. One spot takes place at a restaurant,
where a woman is telling her companion that she thinks 
their first date is going really well. Her shy suitor smiles
broadly, revealing a huge piece of spinach stuck to his
teeth. In another spot, a customer in a seafood restau-
rant confronts two restroom doors, labeled "Starfish"
and "Sand Dollars." He chooses the "Starfish" door, only
to be greeted by a woman's scream. Each "losing" situa-
tion ends with a cut to a lottery ticket as an announcer 
explains, "You win some, you lose some. But with a Lot-


Sports Channel Pacific: WHAT STRIKE?


With a tip of the beret to the bohemian roots of San
Francisco's East Bay, Wolfe/Doyle uses a carica-
ture of a beat poet to promote the broadcast of the 
Oakland A's baseball games on SportsChannel. Three 
black-and-white shots show the poet on a smoky stage as
she lyrically rants about her favorite team. Blue highlights
and sultry jazz exaggerate the juxtaposition of all-Amer-
ican sport and midnight beatnik scene. W/D's spots for the 
San Francisco Giants' games, on the other hand, take a
different tack. Those spots feature a wisecracking peanut
vendor who shares the tricks of the trade as he strolls up
and down the sunny stands. Both characters were creat-
ed before the teams knew when the strike would be set-
tled. Instead of taking an apologetic stance to woo sports

 
identity. The two networks struck a deal to operate
independently in their core regions while arranging 
for help from their partner outside their native turf.
The joint venture created to do this, Publicis/FCB,
was 51% controlled by Publicis chairman Maurice
Levy and 49% by FCB chairman Bruce Mason.
  The pact should have given FCB the ability to find
better European representation for its giant multina-
tional clients like Levi's, R.J. Reynolds and Nabisco. 
Similarly, Publicis should have found assistance in 
introducing its European-based accounts, which
include L'Or~~al, Cosmair and Philips, into the U.S.
But there were several basic flaws in the agreement.
First, FCB had no way of commanding the Publicis
network to provide quality service to its clients. Over
time, FCB clients such as Levi's decided instead to 
work with a host of non-Publicis agencies, including
Bartle Bogle Hegarty in Britain and McCann-Erick-
son offices in parts of Europe, Latin America and
Asia. Meanwhile, the two parties cheated a bit. Levy
made no secret that he wanted his own U.S. network,
while Mason continued to explore ways of starting a 
second, FCB-run network in the U.S.


  Levy's opportunity to expand in the U.S. came two
years ago, when the financial floor under France's 
Groupe FCA collapsed. Levy moved in to rescue it
and, in the process, acquired FCA's $100-million U.S.
subsidiary, Bloom FCA!. Mason considered that com-
petition without consultation and, according to SEC
filings, a violation of his master agreement with Levy.
Their differences perked along out of earshot for a 
time, until Mason decided, apparently unilaterally, to 
establish a new holding company, True North Com-
munications, to oversee Foote Cone. The restructur-
ing, done at the end of last year, signaled his readi-
ness to expand on his own around the world.
  In February, Publicis expressed its outrage in fil-
ings with the French Stock Exchange that called for
the dissolution, through arbitration, of the
Publicis/FCB agreement. A few days later, True North
countered in similar fashion. These exchanges hit a low


  Americans close to the situation take a caustic view
of it. The fight, says one observer, "is not about money.
It's about ego and wounded French pride." Mason
feels Levy never accepted the fact that FCB has a 
legal right to act as a governor on Publicis' expansion
in the U.S.-~and should have been allowed to force
Levy to shed Bloom FCA! when Levy purchased 
Groupe FCA. Levy, no doubt, feels Mason has been
similarly unyielding in not helping him get American
and Asian representation for his European clients.
  Agency mergers have proven sticky enough to do
when the cultures are only as different as New York 
and Chicago (see Doyle Dane Bernbach and Needham
Harper). When they cross international borders, 
without a clear acquirer and acquiree, they get even
murkier. Publicis/FCB was an interesting experi-

agency holding companies. "Companies 
should have strong earnings growth, 
clean balance sheets and a record of 
stock repurchase. Investors like consis-
tency in all of that."
INDUSTRY OUTLOOK: "Good. The U.S. recov-
ery is coming on very strong. Syndica-
tion dollars going into the fall upfront 
look strong, and the recovery in
Europe has picked up steam."
INDUSTRY FAVORITES: "Omnicom has had 
consistent earnings growth and out-
standing new business growth from 
companies like Mars, Anheuser-Busch
and Digital. The company is still selling
at a discount." Also likes Heritage
Media: "The in-store business contin-
ues to grow and Heritage has had 
great success with in-store coupon

in radio duopoly."
COMMENTS: Smart new kid on the block.
Has quickly established himself. (He
was rated II's No. 2 agency analyst last


year.) Agency execs gush over his 
constant attention and enthusiasm 
for their business. Approaches job 
much like a beat reporter, consistent-
ly checking in with agency contacts
and requesting explanation of press 
releases, news events. Has added 
newsy features to GS research like
an "accounts in review" section and
detailed quarterly tracking of new
business. Observations about foreign
trends well regarded. In March, he
hosted Goldman Sachs' first adver-
tising agency seminar; all the major
U.S. and European agency and
media holding companies made 
presentations.


BEGAN COVERING INDUSTRY: 1987
FOLLOWS: IPG, WPP, Cordiant, True 
North, Omnicom; specialty publishers
like Scholastic and Readers Digest.
Follows media service companies such
as Dimac, Advo, Dimarc and CUC
International.
STRATEGY: "We view them as content
plays in the multimedia future.
Advertising is the means to subsidize
multimedia vehicles."
INDUSTRY OUTLOOK: "Macro conditions in
the U.S. have been good, and this year
there's a pickup from multinational
companies spending in Europe. Next
year you'll have a boost from the 
Olympics and political spending. So
we'll have two years of healthy growth
after two difficult years. Coming off
the leaner, meaner recession, any 
add-on spending should fall to the 
bottom line."
INDUSTRY FAVORITES: "Through its various
new partnerships, IPG is preparing for


a multimedia future without risking a
lot of financial exposure. WPP has 
instituted reorganizations within its
networks to create groups devoted to
new media. Omnicom is a very good 
play for other, less media, future-of-
advertising reasons. Omnicom has
expanded its network holdings through
Diversified Agency Services and
through new business wins." Also likes 
CUC, which is expanding its market by 
selling membership data to new media.
COMMENTS: Unusual in her media-centric 
approach to agency coverage (which 
causes some agency execs to find her
too negative in her appraisals). "A lot of
agency people say people are going to 
pay for interactive, Internet services 
with advertising on it. They said the
same thing with cable, too, when that
was new. The agencies who will thrive
in the years ahead are the ones who 
will be first to carve out a position in 
the interactive media world." ~

The Well-Dressed Car


the bone-weary, decimated 7th Division 
paused for a breather. We had come to 
Okinawa directly from five months of
combat on Leyte in the Philippines. Now
whatever was left of the Japanese army,
whatever ground had to be taken, was 
between us and the southern tip of the 
island, which we could almost see. The 
north end of Mabuni Hill, hill 89 (ele-
vation eighty-nine feet), shaped like a 
short loaf of French bread, was in the 
way, about a half-mile across a field.

Our small Counter Intel-
ligence Corps (CIC) de-
tachment included Miles
Matsumoto, a Hawaiian-
born Nisei who had been a student at
the Tokyo Technical Institute when he 
caught the last boat to Honolulu be-
fore Pearl Harbor. He was a great in-
terpreter and translator, the very best.
If he had missed that boat, he would
have been drafted into the Japanese 
army. From interrogations of prison-
ers, Miles learned that General Ushiji-
ma, in command of the Japanese 32d
Army, his chief of staff, General Cho, 
and the entire general staff were in a 
cave on the south end of Mabuni.
  It is no longer clear to me how it
came about that three of us in the CIC
detachment-~Bill Attwood from New 
York City, Miles, and I-~would cross 
the field to Mabuni, work along its ridge
to the south end, find the cave, and cap-
ture the command of the Japanese 32d
Army. Or so we thought. It was our 
idea; nobody told us to do it. Like every-
thing else throughout the campaign, 
we just did it. But for something like
that we must have spoken to the G-2,
and he probably said, without thinking
it through any more than we had, "Go
ahead if you think you can do it."
  Early the next morning, June 21, the
three of us plus two Okinawan boetai
(work battalion) who knew the way
and a chui set off across the field. We
had captured the chui, a first lieutenant
in Japanese intelligence, early in the 
campaign. Chui is Japanese for "first
lieutenant." An intelligent man with
a commanding presence, he was not
eager to die for the emperor. He quick-
ly discovered that prisoners were well


treated, given medical attention, food, 
and clothes. He knew defeat was in-
evitable, so he made it his mission,
working with our detachment, to save
as many of his countrymen as he could
by persuading them to surrender. He
saved many and no doubt some GIs
in the bargain. He was frustrated and
angry whenever he failed.
  We made it easily to the near end of
Mabuni behind a bulldozer, its blade
raised as a kind of shield since we were
easy targets in an open field. The bull-
dozer operator waved good-bye, wished 
us luck, and rumbled away quickly.
We followed a trail up the hill onto a 
wooded ridge, then along it silently, 
cautiously, Indian file, stopping fre-
quently to listen for human sounds.


Nothing. The Okinawans and the chui
were unarmed. Bill, Miles, and I car-
ried our carbines in a ready position. 
Ready for what? We were more than
halfway to the end.
  Suddenly, twenty yards ahead, a shell
burst, then another, and another-~fire
from a knee mortar, a lightweight, very
short-range Japanese infantry weapon.
They were right there! How many? In-
stinct said run, and we didn't argue. As
we took off, another round burst close 
enough to flatten Bill, Miles, and me; the
chui and the Okinawans ahead of us 
kept running. Bill was stunned momen-
tarily when his helmeted head hit a rock,
but luckily there was no real injury, only
a few mortar fragments I caught in the 
neck. We made it to the trail, scram-
bled down, and hustled across the field
to safety. The medics picked some met-
al out of my neck and patched me up.
  The next morning we tried again (the


Okinawans extremely reluctant, but they
had no choice) behind the bulldozer, 
up the trail, then very slowly along 
the ridge. No fire. We pushed farther.
No fire. No sound. Then, all the way 
to the end, where a knob of rock thrust
upward, the highest point on Mabu-
ni. The Okinawans led us cautiously
around the knob and down onto a
ledge, where they stopped. They were 
very frightened. They pointed to the 
back side of the knob, and there it was,
the cave, just as they had said. They 
wanted to leave.
  The cave opening (Okinawa is cov-
ered with caves, some wandering un-
derground endlessly) was less than three
feet wide, not as tall as a man. We were
very quiet, barely whispering. There was
no sign of any Japanese, no sound. A 
crude wooden door was propped against
the entrance. 
  We worked as close as we could get
while trying to hold some cover, and
the chui called into the cave. No reply.
He tried again, and again, each time 
something different. Silence. We assumed
the wooden door was booby-trapped, 
so we tried dropping rocks onto it 
from above, hoping to knock it over
or set off the trap. Nothing happened.
We were getting a little bolder. We 
found a long, heavy electrical wire,
which I tossed at the door, hoping to
lasso a corner. It finally caught secure-
ly enough for me to pull it over while
keeping myself more or less defiladed
behind a rock. No booby trap.
  We inched toward the entrance and
ducked our heads to walk in. We could
see some twenty-five feet or so to the
first bend. We had no lights, but we 
needed none to understand the incred-
ible, gruesome scene at our feet. The 
entire general staff in dress uniform,
one behind the other, all facing the 
same way, had committed hara-kiri,
and very recently. Generals Ushijima and
Cho were not among them. We were 
stunned, overwhelmed. After one glance
the Okinawans took off. The chui, shak-
ing with emotion, was completely silent
and remained so for a very long time.
We had almost nothing to say to one
another. What was there to say? It was
not believable. We had found the cave


a pair of air tickets.
  I had saved some money and had 
vacation time coming. I felt this might
be my last opportunity, as I feared my 
time left on earth was limited. My wife
had never flown, and I had never flown
in a jet.
  We disembarked from the Ameri-
can Airlines plane in D~~~sseldorf, Ger-
many, after making a stop in Frank-
furt, less than nine hours after leav-
ing Chicago. My first flight across the
Atlantic, to England, had taken thir-
teen hours in a new B-17.
  Never in my wildest dreams could
I have seen myself returning after for-
ty-four years to see and talk to the
people of Germany. What a contrast


with the first time!
  After we left the plane, we heard
over the loudspeaker, in English, "Mr.
and Mrs. Frank Clark, you have a 
driver waiting for you at the main 
entrance." We had wondered all across
the Atlantic how we were going to
get to Remscheid by ourselves.
  At the entrance a young man took
our luggage and led us to a big black
Mercedes limousine. Amazed, we 
climbed in, and we were off on the 
autobahn at well over one hundred


miles per hour. When we arrived in
Remscheid, our driver took us to the
best hotel in town, where we were 
shown to a beautiful room on the fifth
floor overlooking the city.
  We had not been there five min-
utes when Richard Bremicker burst 
into the room. Though he and I had
only corresponded, we embraced as if
we had known each other all our lives.
  After a short visit he told us that 
his driver would pick us up at noon.
We visited his beautiful home and then
his factory, where seventeen hundred
employees were manufacturing parts, 
mostly door hinges, for the automo-
tive industry all over the world.
  When our host learned that I was 


interested in meeting with some of the
people in other towns who had writ-
ten me letters, he put his interpreter
at our disposal, and we were able to 
reach several of them.
  During one conversation I men-
tioned feeling particularly bad about
having bombed the college town of
Paderborn, a city with no military tar-
gets. Bremicker said Paderborn was 
too far to drive, and without miss-
ing a beat, he hired a helicopter to
fly us there. Bremicker and his wife,

and research and to produce officers for interrogation.
  As we began the search for documents, we met prob-
lems: the papers had been "burned in air raids" or "de-
stroyed by ill-advised people" and so on. Interrogations
were also hard going at the start. We thought it natural 
to begin at the beginning: "Where were you when the 
war began?" But this went slowly, perhaps because of fear
of war crimes problems or just because of the unprece-
dented nature of the exercise. But we found that when
we began at the middle or end of the war and got peo-
ple engaged, it was easy to work backward. In the end
we recorded 118 interrogations, an extremely valuable 
body of material on the entire course of the Pacific war.
  Interrogations, of course, brought up the language barrier,


astating air attacks; the loss of the Philippines had cut off
access to the Southern Resources Area for which the coun-
try had gone to war. By the summer of 1944, if not earlier,
Japan was in bad straits. The armed forces ran short of 
both fuel and pilots; the food supply began to pinch; the
few automobiles that remained on the streets were run-
ning off charcoal. With surrender there had been some 
concern that the occupation forces would attempt to live 
off the land, but in a mixture of wise policy and impressive 
logistics all our food came with us.
  So also did tobacco. This was the cigarette-smoking age,
and a batch of naval officers, American and Japanese,
could produce a sizable quantity of butts in a day. When the
Meiji Building janitor appeared at the end of the after-


  But not everyone in Tokyo could benefit from the sooth-
ing effects of American nicotine. Given the strains of a 
long and lost war and the destruction inflicted by the 
bombing campaign-~deaths in the great March 9, 1945, fire
raid on Tokyo had exceeded those of either of the atomic
bombs-~one might have expected some demonstrations
of hostility. In fact none developed, and our contacts with
individual Japanese, whether naval officers or waitresses,
were orderly, correct, and even, as time went by, friendly.
  Early on, before our interrogation schedule got into full
swing, some of us toured the city. Although I am tall and 
my uniform made me even more conspicuous, so that I felt 
at the start a little like Gulliver among the Lilliputians, I got
no stares or double-takes anywhere. Except that pedes-
trian traffic seemed a little sparse and auto traffic sparser
-~understandable enough with half the urban area burned 
flat, 120,000 killed and wounded, and 1,000,000 homeless
-~the central city seemed in many respects to have returned 
to normal. Out walking one afternoon, I happened upon an
outdoor symphony concert being given in the tidied-up
shell of a bombed-out building. The orchestra members
were all in black tie, the conductor was an Austrian, the
music was Dvo~~~~k's New World Symphony. Was there a 
message here? Only the environment seemed out of place,

sue. In discussing the trend away from
the Complex Instruction Set Computer 
(CISC) to the Reduced Instruction Set
Computer and, perhaps, eventually to
the Very Long Instruction Word com-
puter, he mentions IBM's choice of 
CISC architecture with System/360 in 
the 1960s.
  Although the first 360 systems were 
not shipped until the early 1960s, plan-
ning for the 360 began in the mid-
1950s. The result had as much to do
with political warfare between three
engineering groups (two in Pough-
keepsie and one in Endicott, New 
York) as with technology. Many man-
hours were spent on trivialities, such
as an extended internal debate over bi-
nary versus decimal versus alphanu-
meric organization. None of IBM's top
management was comfortable with ar-
bitrating these kinds of decisions. By
tradition, all of them had come up
through IBM's sales organization. 
None had computer experience or an
educational background conducive to
asking the right questions.
  At that time, IBM's first high-level 
language, FORTRAN, was still in devel-
opment, and even those who under-
stood it were skeptical that it would
ever be viable. "Packaged" application
programs were not even visualized.
Memory was precious and slow. High-
speed, intelligent "cache" memory did
not exist. It was "obvious" that any
new computing system should be bina-
ry, decimal and alphanumeric; make 
maximum use of each memory cycle;
and be designed for non-technical peo-
ple who had to program commercial 
applications in assembly language.
  The 360 architecture was to become a 
serious constraint on future IBM sys-
tems. Its computational deficiencies led
to the sale of Control Data's 6600 in ma-
jor scientific centers and to IBM's even-
tual decline in the "scientific" market.
In hindsight, the 360 should have been
more RISC-like-~but more importantly,
it should have been designed for the 
programmers who write compilers.

Expanding the Contract

To the Editors:

In the March-April issue, Kumar Patel
has proposed "A Research Contract With
America" as a kind of code of ethics to be
followed by all "moral" researchers.


  The serious problem is that his fourth 
article of faith is based on an unques-
tionable reliance on a peer-review sys-
tem. As was recently emphasized by
many reputable scholars, peer review in
its present (anonymous) form is prone
to all sorts of abuses and conflicts of in-
terest. This largely stems from the utter
inequality between the grant applicant
and his/her secret "judges" (peer re-
viewers). By its very definition, peer re-
viewers are active researchers in the 
same area and, consequently, with all
the good will on earth, cannot be free
from up-front conflicts of interest. In 
any judicial system we will not tolerate 
(at least in democracies) anonymous 
judges or anonymous witnesses. And 
yet we uncritically swallow this practice
in supporting an anonymous peer-re-
view system in science.
  Abuses of anonymous peer review
are too numerous to be discounted as 
"insignificant exceptions." The whole
system calls for an urgent reform to-
wards more openness, accountability
and democracy of the entire peer-eval-
uation process. Unless and until the 
anonymity of a peer-review system is 
abolished, its inclusion as a part of the 
research code of ethics has an itself 
highly questionable grounds. Without 
this fundamental qualification, Dr. Pa-
tel's proposal is ethically flawed. It is 
imperative that the proposed code be
amended with an explicit provision of
public accountability of the peer-re-
view process itself.

To the Editors:

In response to Kumar Patel's excellent 
editorial, "A Research Contract With 
America," it may be said that a con-
tract is an obligation of both parties
based on a common understanding.
The basic research enterprise contract
with American was based on national 
survival during World War II and the 
Cold War, and both are over.
  During much of this century scien-
tists, professors, teachers and doctors
were perceived as members of commu-
nities working for the benefit of 
mankind. Today, scientists, professors, 
teachers and doctors are not accorded
by the public special respect as profes-
sionals. They are viewed by many peo-
ple as members of commercially minded 
interest groups representing corporate
interests, or as self-serving individuals.
OF VIRUSES AND MOOD DISORDERS


from the time suggest the Jewish population to
have been between 10,000 and 100,000 when the 
first person acquired the mutation.
  When Risch and his colleagues calculated the
present-day frequency of the mutation, they 
were shocked to find that the frequency of
Ashkenazi Jewish carriers of this deleterious 
mutation has increased by as much as 100-fold.
The scientists estimate that anywhere between 
one in 1,000 and one in 3,000 Ashkenazi Jews 
now carry the mutation.
  How could the number of carriers have
expanded so dramatically? Risch and his col-
leagues also found that at the time of the original
mutation, the birth and survival rates for 
Ashkenazi Jews was higher for affluent than for
lower-class families. They propose that these 
affluent families produced more surviving chil-
dren than did lower-class families. Any mutations


There may be yet another way to get de-
pressed. Faulty neurochemistry and psychic
trauma notwithstanding, it looks as though
a virus known to infect domestic animals may
also play a role in the depressive illnesses of some
psychiatric patients. In the March issue of Nature
Medicine, Liv Bode of the Robert Koch Institute in
Berlin and her colleagues report the detection of 
genetic material from the Borna disease virus in
cells from a small group of patients who were hos-
pitalized for chronic or acute depression.
  The report is a follow-up to previous studies
by German scientists that had shown that about 
10 to 15 percent of neuropsychiatric patients had
antibodies to the Borna disease virus in their 
blood, whereas only about two percent of a nor-
mal control population had the antibodies. Re-
markably, in these studies nearly 30 percent of 
those who were hospitalized for acute episodes
of major depression had the Borna antibodies.
  The presence of Borna virus antibodies in a pa-
tient's blood is not definitive proof that he or she 
has been infected with the virus. With the discov-
ery of Borna viral nucleic acids in four of six psy-
chiatric patients, however, Bode and her col-
leagues provide further support for the notion that
either the animal virus (or a related human viral
strain) is indeed an infectious agent in people.
  If so, the virus may be the cause of the pa-
tients' psychiatric illness. Some other observa-
tions by Bode and her colleagues suggest that 
this may be the case. In particular, the depres-
sive episodes in two acutely depressed patients
were associated with the presence of antibodies
to the Borna virus and Borna viral nucleic acids
in monocytes from the patients' blood. The de-
pressive symptoms of both patients decreased 
with the decline of viral activity in their blood.
  These observations are striking in the light of 
the virus's effects on animal hosts. Sporadic be-


arising in this population, therefore, would have 
been expanded more rapidly than mutations aris-
ing in less affluent classes. The scientists suggest
that the present-day Ashkenazi Jews may repre-
sent the descendents of a fairly small number 
(about a thousand or so) of this affluent group.
  Medical geneticist Arno Motulsky of the 
University of Washington at Seattle, who com-
mented on the Risch group's work in the same 
issue of Nature Genetics, says the Risch group has
presented an interesting and plausible story, but
one that needs to be confirmed by tracing the his-
tory of several more genes in the Ashkenazi 
Jewish population. Risch agrees, but he points out
that the evidence for the impact of genetic drift
can be seen in other populations that, like the
Jews, have expanded rapidly and have tended to 
be endogamous-~among them French Canadians,
the Amish and the Finns.-~Michelle Hoffman


havioral abnormalities (described as "hypersom-
nia" and "brain fever") in horses with the disease 
have been recognized for nearly 200 years. Experi-
mental infections of laboratory animals (rabbits, 
rats, tree shrews and non-human primates) pro-
duce a variety of behavioral symptoms ranging 
from agitation and aggression to abnormal social
interactions. Some infected animals display symp-
toms associated with human depression, including
excessive sleeping, passiveness and cognitive dif-
ficulties. Curiously, other species (mice and ham-
sters) do not manifest any abnormal behavior in
response to experimental infections of the virus.
  As yet there is no firmly established model of 
how the Borna disease virus might cause behav-
ioral abnormalities in animals or in people. Post-
mortem studies of animals with Borna disease sug-
gest that the virus targets certain parts of the limbic
system, a complex of structures in the brain that is
known to be involved in the expression of emo-
tions and affective disorders. Neurons in the hypo-
thalamus and the hippocampus appear to be espe-
cially prone to destruction by Borna viral infections.
  Another hint of the pathogenic mechanism
comes from a recent study by Georg Gosztonyi
and his colleagues of the Free University in 
Berlin. These authors showed that the Borna dis-
ease virus may interact with receptors in the hip-
pocampus for the excitatory amino acid neuro-
transmitters, aspartate and glutamate (Laboratory
Investigation March 1, 1993). Whether neuronal
destruction or neurochemical disruptions are in-
volved in human disease remains to be seen.
  Although the animal and human studies are
suggestive, virologist Joanna Pyper of the Johns
Hopkins School of Medicine, who reviewed 
Bode and colleagues' work in the same issue of
Nature Medicine, believes that the authors haven't
quite "nailed" the link between Borna disease 
virus and human neuropsychiatric illnesses. She

Colloidal Crystals

Solid particles suspended in fluid form ordered arrays
with unusual and useful physical properties

Cherry A. Murray and David G. Grier


It seems an easy, almost trivial task to
identify the states of matter that we
encounter in everyday life. Take a walk
in the woods and it is clear that the
trees are solid, the water in the creek is
liquid and the air, a gas. But what 
about the cells that make up the tree, or 
the mud at the bottom of the creek?
What state of matter do they fall into?
Are they solid or fluid? The answer is
both and neither.
  Cells and silt are both colloids, solid
particles suspended in a fluid. Colloids
differ from solutions in that the parti-
cles are large-~on the order of macro-
molecules such as fat, DNA or protein.
In fact, colloid particles are approxi-
mately 1,000 times the size of the mole-
cules making up the fluid. And they 
are not dissolved in the fluid, but
rather are dispersed throughout it. As
such, colloids represent a state of mat-
ter with properties unlike those of ei-

  If the suspended particles are espe-
cially large-~comparable to the wave-
lengths of visible light-~the colloid ac-
quires optical properties distinct from 
those of bulk materials. Repeated scat-
tering of light in a suspension of ran-
domly distributed fat particles produces
the cloudy opacity characteristic of milk.
The ability of colloids to scatter light was 
recognized and exploited long before
people could even begin to describe the 
chemical nature of colloids. Ink is one of 
the earliest manufactured colloids, used
in ancient Egypt and China. Latex paint
is a more recent invention made of latex
spheres suspended in water.
  More unusual still are the optical 
properties exhibited by ordered arrays 
of colloidal particles. Under the right 
conditions, colloidal particles arrange
themselves into ordered ranks, much
like the atoms in a crystal. But these col-
loidal crystals can be made to "melt"
into a disordered colloidal fluid again if
their container is shaken, as discovered 
by Bruce Ackerson of Oklahoma State 
University and Noel Clark of the Uni-
versity of Colorado in 1981. An ordered 
array of latex spheres in water gives off
vividly iridescent light, similar to that 
of a gem opal-~which is also a colloidal 
crystal of silica spheres from which the 
liquid has dried. The same optical
properties that make opals beautiful
can also have applications in advanced
optics and optoelectronics. Just as con-
ventional crystals are used as mono-
chromators for x rays, colloidal crystals
have been marketed as notch filters for
visible light by Sandy Asher of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh.
  Many of the intriguing properties of 
colloids are experimentally accessible,
as the large size of particles in colloids
also makes these suspensions ideal


subjects for scientific study. Unlike
atoms, colloidal particles with diame-
ters in the range of 0.1-1 micrometer in 
diameter can be easily seen under a 
light microscope, and their motions 
tracked with high resolution using dig-
ital-image processing. We have focused
our own studies on colloids of tailored 
size distributions as a simple, unique 
model system for studying the physics
of classical many particle systems. Our 
studies of monodisperse colloids (in 
which the size and spherical shape of
the particles and the net charges that
are chemically fixed on their surfaces 
by sulfonate groups are all identical to
within one percent) promise a deeper 
understanding of how colloidal sus-
pensions obtain some of their extraor-
dinary properties, but they also pro-
vide new insights into the behavior of
conventional materials and the mecha-
nisms of their transitions.

Properties of Colloids
All colloids are defined by the large 
size of the suspended particles and by 
the way those particles move in sus-
pension. The particles are larger than
single dissolved molecules, but are still 
small enough that random thermal 
"kicks" delivered by the fluid send
them on unpredictable random walks
and greatly reduce the rate at which 
they sediment under the influence of 
gravity. This motion of particles was
described in 1828 by Scottish botanist 
Robert Brown, who noted the erratic 
movement of pollen grains suspended
in water and later the same motion for 
pigments in dyes. This kind of move-
ment has since been termed "Brown-
ian motion" and is a defining feature
of colloids. Beyond Brownian motion
and the size range of particles, the par-

during the first testing phase, it was 
stronger in the last testing phase. The
average score was 87 percent in the 
case of stimuli that had been reas-
signed and 72 percent in the case of 
stimuli that had not been reassigned.
In other words, the generalization of 
retraining to all members of a category 
reliably exceeded the level of chance.
Merely by being associated with a 
common response, perceptually dis-
parate stimuli had amalgamated into a 
new category of functionally equiva-
lent stimuli.
  We were understandably pleased 
with our pigeons' performance, but 
without a basis of comparison, we 
weren't sure how pleased to be. To find
out we tried an analogous experiment
with 20 preschool children. The chil-
dren's response board was a large 
white poster with one central and four
peripheral boxes. The children were 
asked to place one of the 48 snapshots 
used in the pigeon experiment in the 
correct box. The investigator first 
placed a photograph in the central box
and asked the child to move it to one of
two boxes on a diagonal. (The boxes on
the other diagonal were covered by 
large X's to mark them as unavailable.)


If the child responded correctly, the in-
vestigator said "that is correct," and if 
he or she responded incorrectly, the in-
vestigator said "that is incorrect." Un-
like the pigeons, the children were not 
given correction trials if they responded 
incorrectly. 
  When a child had achieved a score of 
90 percent during at least one 12-trial
training block, he or she underwent re-
assignment training. During this step of
the experiment, two of the stimulus
classes were reassigned to the previous-
ly unavailable boxes. Once a child had 
reached 90 percent accuracy with the re-
assigned stimuli, he or she was shown
all 48 photographs in succession in a
single testing period. The boxes avail-
able during testing were the same two
available during reassignment training, 
and the reinforcement schedule for 
withheld stimuli was nondifferential.
The children's average score was 99 per-
cent for stimuli that had been reas-
signed and 80 percent for stimuli that
had not been reassigned.
  Compared to pigeons, the children
mastered the discrimination task faster
and reached higher levels of accuracy;
nevertheless the children's perfor-
mance was roughly comparable to that 
of the pigeons. If the children respond-
ed correctly to reassigned stimuli 99
percent of the time, the pigeons re-
sponded correctly 87 percent of the 
time during the equivalent testing 
phase of their longer experimental pro-
tocol. If the children responded cor-
rectly to stimuli that had not been reas-
signed 80 percent of the time, the
pigeons responded correctly 78 percent 
of the time. In both cases, association
with a common response was clearly 
sufficient to create a class of functional-
ly equivalent stimuli.
  These experiments were deliberately 
designed in such a way that the princi-
ple of perceptual proximity invoked to 
explain the earlier set of experiments
did not apply to them. What rule of 
learning do they support?
  A more advanced principle of asso-
ciative learning appears to fit the inter-
pretive bill. When two classes of stim-
uli are associated with a common overt 
response during training, they may 
come to elicit a common covert re-
sponse, perhaps a fractional or antici-
patory version of the final overt re-
sponse. Such a covert response might 
well serve as the bridge that allows 
stimuli withheld during reassignment 
training to produce the same response


as the reassigned stimuli with which 
they had been associated. 
  Invoking a covert mediating re-
sponse that can be shaped in much the
same way as an overt response is an old
theoretical maneuver of associationist
psychologists such as C. E. Osgood and
B. J. Underwood. But the mediated re-
sponse has recently undergone a high-
tech reincarnation; a hidden layer of
nodes in a multilayer neural network
provides a means of representing high-
er-level abstractions inferred from input
data, an ability beyond the scope of sim-
pler networks.
  If the mediating response still seems 
implausible, consider a more familiar 
example of reassignment training. Chil-
dren routinely learn to call socks, belts, 
pants and hats "clothing." This associa-
tive process, which probably proceeds 
by rote memorization, can be a very 
slow affair. Yet when children later learn 
that "apparel" is a synonym for "cloth-
ing," they are instantly able to call socks,
belts, pants and hats "apparel," and do
not need to explicitly learn that each ar-
ticle is a member of the new category.
The word "clothing" might well serve 
as a bridge between socks, belts, pants
and hats and the word "apparel," even 
though the child never says or is even 
aware of thinking this word.

tipped off about the action by an associate in the Zedillo

  This is, needless to say, not the way we expected busi-
ness to be conducted in the newest of First World countries. 
In Mexico City in March, I asked a dozen people-~liberal,

government-~the same question: "Is this a democracy?"

enue-sharing in the 1970s, and warns
against repeating those errors now. States
spend money sent them from
Washington with far less care than the
money they raise from their own taxpay-
ers. The arrival of billions of federal dol-
lars is more likely to relieve the states of
fiscal pressure to reform welfare and 
Medicaid than to spur dramatic action,
especially since, as liberal welfare critic
Mickey Kaus has written, the prevailing 
image of governors as reform crusaders
is utterly mistaken. 
  On the other hand, Pat Roberts's 
Four Days in February should remind us
that even a Republican-dominated 
Congress will almost certainly fail to
write an adequate welfare reform bill.
By the time Congress finishes with its
compromises and concessions, the
reform that emerges will not amount to
very much. Interviewed in March, 
Charles Murray said he remained cer-
tain that the only route to substantial
reform lay through the state capitals.
"With welfare," Murray said, "the only
way to get major reform is if one state 
demonstrates a very large effect and 
also demonstrates that you won't have
kids starving in the streets"-~by, for
example, eliminating all its existing 
welfare programs and devoting the 
money instead to adoption services.
  So who is right?

Despite the effective arguments of 
the block grant critics, the nod
has to go to the decentralizers. It 
should be clear by now that Murray got it 
right about the possibilities for real 
reform in the House. Now just imagine
what the far more conventional Senate
will do.
  As for the infirmities of state govern-
ments, remember that block grants, 
unlike Nixon-era revenue sharing, are
not exactly free money. These grants will 
come attached to substantial new respon-
sibilities for the states. And they will 
quickly prove far more fiscally constrict-
ing than most observers yet appreciate.
  Welfare programs are now designed 
for limitless growth. Medicaid is perhaps 
the single most shocking example-~up
from $20 billion a decade ago to nearly 
$100 billion this year-~but other pro-
grams, like Supplemental Security
Income, are mushrooming nearly as fast.
For Washington to control these costs, it
would have to rewrite the rules govern-


ing the programs-~a complicated, politi-
cally fraught, and time-consuming busi-
ness for a Republican majority with 
much else on its agenda.
  Devolution offers Republicans the 
chance to say, "That's it! The national 
contribution to the relief of poverty is"-~
pick a number-~"and not a dime more. It 
will be that same amount next year, or
quite possibly less, but it will be a number 
set as the result of democratic choice, and 
not by some out-of-control budget mecha-
nism." What would that mean in practice?
Picture a dog on a long chain that spots a 
cat across the road. It jumps upright and
sprints at top speed across the lawn-~until
the chain snaps it backward.
  Or, if you want numbers, look north-
ward at the Canadian experience. Virtually 
all of Canada's social programs are admin-
istered by the provinces; Ottawa tradition-
ally absorbed roughly half the costs. When 
the debt-plagued federal government 
decides to scale back, as it periodically 
does, all it need do is cut along the dotted 
line-~one reason that the Canadian federal 
budget unveiled on February 27 could
deliver actual dollar decreases in spending
on programs: C$119 billion was spent in 


the 1994-95 fiscal year; C$112 billion is
budgeted for 1995-96.
  The present division of welfare 
responsibilities between Washington and
the states tempts local governments into
reckless choices. Mario Cuomo's New
York spent twice as much per patient on
Medicaid as California, largely because
the governor convinced a large chunk of
his voters that the bill was being paid by
Washington-~as indeed nearly half of it
was. (With 7 percent of the nation's 
population and 9 percent of its Medicaid
patients, New York accounted for 20
percent of all federal Medicaid spending 
in Cuomo's last year in office.)
  There are only two ways out of this 
fix: either Washington must assert dra-
matically more authority over local deci-
sion-making, which few Republicans 
would favor, or else it must assert much 
less. States might abuse their new free-
dom by stubbornly refusing to reform,
but that would be their taxpayers' prob-
lem. With the status quo costing more
and more, and Washington contributing 
(as it surely will) less and less, even the
most troglodyte states will eventually
succumb to reform. ~


The moral of Donald Kagan's wise 
and compelling book was 
summed up neatly by the Roman
military commentator Flavius Ve-
getius-~si vis pacem, para bellum: "If
you want peace, prepare for war."
Kagan, former dean of Yale College and
now Bass Professor of History, Classics,
and Western Civilization at the universi-
ty, puts it thus: "Peace does not keep it-
self." Variations of the phrase recur in 
nearly every chapter of On the Origins of 
War. It is his theme, his message, his 
plea. "If the goal is to preserve peace,"
Kagan writes, "the worst mistake we can
make is to take inadequate measures to
that end because we do not comprehend 
the nature of the problem."
  Why do men go to war? Kagan argues 
that the best answer to the question is still
that of Thucydides-~people wage war
because honor, fear, or interest seems to
demand it. We can understand the latter 
two, but "honor" is more difficult; for 
many of us, the word has an archaic ring.
The Greek word, tim~~, encompasses not
only "honor" but also "esteem," "worth,"
"prestige," amour propre.
  In this book Kagan examines four wars, 
two ancient and two modern-~the
Peloponnesian War, the First World War,
the Second Punic War, the Second World 
War-~and one near-war-~the Cuban mis-
sile crisis. It is striking, he notes, what a rel-
atively small role "considerations of practi-
cal utility and material gain" played in these
conflicts. Fear was an important factor in
some of them. But perhaps the most impor-
tant consideration in each was tim~~.
  Professor Kagan has structured his 
book as a series of object lessons. The 
first two chapters, on the Peloponnesian


War (431-404 B.C.) and the First World 
War, form one pair. In these cases, the
balance of power was upset by the swift
expansion of power on one side: the
growth of the Athenian empire in the 
years following the war between the
Persian Empire and the Greeks, and 
Germany's drive to win European pre-
eminence in the years after Bismarck's
death. Athens struggled to keep the 
peace when a complicated system of
alliances was shaken by a few renegade 
city states, but Pericles pursued a policy 
that "was either too weak or too strong":
too weak to prevent an outlying city
from revolting, too strong to assuage 
Sparta's alarm about Athens's ultimate 
intentions.
  Similarly, the growth of German 
power between 1898 and 1914 meant 
that only "a large, well-trained British 
army that could quickly come to 
France's aid in case of attack" could
secure peace. To create such an army, the
British would have had to require con-
scription and the maintenance of a large
standing army in peacetime-~an almost
unthinkable contingency in nineteenth-
and early twentieth-century Britain,
although even the liberal John Stuart
Mill was in favor of it after the ignomin-
ious defeat of France in the Franco-
Prussian War. Real preparedness, how-
ever, was beyond the will of the British.
As with the Athenians, "their refusal to 
adjust their strategic capacity to their 
policy undermined their ability to con-
duct that policy." What seemed like the
counsel of prudence turned out to be a 
recipe for vacillation and indecisiveness:
qualities that form a nearly irresistible 
invitation to disaster.
  Kagan's discussion of "Hannibal's 
War" (the Second Punic War) and the 
Second World War present a different 

THE ANGLO-IRISH SPECTATOR


The Wolfman Cometh       by Stuart Reid


London

For a while there in March it looked 
bad. This time the Yanks had gone
too far. In tacos bars, in bowling
alleys, at Safeway checkouts-~wherever 
Englishmen traditionally gather-~there
was whispered talk of general mobilization
and of warehouses full of call-up papers.
The Brigade of Guards had been taking 
part in massive exercises on Salisbury
Plain, it was said, and with live ammuni-
tion; a squadron of Tornado GR1s had
been sent to Bermuda, flying at sea level
to avoid detection by U.S. radar; a pair of
Trident submarines had been spotted head-
ing down the Clyde Estuary for the North
Atlantic; John Mills had been seen enter-
ing the Admiralty wearing a khaki duffel
coat and a plucky frown ...
  President Clinton's decision to invite 
Gerry Adams to the White House on St.
Patrick's Day, against the express wishes of
the British government, and to allow him to 
raise funds in the U.S.-inspired a magnifi-
cent outbreak of anti-American fury here.
Even sane and sensible people were hurt.
John Major was so hurt that he refused to 
take a telephone call from the president, and
went off to the Middle East to shake hands
with Yassir Arafat. The wolfish Adams is 
the nearest thing we have to an Arafat. As 
head of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army, he is up to his 
molars in blood. The IRA is not an army,
and it does not represent the Irish Republic.
It is a terrorist organization that since 1969
has murdered more than 3,000 Britons. No
wonder the English sometimes make 
unkind (and probably illegal) jokes about
their Hibernian cousins. Question: Why did
the Irish get all the potatoes and the Saudi
Arabians all the oil? Answer: Because the
Irish had first choice.
  By far the most interesting, and


extreme, contribution to the Clinton-
Adams debate was made by John
Charmley, author of the recent critical life
of Winston Churchill. In the Sunday 
Telegraph, he aimed his sawn-off (but
elegantly fashioned) shotgun at the entire
American people, from Davy Crockett to 
Ollie North. The real problem, he wrote,
was that America had always been an
Imperial Republic intent on mischief.
  "Using the rhetoric of messianic
righteousness," he argued, "its rulers
first displaced the indigenous inhabitants 
of their continent before going on to lec-
ture the rest of the world on 'human
rights.'" Wilson and Roosevelt between
them had helped to dismantle the British
Empire, and now Clinton was, in effect, 
demanding an end to the union between
Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

Elsewhere columnists concentrated 
their fire on the president, who was
charged-~can you believe it?-~with
being more concerned to win the hearts and
minds and votes of his 40-million-strong
Irish-American constituency than to make
John Major a happy prime minister. In the
Sunday Express Bruce Anderson delivered 
himself of the not especially original idea
that Clinton was the worst president in
American history. "Behind the glad-hand-
ing, the smiles and the poses, the inner man
is negligible," he wrote. "There is no centre 
of gravity, no principle, no integrity: noth-
ing ... the decision to allow Gerry Adams 
and Sinn Fein to raise funds in America
takes Clinton to new depths of ignominy."
  One hesitates to defend Clinton, but
since Sinn Fein is allowed to raise money
in Great Britain there seems little reason
why it should not be allowed to raise 
funds in the United States. The British
government is employing a double stan-
dard, and not just in the matter of 
fundraising. It has itself been courting

Ohio; and Pueblo San Marcos,
New Mexico, whose inhabitants
once controlled the nearby Cerrillos
turquoise mines. It is also responsi-
ble for five preserves in heavily 
looted areas of Texas and Okla-
homa, where the mound-building 
Caddo culture flourished between 
ca. A.D. 700 and the mid-eighteenth 
century. Each spans a different 
Caddo period, allowing continued 
research on this most important of
early American chiefdoms. The
100th property, obtained in late 
1994, is the three-acre Lamb Spring 
site near Littleton, Colorado, a 
Paleo-Indian hunting and game-
processing area that may be one of 
the earliest of its kind in the United
States.
  The Conservancy accepts sites as
gifts, and works closely with land
developers whose projects impinge 
on prehistoric and historic sites.
They have achieved some remark-
able successes. In 1993 the Weyer-
hauser Real Estate Company was 
developing a planned community 
on the site of Fort Nisqually, a 
Hudson's Bay Company trading
post founded in 1832. The Conser-
vancy persuaded Weyerhauser to set
aside the site as open space in the
heart of its new community. E.I.
duPont de Nemours Company
donated an archaeological easement
on the site of Old Mobile, Ala-
bama, the first French settlement at
Mobile (1702-1711). Such transac-
tions benefit not only archaeology, 
but the developer, who receives a 
tax break and, more important, a 
positive public image. In other
cases, the Conservancy purchases
sites outright for the appraised value
of the land. The funds come from 
its 13,000 members, corporate 
sponsors, and private foundations.
In purchasing the Lamb Spring site, 
the Conservancy collaborated with
the Denver Museum of Natural 
History. The two organizations
raised matching funds against a
grant of $100,000 from the Col-
orado State Historical Fund.
  The Conservancy staff works 
closely with a  national board of

Dionysos, a Corinthian temple dedicated to the
emperor Antoninus Pius (A.D. 138-161), and a two-
story-high fountain with a facade of niches framed by 
columns. Wealthy local families vied to outspend each
other on monumental civic projects. Shortly after A.D.
120, one T. Flavius Severianus Neon financed the con-
struction of a new library in the upper city. The family
of T. Flavius Collega remodeled the old temple to
Apollo Klarios and transformed it into a sanctuary of 
the emperor cult. Between A.D. 160 and 180 a 
nymphaeum, or monumental fountain, in the form of a
theater facade was built along the northern side of the 
upper agora. Last year, during the excavation of the 
fountain, we uncovered five greater-than-life-size stat-
ues that once adorned its niches. These were carved in
fine marble imported from as far away as Dokimeion
and Aphrodisias, about 100 miles to the northeast and 
west, respectively. In the late second and early third
centuries A.D., the city built a new macellum, or food 
market, a large open-air theater, and a monumental 
gateway.
  The mid-third century saw more wars in Asia
Minor, including Gothic incursions in A.D. 255-277
and an invasion by Zenobia, queen of Palmyra in 
Syria, in A.D. 270. But Sagalassos seems not to have
suffered from these upheavals: the abundance of small-
denomination coins issued by the city probably reflects 
a flourishing state of commerce. Indeed the city sold
grain to the Roman armies in the East, or so it would 
seem from the many coins with depictions of wheat 
and legends reading "friend and ally of the Romans."
  Sagalassos witnessed another period of prosperity in
the mid-fourth and early fifth centuries A.D. Gothic and
Isaurian invasions of Pisidia in the later fourth century
forced the Romans to station a new garrison in Side, 
60 miles to the southeast, and Sagalassos seems once 
more to have reaped profits from grain deliveries to
the armies. During Julian's reign (A.D. 361-363), the
second-century library was renovated and embellished
with a mosaic depicting Achilles' departure for the
Trojan War. Construction activity culminated during
the late fourth century, when both agoras were
repaved and furnished with shops and porticoes, and a 
number of new monuments were built honoring mem-
bers of the Imperial family. Sometime during this 
period Sagalassos became an important bishopric, for
the city was represented at the First Council of Con-
stantinople in A.D. 381, which declared the Trinity to 
be an essential tenet of Christian doctrine.
  There are signs that Goths or Isaurians eventually
reached Sagalassos. Shortly after A.D. 400 the inhabi-
tants built an impressive fortification wall around the
civic center that incorporated a number of public 
buildings. The Kakasbos temple was turned into a 
watchtower that overlooked the northern approach to
the city. Construction of churches out of stone pilfered
from earlier monuments may mark the beginning of a 
decline in the city's fortunes. Earthquakes struck in A.D.


518 and 528, toppling buildings and destroying aque-
ducts. Primitive systems captured water where it was
still present, while squatters built makeshift homes 
inside porticoes and other public buildings. According 
to ancient historians, catastrophe struck once more in
A.D. 541-543, this time in the form of a plague that 
killed nearly half of Anatolia's population. Ceramic
production ended in the city, though it has continued 
in the valleys below in a debased form until today.
  Sagalassos seems to have been abandoned shortly
after the middle of the seventh century, the date of the
latest artifacts (coins and small terra-cotta amphorae
known as unguentaria) discovered so far. Arabs invading
from Syria between A.D. 644 and 696 may have dealt
the final blow, convincing a shrunken population to
give up a city that it could no longer defend. Some of
the inhabitants settled in nearby A~~lasun, where the
bishopric of Sagalassos survived until the twelfth cen-
tury. Pollen samples from A.D. 400-1050 indicate that 
pine forests gradually replaced the nut orchards that
had flourished since the sixteenth century B.C. An
increase of sheep and goat remains during this period
may reflect a neglect of fields in favor of herding, a rel-
atively low-intensity form of food production. This shift
toward herding, together with the recovery of the
forests, points to a declining population. After ca. 1050
the pollen record shows signs of shrinking forests and
overgrazing, perhaps caused by the arrival of Turkmen
tribesmen from Iran. This chronic abuse of the land
eventually produced the scoured landscape we see 
today.
  Our excavations at Sagalassos are far from com-
plete, but we have already learned a great deal about
one of the best preserved provincial towns of classical 
antiquity. Our quest for the past has been full of sur-
prises. We have identified one of the major ceramic
producers of Roman Asia Minor, a source whose wares 
flooded southern Turkey for five centuries. We have
also begun to discredit an age-old myth about the 
region's people. Ancient historians tell of a Hellenistic
Pisidia inhabited solely by tribal barbarians living by 
pillaging and brigandage, and this image has survived 
in a great deal of modern scholarship. Perhaps a sense
of accomplishment at conquering such a warlike people
led Roman chroniclers to glorify themselves at the
expense of their new subjects. With its sculptures and
temples, its agoras and fountains, Sagalassos was any-
thing but uncivilized and uncultured. Those same 
"barbarian" Pisidians had helped make it a cosmopoli-
tan and thoroughly Hellenized city. ~


loquially called the Jerusalem Syndrome,
an affliction peculiar to travelers to Jer-
usalem who snap under the historical and
religious weight of the city and begin to
believe that they themselves are the Mes-
siah or the Virgin or King David or, more 
commonly, God or Satan. Many of these 
people have strikingly similar spiritual 
histories: a deeply religious childhood 
followed by an adolescent rebellion
against their faith and an eventual falling
away. Backsliders appear to be far more 
vulnerable to the syndrome, because their
image of Jerusalem is sometimes drawn 
in a child's hand, unamended by adult
reasoning.
  The sufferers are of two types-~those
who arrive in Jerusalem with a history of
psychological or behavioral problems and
those without any sign or record of past 
psychiatric problems. The former group 
comprises 82 percent of the sufferers, ac-
cording to Witztum. But those in the latter 


group, who are exhibiting what psychia-
trists call the syndrome proper, are the 
more perplexing of the two types. Most
believe for an average of five to seven 
days that they are some form of divinity;
then they step back into the milder reli-
gious atmosphere of America or Europe 
as if nothing had happened. Of these,
most are surprisingly responsive to thera-
py. Witztum described one such patient
who spoke of the experience as being 
rather like intoxication. In the summer of 
1986 he entered the Holy Sepulchre and
was overcome by the feeling that he was 
Jesus. When he began sharing this con-
viction aloud with his tour group, he was 
taken to Kfar Shaul psychiatric hospital, 
where he was treated by the hospital's di-
rector, Yair Bar El. Within five days he 
was fine. He returned to his homeland, 
got married, and remains baffled about
what happened. He is extraordinarily po-
lite, as are many of the victims of the 
syndrome proper, most of whom don't
rant but simply worry that they might be 
Jesus.
  The former patient would like to return
to Jerusalem for a visit but worries that
the syndrome will strike again-~as if Je-
rusalem were the problem. Witztum con-
curs. "This case was a reaction to a place,
not a true psychosis," he says. In a new
entry on the syndrome in the Encyclopae-
dia Britannica, the question is asked,
"Does Jerusalem's religious atmosphere
actually induce psychiatric disturbance in
the vulnerable visitor?" Though there is 
no definitive answer yet, Witztum be-
lieves that the "unique atmosphere" of 
Jerusalem together with the complexities 
of the human psyche may be more than 
some travelers can manage.
  In order to explain the syndrome, Witz-
tum differentiates between pilgrims and 
tourists. A tourist moves from the center
of his existence, his home, to the periph-
ery, in order to vacation. A pilgrim, how-
ever, moves from the periphery to the 
center of his world. Perhaps the best defi-
nition of "center" in this context was giv-
en by the religious historian Mircea Eli-
ade, who wrote that the center is where
the "axis mundi [the center axis of mean-
ing] penetrates the earthly sphere."
  Once a tiny hilltop fortification, Jerusa-
lem has come to be the axis mundi for
three of the world's major religions, where
heaven descends to touch and bless the 
earth; Witztum calls the city "the umbili-

  I followed Rajinder into the bedroom, and the terror was
gone, an open door now shut, and again I felt nothing, as if I 
were marble inside. The two rooms were exactly alike, ex-
cept the bedroom was empty. "And there, the bed," Rajinder
said, placing it with a slight wave of his hand against the 
wall across from the window. He spoke slowly and firmly, as 
if he were describing what was already there. "The fridge 
we can put right there," at the foot of the bed. Both were part
of my dowry. Whenever he looked at me, I either said yes or 
nodded my head in agreement. We went outside and he
showed me the kitchen and the bathroom, which were con-
nected to the flat but could be entered only through doors
opening onto the roof.
  From the roof, a little after eleven, I watched Rajinder
drive away on his scooter. He was going to my parents' flat
in the Old Vegetable Market, where my dowry and our wed-
ding gifts were stored. I had nothing to do while he was 
gone, so I wandered in and out of the flat and around the 
roof. Defense Colony was composed of rows of pale two- or
three-story buildings. A small park, edged with eucalyptus
trees, was behind our house.
  Rajinder returned two hours later with his elder brother,
Ashok, and a yellow van. It took three trips to bring the TV,
the sofa, the fridge, the mixer, the steel plates, and my clothes.
 Each time they left, I wanted them never to return. Whenever
they pulled up outside, Ashok pressed the horn, which played 
"Jingle Bells." I was frightened by Ashok, because, with his
handlebar moustache and muscular forearms, he reminded me
of my father's brothers, who, my mother claimed, beat their 
wives. Listening to his curses drift out of the stairwell each
time he bumped against a wall while maneuvering the sofa,
TV, and fridge up the stairs, I felt ashamed, as if he were curs-
ing the dowry and, through it, me.
  On the first trip they brought back two suitcases that my
mother had packed with my clothes. I was cold, and when 
they left, I changed in the bedroom. My hands were trem-
bling by then, and each time I swallowed, I felt a sharp pain
in my throat that made my eyes water. Standing there in the 
room gray with dust, the light like cold, clear water, I felt sad
and lonely and excited at being naked in an empty room in a 
place where no one knew me. I put on a sylvar kamij, but
even completely covered by the big shirt and pants, I was
cold. I added a sweater and socks, but the cold had slipped
under my skin and lingered beneath my fingernails.
  Rajinder did not appear to notice I had changed. I swept
the rooms while the men were gone, and stacked the 
kitchen shelves with the steel plates, saucers, and spoons
that had come as gifts. Rajinder and Ashok brought all the 
gifts except the bed, which was too big for them. It was 
raised to the roof by pulleys the next day. They were able
to bring up the mattress, though, and the sight of it made 
me happy, for I knew I would fall asleep easily and that an-
other eight hours would pass. 
  We did not eat lunch, but in the evening I made rotis and


lentils on a kerosene stove. The kitchen had no light bulb, and
I had only the stove's blue flame to see by. The icy wind
swirled around my feet. Nearly thirty years later I can still re-
member that wind. I could eat only one roti, while Rajinder
and Ashok had six each. We sat in the living room, and they
spoke loudly of their family's farm, gasoline prices, politics in
Haryana, and Indira Gandhi's government. I spoke once, say-
ing that I liked Indira Gandhi, and Ashok said that was be-
cause I was a Delhi woman who wanted to see women in 
power. My throat hurt and I felt as if I were breathing steam.
  Ashok left after dinner, and Rajinder and I were truly alone
for the first time since our marriage. Our voices were so re-


spectful, we might have been in mourning. He took me silent-
ly in the bedroom, on the mattress beneath the window with 
the full moon peering in. When it was over and Rajinder was 
sleeping, I lifted myself on an elbow to look at him. I felt
somehow that I could look at him more easily while he was
asleep. I would not be nervous, trying to hide my scrutiny, and
if the panic came, I could just hold on until it passed. I thought
that if I could see him properly just once, I would no longer be
frightened; I would know what kind of a man he was and what
the future held. But the narrow mouth and the stiff, straight
way he slept, with his arms folded across his chest, said one
thing, and the long, dark eyelashes denied it. I stared at him
until he started flickering, and then I closed my eyes.

THREE months earlier, when our parents introduced
us, I did not think we would marry. The neutrality of
Rajinder's features, across the restaurant table from me, re-
assured me that we would not meet after that dinner. It was
not that I expected to marry someone particularly handsome.
I was neither pretty nor talented, and my family was not rich.
But I could not imagine spending my life with someone so
anonymous. If asked, I would have been unable to tell what
kind of man I wanted to marry, whether he should be hand-
some and funny. I was not even certain I wanted to marry, 
though at times I thought marriage would make me less
lonely. What I wanted was to be with someone who could 
make me different, someone other than the person I was.
  Rajinder did not appear to be such a man, and although
the fact that we were meeting meant that our families ap-
proved of each other, I still felt safe. Twice before, my par-

can solve problems. But once you get into things like
crime, welfare, and education, you're trying to change hu-
man behavior, and that's much tougher to do. The New
Deal was small potatoes compared to most of this stuff."
  "Several things happen when the government gets into
these areas," says James Q. Wilson, a professor of manage-
ment and public policy at the University of California at Los
Angeles. "First, no one really knows how to solve these
problems. Second, the public itself is deeply conflicted about
most of these issues; you rarely have a consensus from 
which to act. Third, these issues tend to be so complex that
they overwhelm the process. And finally, when these mea-
sures fail to do much to solve something like crime-~which
is what inevitably happens-~they greatly reinforce the gen-
eral disillusionment with government. There's something to 
be said for sticking with what you know how to do."
  During that legislative blizzard Congress was no longer
just distributing money or dealing with problems in discrete
areas (how to regulate the airwaves, or how to provide a sup-
plemental income to senior citizens), and the grand problems
it confronted, like poverty and crime, seemed to require a 
variety of coordinated strategies. "That was a key mistake,"
Theodore Lowi says. "Health and welfare are not holistic
things; they're a collection of problems. The bills collapse 
of their own weight." Such bills also tend to be so elaborate
that voters have difficulty understanding them-~which
means, at a minimum, that opponents have an easy time rais-


ing fears about them. Unsurprisingly, the public becomes
more engaged when Congress is debating a seemingly 
straightforward issue like the Gulf War, in which voters can
understand what is at stake.
  Nonetheless, over time congressmen on both sides of the
aisle began drafting longer, more comprehensive bills; the
number of pages of law entered into the statute books dur-
ing the relatively uneventful 1991-1992 session was two
and a half times the number entered by the 1965-1966 
Great Society Congress. With many legislators continually
preoccupied by issues of openness and equal availability of
services, access and due process became legislative focuses.


That translated into greatly increased complexity and bu-
reaucracy, not to mention a drain on the courts as litigants
attempted to enforce their new rights. In 1936 there were 
2,355 pages of regulations amplifying federal laws pub-
lished in the Federal Register. By 1969 the number had 
risen to 20,464 pages; in the 1990s the register has been av-
eraging about 60,000 pages a year.

No Amendments
Wanted

TRYING to solve a national megaproblem with one
huge bill is still an American obsession, as the recent
health-care debate showed. Still, by the late 1960s the
old model of legislating had begun to fall out of favor, at
least in one respect. The criticism, advanced by Ralph Nad-
er and others, was that administrative agencies such as the 
Interstate Commerce Commission and the Federal Commu-
nications Commission inevitably became controlled by the
forces they were supposed to regulate. Moreover, distrust of
authority was expanding along with voting rights, and there
was a corresponding lack of trust in the opinions of experts
vis-~~-vis "the people." As David Schoenbrod, a professor at
New York Law School, has related in Power Without Re-
sponsibility (1993), what followed was a series of congres-
sional statutes (beginning with the Clean Air Act, in 1970),
passed with bipartisan support, that started to abandon the


concept of open-ended delegation to independent agencies. 
Instead these laws essentially ordered the agency in question
to take action and gave "elaborate instructions about the 
goals that it should achieve and the procedures for promul-
gating them." These instructions often placed administrative
obligations on the states, while Congress took credit for the
benefits of the legislation.
  As a result of this legislative model statutes not only be-
came lengthier and more complicated but also began running 
up hidden costs, while parochial and elite interests inevitably 
asserted their influence with help from both sides of the aisle:
it was Alaska's Republican senator Ted Stevens, after all,


ALTHOUGH MANY OF THE REPUBLICAN PROPOSALS

and South Africa.
  To better understand the potential of the 
South African market, BLACK ENTERPRISE
spent several weeks in South Africa last
October. In addition to speaking to 
African-Americans and South Africans in
business and government, BE was also rep-
resented at the Made In USouth Africa
Expo, a Johannesburg-based exhibition of
goods and services attracting over 230
exhibitors. (See sidebar, "Resources To 
Help You Tap Into South African
Markets," for details on these and other
programs designed to open up South 
African markets to American entrepre-
neurs.)
  What we found was that the African-
American presence in South Africa was 
striking. There were black corporate exec-
utives from AT&T, Duracell and Chrysler
at the Made In USouth Africa Expo. More
than 30 African-American companies paid 
up to $7,500 for a booth, lodging and air-
fare with no guarantee of contracts to
attend this event. These included several 
BE 100s companies new to the South
African marketplace. Hair care products
manufacturer Luster Products of Chicago
and BET International, a subsidiary of 
Washington-based Black Entertainment
Television, which broadcasts programs on 
a South African network, were among the 
newcomers. There have been joint ven-
tures between major corporations, African-
American investors and black South
Africans. A prominent example is New
Age Beverages Ltd., a joint venture 
between Pepsi-Cola International and 
Egoli Beverages LP, announced last June.
New Age Beverages is a Pepsi bottling 
franchise owned by black South Africans
in partnership with Egoli Beverages Ltd., a
consortium that includes prominent
African-Americans, such as BE Publisher
Earl Graves, attorney Johnny Cochran and
actor Danny Glover.
  For three African-American enterprises, 
venturing into South Africa has already
begun to bear fruit. The first are corporate 
lawyers who put down their torts and
moved to Johannesburg to open a chain of
laundry centers. The next is a veteran 
telecommunications company owner 
whose appraisal of South Africa's emerging
black business class led him to enter the 
hot cellular phone industry with a South 
African partner. Finally, two New York


  But there are also differences in the way 
that business is conducted in South Africa
compared with this country. For instance,
Felicia Mabuza-Suttle, the host of the pop-
ular South African talk show, Top Level, is
very familiar with these differences. After
all, Mabuza-Suttle spent 20 years in 
America. She advises Americans that they 
must learn to build trust in a society that
moves more slowly and makes decisions
more deliberately. For example, she notes
that black South Africans never talk busi-
ness before enquiring about one's health or
family. And as more Americans arrive, they
have to avoid gaining the reputation, as she
puts it, of "coming over, picking their
brains, then, when they need to form part-
nerships, linking up with whites or some
other non-black South African group,"
concludes Mabuza-Suttle, who is also
executive manager, corporate relations
worldwide, for South African Airways.
  Samuel Noinyane agrees. He is chairman
of Odyssey Sports (Pty) Ltd., which con-  


trols Nike Corp.'s distribution in southern
Africa. He believes that African-Americans
and black South Africans can prosper 
together, but only if "marriages of mutual
understanding and assistance" are created.
He contends that white South Africans 
prefer to work with black South Africans
because they are a known-~and malleable, 
or so they believe-~entity. "We need to 
gain the Afro-American business and tech-
nical knowledge apart from the whites and
then use it on them to get what we want,"
Noinyane emphasizes.
  Managing expectations is another critical 
factor. Demand for job training in post-
apartheid South Africa is intimidatingly 
high. You will be under tremendous pres-
sure-~in the form of angry protests-~to 
provide training and opportunities for
black South Africans. It is important that
you do not promise more than you can 
deliver, and that you make clear how you
intend to integrate South Africans into the
labor and management of your business.

its winemaking. Close to 100 wines are now available in the
U.S. And South Africa's small, independent wineries are
making some of the country's most interesting wines.
  One of the first to see the promise in his country's wines
was Jabulani Ntshangase, a black South African wine whole-
sale distributor in New York. Soon after Nelson Mandela's 
release, Ntshangase and Andre Shearer, a fellow South 
African, who is white, formed Cape Classics, an import com-
pany devoted solely to high quality South African wines.
With elections came "euphoria," says Ntshangase. "If we
have a problem now, it's that we represent small wineries 
with limited productions, and their wines are selling so well,
we're running out."
  Of South Africa's white wines, the most exceptional is
Sauvignon Blanc. It is, in fact, one of the finest examples of 


sively, sees Pinotage as the country's signature wine. "It's 
very appealing, modestly priced and delicious," he says.
  South Africa also makes impressive Shiraz-~a firm,
intense, spicy, peppery red wine. Notable labels are those of
Lievland, La Motte and Rust en Vrede. The country also
produces a Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet
Franc. But far more striking are the wines made from a blend 
of these red grapes. Most distinguished are Rozendal Farm,
Rubicon of Meerlust, and La Femme Bleu and Trilogy, both
from the Warwick Winery.
  Most South African wines range from $5.50 to $25 in price,
with many of the best costing $8 to $14 per bottle. Not bad
for wines that have spent long years waiting in the wings. At
last, South Africa is making its presence known again.

was a first step; next we want to provide a 
single image of the network file system."
Volumes would thus be completely logical 
and locationless, so you could map to any
resource on the network.
  Of course, a single system image does 
not imply that all or even any of the pro-
grams you use are executing on a central 
server using the shared-logic model of 
mainframes and minicomputers. But sig-
nificant parts of a distributed application 
could be executing on a central system,
depending on such factors as the location
of the target data, network load balancing,
or the capabilities of the central machine 
(i.e., if it is optimized for ad hoc queries,
floating-point calculations, or rendering).

The Cost of Data
One of the main factors encouraging dis-
tributed computing is the cost of data com-
munications, in terms of both performance


communications can promote either cen-
tralization or decentralization. (The for-
mer, because it reduces the penalty of ac-
cessing shared data; the latter, because it
makes distributing data faster and less ex-
pensive.) But bandwidth isn't the only fac-
tor. Latency is also a key performance is-
sue. "The speed of access to disks is much 
better-~on the order of milliseconds-~if
you're closer, compared to hundreds of 
milliseconds or more if you go out across 
the network," he says. Certain classes of
problems have an "affinity" for data and 
are thus better addressed on a central com-
puter.
  Centralization doesn't imply using tra-
ditional mainframes; you can build net-
works around fault-tolerant Unix machines 
or NetFrame superservers. Vendors of such
mainframe-replacement systems normally
sing the praises of centralization. "Tan-
dem has been able to do distributed pro-
cessing forever, with a single system image
across hundreds of processors," says 
Edwards. "But people still choose to cen-
tralize because of security and easier sys-
tem management." And, she adds, cen-
tralized systems reduce MIS staffing needs
compared to setups that require a system
administrator in every office.
  "It's easier to distribute applications 
rather than data," Amdahl says. He adds 
that distributed data is harder to control,
and you have to administer tricky data-
base tasks, such as replication and ver-
sioning. "The last thing IS people want to
do," Amdahl says, "is to partition data
across more than one machine." What hap-
pens if the network breaks and parts of the

tutorials on how to create the transitions
with a selection of digital-editing software.

Capture Conflicts
To digitize our taped demonstrations, we
first used the Orchid Videola Premium.
After trying almost every configuration
combination imaginable, we got the video
capture working-~or so we thought. When 
we dumped the captured clip into Adobe
Premiere (our editing software), the video
was consecutive frames of solid pink.
  Orchid technical support came up with
a solution: Go into Gateway's BIOS setup
and disable BIOS shadowing. That trick
let us capture some excellent video clips
using Orchid's Motion JPEG compression 
(an optional daughtercard is required for
M-JPEG).
  Unfortunately, the Videola requires a 
VGA feature connector, which limits your


desktop resolution to 640 by 480 pixels.
(In theory, you should be able to get up to
an 800- by 600-pixel resolution desktop,
but we never got stable output at the higher
resolution.) Adobe Premiere and other dig-
ital video editors present a full desktop
with an assortment of tool palettes and
windows. You also must work with a time
line packed with video strips, transition
effects, and audio waveforms. It's simply
too much interface for anything less than a 
1024- by 768-pixel resolution desktop.
 Many alternatives can replace the fea-
ture-connectors (faster local-bus architec-
tures such as PCI [Peripheral Component
Interconnect], better compression schemes,
integrated chips that combine Windows
acceleration with motion-video support,
and architectural solutions such as VESA
Media Channel). At this point, we don't
recommend a feature-connector solution.


  The best answer is a turnkey solution.
We solicited Smart and Friendly's MPEG
Creation Station, a well-conceived bun-
dle of products that comprises all the pieces
you'll need to generate MPEG titles. Smart
and Friendly offers the MPEG Creation
Station as a turnkey system, but when we
started our project, the components were
only available separately. That's a lot of 
stuff to get working in a single PC.
  We ran into problems trying to get the 
Fast Movie Machine to work (the capture 
component of the MPEG Creation Sta-
tion). The Movie Machine supports an
optional Motion-JPEG board that occu-
pies its own slot, interrupt, and address
space. When we first installed it, the 
motion-video input displayed on screen,
but it wasn't aligned in the capture win-
dow. When we tried to load the alignment
controls, we were unceremoniously

Hardware


says the display shortages that have de-
layed orders for some ThinkPads aren't a 
factor for the 701C, thanks in part to out-
sourcing from Sharp.
  The 701C comes with audio and tele-
phony features similar to those of the larg-
er and faster 755C, but because of its slid-
ing keyboard, the 701C doesn't have space
for a CD-ROM drive. The 701C's modem 
isn't upgradable from 14.4 Kbps. With a 
256-color palette, the 701C doesn't have 
the 755C's more sophisticated graphics
system (65,536 colors at VGA resolutions).
Finally, the 701C can't capture or output
broadcast-standard video.
  The 701C does, however, shine among 
portables for pleasantness to use and for
flat-out coolness. Cha-chunk may soon
become the sound of status for those who
live much of their life at 35,000 feet. ~

CHESS CONGRESS SOUTH


by Walter Schaetzle

THE TOURNAMENT BEGAN AMID
threats of severe thunderstorms and tor-
nadoes. The youngest player, Thomas
Avery (6) from Miami, Florida, stormed 
in to play chess. With a shark through his
hat, he played like GM Walter Browne
with an intensity one could not only see
but feel. After winning trophies in the
Blitz and Bughouse tournaments, he won
the eight-and-under section with a per-
fect score.
  The tournament, held at the Marriott
Hotel in Huntsville, Alabama, had close
to 150 players from 11 different states. At 
least one player from each state won a 
trophy. The chief tournament director 
was Frank Camaratta. He was assisted by
Kenneth Sloan, Jack Mallory, Harry
Sabine, Bill Melvin, Bill Savoie, John
Schweinsberg, Philip Creel, James Reed-
er, Kyle Therrell and Dick Rhea
  The tournament was organized by Wal-
ter and Dorothy Schaetzle with the help 
of numerous volunteers including James
and Barbara Reeder, Mary Francis
Thomas, Michael Schaetzle, James 
Schaetzle, Bill Melvin and many others.
Amanda Newsom, a sixth-grade student,
designed the logo used on the tourna-
ment program and the T-shirt. The USCF
was represented by President Denis
Barry and his lovely wife, Doris and
Steve Miller.
  Many players made the 100-yard walk
to the U.S. Space and Rocket Center for
an update on our space program. The 
hotel provided outstanding service with
a "fast food bar at fast food prices" just
outside the playing area. Many took
advantage of the breakfast bar with spe-
cial prices for chessplayers.
  Richard Benjamin, a life master from
Atlanta, Georgia, gave a regular simulta-

rell, a life master from Birmingham, Ala-
bama, gave a clock simultaneous on
Sunday night.  ~

clusive evidence. Mikhail Braude, a Rus-
sian emigre living in Florida and studying 
in Rhode Island, was ranked 35th in the 
nation with a rating of 2553 at the time of
this game. Undaunted, Curdo played 
sharply from the beginning, sacking a
pawn early for open lines, then giving up 
his queen in a pretty combination that
eventually left him up a double Exchange

of rook and two disconnected pawns vs. 
Rook are normally theoretical wins
except when the defender has the a- and

technique is to activate the king and aim

Etienne Bacrot of France and 27-year-old IM Michele Gode-
na, Champion of Italy in 1992 and 1993. FM Bacrot is
already World and European Youth Champion in various 
categories and has a 2300 FIDE Rating. He is reportedly the
most popular chess figure for the French media with hardly
a week passing by without a major television, newspaper
or magazine feature about him. Yet the more experienced 
IM carried the day easily, winning the first two games, draw-
ing the next two, and closing with two more victories for a
5-1 result. The winner's purse was 4000 FF; the loser 
received 2000 FF.

Dough-Cutting Hints
  I enjoyed your recipe for 
empanadas in the August 1994
issue. My wife, who just returned
from a year-long assignment with
the US Air Force in Honduras,
declared them equal to any that
she had eaten there. I have a cou-
ple of comments, however. Maybe
I just haven't figured out how to 
roll the dough for the crust thin
enough, but it took three crust 
recipes to use up the filling! (I
turned this to my advantage,
though, because I was able to
make some snack-sized 
empanadas on short notice for a
Christmas party I was invited to).
My other comment concerns cut-
ting out the "blanks" for the
empanadas. The recipe calls for

Although I had crossed the Great

thought myself quite the camelteer,
Clyde was out to teach me other-
wise. "Clyde is very bad some-

  I did invite my friends from the

very rich-tasting and cooked with a

mother. The butcher did come to 
the feast and several of the testimo-

with him. I took even more of the

AYAM LEMAK (CHICKEN 
COOKED IN SPICY COCONUT 
MILK GRAVY)

  We often ate chicken while in
Malaysia, not just because it's a sta-
ple of our diet back home, but 
because we knew it would be fresh.
The live caged chickens we saw at 
the daytime Central Market, where
the townspeople shopped, often 
became the main course at Night
Market a few hours later.

  1 large onion, diced
  3 fresh red chiles, such as serrano
    or cayenne, stems and seeds
    removed, finely chopped


  1 tablespoon grated lemon rind
  2 teaspoons grated ginger
  3 to 4 tablespoons vegetable oil
  1~~~ teaspoons ground turmeric
  1 teaspoon ground black pepper
  1 3-pound chicken, cut in
    serving pieces
  3 cups unsweetened coconut milk 
  1 cup water
  1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil

  Place the onion, chiles, lemon
rind, ginger and 1 tablespoon oil in 
a blender or food processor and
puree until a thick paste is formed.
Add the turmeric and black pepper
and process for an additional 
minute. Spread the paste mixture 
on the chicken pieces until well-
coated.
  Combine the remaining oil with
any remaining blender mixture and
saut~~, stirring constantly, for 15
minutes. Add the chicken and fry,
turning often, for another 15 min-
utes or until chicken is well-
browned. Add the coconut milk, 
water and basil and simmer, uncov-
ered, until chicken is completely
cooked, adding additional water if

to print for reliable news. It did loosen up in
1976 (allowing TV advertising) and increased 
entertainment programs in 1984, but it was 
not until 1992 that real changes occurred. A 
bold expatriate businessman, Subhash
Chandra, launched the first Hindi-language
satellite network, Zee TV, whose taped pro-
grams, though made in India, were shipped 
to Hong Kong, then beamed by satellite not
only back to India but to most of the Mid-
dle East as well. The Indian Telegraph Act,
which banned unauthorized ground-to-
ground transmissions within India, had
been leapfrogged by new technology.
  The satellite network prompted ad
agencies to churn out TV spots boosting 
everything from whisky to laptops and 
detergents. Zee TV became, overnight, a
runaway success: Murdoch promptly 
acquired a 50 percent stake and launched
two more satellite channels out of Hong
Kong. Other networks followed, beaming 
their signals in English, Hindi, Telugu, 
Tamil and Bengali. They were joined by


the BBC. Cable distribution and pay-TV
companies began signing up subscribers 
in all major towns, with the government
turning a blind eye.
  In December 1994, Zee TV began its
twin film channel, capitalizing on the stag-
gering loyalty of its fans: The post office in 
Worli District, near Zee TV's cramped 
Bombay headquarters, has hired 30 extra
postal workers to cope with the 350,000
postcards arriving daily. And Zee TV 
CEO Digvijay Singh is launching a Zee
TV cable network designed for Indian


households in Britain and hopes to be 
operating in the U.S. soon.
  All told, some 30 satellite channels now
beam programs into Indian homes through-
out Asia and most of the Middle East. By 
1997, experts predict, there will be more than
100 satellite channels. Costs will drop when
the Indian Telegraph Act is repealed and
programs no longer have to be bounced off 
transponders from outside India.
  In response, DD has overhauled its pro-
gramming. DD Metro, a brash entertain-
ment channel (and carbon copy of MTV),
has become hugely popular. DD1, the for-
mer government monopoly, now offers
popular films, soaps, and quiz and game
shows; from time to time it tackles con-
troversial topics, even airing a recent debate
titled "What's Wrong with Doordarshan?"
  Though the two DD channels are more 
accessible, requiring neither dishes nor
cable fees, and still have about 70 percent of
the expanded TV advertising market, DD's
civil-servant managers recognize their for-


midable competition. Zee TV's Aap Ki
Adalat (Your Own Court), in which ex-
newspaper editor Rajat Sharma grills
politicians before a delighted live audience,
has 100 million viewers. The program is
revolutionizing India's notoriously corrupt
political scene. "Politicians now think twice 
before making demagogic promises," says 
Sharma. Combining the smiling charm of
a Charlie Rose with the inquisitorial skill of 
a Mike Wallace, he has no qualms about ask-
ing tough personal questions, admitting he
has learned a lot from watching 60 Minutes.
Sharma's huge success has compelled
politicians to hire ad agencies to school 
them in how to face the camera.
  TV's impact on Indian society is still
largely unknown. But the proliferation of 
"Hinglish" channels, with video jockeys
openly copying the mannerisms of their
MTV mentors, has accelerated the gener-
ation gap. "There's a new language emerg-
ing on television," says sociologist Ashis
Nandy, "and it's largely gibberish to older
people." Overtly sexual scenes on TV not
only upset traditionalists but have troubled
some adolescents brought up in puritanical
family environments. TV has also triggered
a new crime wave, but in an overwhelmingly
Indian context: "There have been a fright-
ening number of instances where elderly
people living alone have been murdered
by greedy servants or local oddjobsmen
solely to lay hands on their TV sets or their
VCRs," says Nandy. "I expect an enormous 
rise in crime as India's increasingly uproot-
ed underclass, that has not profited from the
boom, watches soaps where everyone lives 
like millionaires." Despite the exposure to 
new lifestyles, he says, Indian family rela-
tionships remain strong. "We Indians
already live in a multicultural society, and
are assimilating what we watch as just
another alien culture to be observed, but not
necessarily followed."
  And in the state of Goa, one of Nandy's 
students discovered that most of those he
polled assume that cops-and-robbers
soaps, whether imported or Indian-made,
are true-life documentaries extolling the
work of the police. And the power of TV 
advertising has had unexpected repercus-
sions. Whenever spots show actors in 
white coats promoting pharmaceutical
goods, an overwhelming majority assumes
that these are real doctors imparting not
blurbs, but professional advice that should
not be ignored.  ~


~ Communal sets: For hours at a time, in villages and urban slums, people sit watching a single screen

ing in Whitman's desk and found "the Blue Book," his personal 
copy of Leaves, which he was constantly annotating for revision.
"What instinct ever drove him to my desk?" Whitman won-
dered. "He must have had some intimation from some one
that I was what I was."
  Not who, but what. To most of postbellum America, he was still
a sexual pariah. Drum-Taps seemed only to rouse greater scorn
from critics who should have known better. This attempt by "an
essentially prosaic mind to lift itself, by a prolonged muscular

other than the young Henry James. James eventually apologized for
this "little atrocity," having come to see Whitman as America's 
greatest poet. But that was four decades later, while reading 
"Lilacs" aloud to Edith Wharton.
  Whitman did have a cadre of staunch Washington friends. 
After his dismissal, William Douglas O'Connor drafted a 15-
page letter of defense and protest to Harlan; it was never sent,
but he later turned it into a 48-page biographical sketch, The 
Good Gray Poet. John Burroughs, who with his wife, Ursula,
often got Whitman going with breakfast or settled with din-
ner, managed to get him a post with Attorney General Edward
Bates, former governor of Missouri, who delighted in his

area could serve some of the processional
purposes of the old basilica-nave.
  After Michelangelo scrapped Sangallo's
design, his own work was altered to com-
promise the Greek-cross plan (already
begun by Bramante and advanced by San-
gallo) with a long nave. Carlo Maderno, by
adding the nave and western facade, dis-
guised the scale of the church from the out-
side: Close to the facade, one cannot even see
the far-off dome. The church is seen in its 
parts, not as a whole.
  For a long time, people have accepted
Michelangelo's strictures on the Sangallo
model. Michelangelo had been frustrated by 
Sangallo's papal commissions, and he reject-
ed the plans for St. Peter's with contempt.
But scholarship devoted to the Sangallo
model during its restoration has uncovered
some forgotten merits of its design.
Michelangelo criticized the model for being
too dark in its interior. He said Rome's 
lowlifes would lurk in its dim crannies. But
Sangallo conceived it as a mausoleum, the
funerary monument for St. Peter, and he
angled 16 of his tunneled windows to throw
rays of light on the tomb area. The exteri-
or of the church he patterned after classical
mausoleums-~those of Augustus and
Hadrian. Like them, it had colonnades and 
tiered statues around the "mound" on top (a
low dome). Even the spires in front, criticized
as Gothic elements intruding upon a clas-
sical design, were taken from an Etruscan 
tomb (of Porsena) described by Pliny.
  Michelangelo's plan was also for a mau-
soleum, but of a very different sort. He 
began his work destined for St. Peter's 
under Pope Julius II, who wanted a huge 
funerary monument to himself. This
became one of Michelangelo's great doomed
projects, which not even his titanic energy

I BOUGHT AN UNDERWATER WATCH
in the gift shop of the Oceanographic Mu-
seum in Monte Carlo for 699 francs (about 
$132) in June 1993. After I returned home, I


wore it for the first time. The watch leaked,
so I sent it back to the museum via certified 
mail, along with the sales slip and the guar-
antee. I received the registered receipt 
about a week later, indicating that the
watch had arrived.
  I heard nothing, so I sent a follow-up let-
ter in December. Now, seven months later,
I have yet to get any response and would
appreciate your help.

In our opinion, Kerr should either have been
reimbursed or given a new watch. Ultimate-
ly, after several months of corresponding
with the museum, we were able to secure a 
full refund for him. When Ombudsman first
approached the museum last August, it said
that it had received a letter from Kerr about a 
problem with the watch but had not heard 
anything more. It maintained that the watch
had never been returned to the museum and
said that it would contact the director of the 
Monaco post office to try to trace the parcel.
At that point, it asked us for a copy of the re-
turn receipt, which we provided.
  A month later, the museum asked us for
more paperwork-~including the U.S. postal

fishing, living, dying. Now, a hundred years
after the Sepik's discovery, they're betwixt
and between. Realistically, they cannot
compete at this money-gathering game of
ours. Yet neither can they return to a life
without desire.

IT'S BEACH TIME: THE CULTURE
surfer's last reward.
  We fly to Madang on the north coast,
the most popular weekend getaway for ex-
patriates living in Port Moresby. But we 
find everybody sitting around the pool be-
cause there's not much of a beach here. We
go snorkeling at a famously pristine atoll,
but it's turbulent; hunks of driftwood keep
clunking us in the head. The most interest-
ing thing we see in Madang is a big, revved-
up crowd down at the shipping docks on a 
Sunday morning-~a thousand people wait-
ing for their fix, for the betel nut boat to ar-
rive from the Sepik.
  No worries. We just hop on another
plane and fly to New Guinea's out islands.
  Kavieng, the capital of New Ireland, has
a Caribbean feel: black men sitting around
on chunks of broken concrete passing the
time. We rent mountain bikes and cycle 
down the island. It would be a three-hun-
dred-mile ride if we kept going, and it's one
vast coconut jungle, with stilted houses
strung out along the way. The people are
magnificently pleased to see us. "Moning!"
they call out. "Moning!" Then a bit later:
"Apinun!" And it always comes out:
"Happy noon!" We stop at an empty beach
to have a picnic lunch. In three minutes we
are surrounded by twenty inquisitive boys.
The next day we get a boat ride to another
island, and some teenagers lead us,
unasked, to a secret grotto with a waterfall.
  New Ireland was first landed upon by
European sailors in the 1500s. But not
many outlanders have bothered to repeat
the experience. Last year, according to the
lady at the visitors bureau, the island suf-
fered only three hundred tourists.
  Still, we have been told about a place, the
Mansava Adventure Lodge, which is yet 
farther removed from ordinary reality. So
on our third morning in New Ireland a 
boatman named Graham picks us up and
takes us out into the Pacific, past many
other coral-fringed islands, an hour and a
half away by forty-horse outboard, to the
islet of Tsoi.
  Here is the beach we were looking for: the
kind of beach that could truly separate a
man from his cargo. The sand is as white as
piano keys and overhung by emerald coco
palms. The water's a radiant turquoise. A 
sister island basks across a silken channel. A 
beach, yes, that Lyndon Johnson could

national and world events. During 
the first two years of the study, the
researchers found that students
who watched Channel One did only
slightly (about 3 percent) better on
current-events tests than students
who did not. The researchers did
find "a consistent advantage" for
Channel One viewers in the third
year, when they focused only on
schools where the teachers made a 
special effort to integrate Channel 
One into class discussions. But 
even then, the gains were fairly
small: 5 percent for high school stu-
dents, and 8 percent for middle 
school students.

Schoolhouse as billboard
  Direct advertising, in which the
school itself becomes the medium,
has mushroomed in recent years, as
marketers come up with ever more
ingenious ways to tempt needy
school districts:
  ~ Some districts, hungry for 
funds, sell advertising space on the
sides of school buses. Other dis-
tricts might do the same if it weren't
for state restrictions. In California,
the Highway Patrol blocked the
Fremont Unified School District's 
plan for school-bus ads, arguing
that the buses had to be painted 
bright yellow for the sake of safety
and visibility.
  ~ By filling a school's hallways,
lobby, and lunchroom with rock
music and commercials, some ad-
ministrators bring in up to $20,000 a 
year in extra cash. That is the pitch 
used by Star Broadcasting of St. 
Paul, Minn., which is now broad-
casting Top 50 music and commer-
cials into 400 school cafeterias
across the country.

boards, in hallways and lunch 
rooms are a commonplace sight for

MUTUAL FUNDS


Big remodeling projects often start casually-the dishwasher breaks
down, and you notice the cabinets are looking old, or you're wiping
moisture from a foundation wall and decide it's time to refinish the
basement to add some living space to the house. But what starts almost
unintentionally just as often ends up with a homeowner who is feeling liter-
ally homicidal about contractors. To get the job done right, you've got to be
anything but casual, because this is one big "homework" assignment.
  First, unless you're a dedicated DIYer with a lot of free time, chances are
you're going to hire a contractor or designer. You'll find yourself alternating
between extremes-~happy anticipation of a beautiful new master bedroom
suite or a spacious new family room and dread about the horrific images
you've heard from friends: the ones about remodelers who disappeared
without finishing the roof. Or damaged the plumbing lines. Or messed up
the materials orders and then took six months to finish a one-month job.
  Unfortunately, any remodeling job, big or small, can turn into a genuine
nightmare of lies, recriminations, shoddy work, outrageous cost overruns
and even outright fraud. But it's not the typical scenario, and it certainly
doesn't have to happen to you. It's up to you to make sure it doesn't, and
you've got plenty of tools at hand to do so.
  Ultimately, you're going to make a very personal decision that will tem-
porarily disrupt your life. "We're camping out in your home," says Sandy
McAdams, CGR, vice president of the McAdams Co., a full-service residen-
tial remodeling contractor in Kirkland, Wash. McAdams is active in the
Remodelors~~ Council of the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB).
Because the working relationship will be fairly intimate, you want to be sure
you and the contractor are on the same wavelength. Cameron Snyder, CKD,
president of Kitchen Concepts, a kitchen/bath designer-dealer in Norwell,
Mass., calls it a "kind of synergy. Meet with the designer and ask yourself
'does this designer understand me?'," says Snyder, who is the incoming
president of the National Kitchen & Bath Association (NKBA).
  Responsible remodelers are well aware of their industry's image prob-
lems. It's to the industry's advantage to deliver a quality job on time, within
budget, and with a minimum of problems. "That will benefit me in the long
run," says Polly Evans, CR, CKD, president of Case Design/Remodeling, a 
full-service design/build company with offices in Falls Church, Va. and 
Bethesda, Md. "It means I satisfied you; you're going to be happy, and
you're going to recommend me," says Evans, who is also immediate past
president of the National Association of the Remodeling Industry (NARI).

ARMING YOURSELF WITH INFORMATION

In most remodeling jobs, you're concerned with both function and appear-
ance-~your goal at the end of the project is to have something that works
for you and looks terrific. But you've got to do your homework.
  Good information is your best resource and your best protection. It's
widely and readily available. Relevant government agencies, industry trade
associations, and manufacturers are all important sources of information on
permits and codes, hiring remodelers, products, and design ideas. (See
"Where to Find Help" below and the "Credentials" box.) Magazines are good
sources for checking out product features and design trends. Manufacturers 
offer consumer literature on their lines and how their products fit into the
projects you may be planning. Pricing information is available in books from
publishers like R.S. Means and Craftsman Book Company.
  Put in the research time, and you'll get a hands-on feel for the products
you'll be using. In the process, you'll learn enough to ask the right questions
and judge workmanship. You'll also get a good sense of what things cost.
This will help you sort out your budget and work out your financing before
you even start interviewing remodelers. You should be prepared from the 
start to discuss your cost range and budget limits.
  Depending on the job you're planning and where you live, you should 
also check out local building-code requirements. Additions to the structure,
plumbing and sewer-line connections, and electrical work are just some of
the elements that usually involve code compliance. Find out what the
requirements are, and who needs to obtain the permit-~this is usually
something you'll want your contractor to do.
  You'll also be making decisions about the professionals you need to
hire. Many designers and contractors do a mix of residential and commer-
cial work, but they tend to specialize in one or the other. Homeowners
should go with firms emphasizing residential, since they're likely to be more
familiar with the ins and outs of the home and its needs. And you'll reduce


the chance that they'll give priority to bigger, more demanding, and more
profitable commercial jobs.
  If your job involves space planning and interior design, you may want to
opt for professionals with those competencies. Room additions and large-
scale structural modifications that require blueprints and construction draw-
ings might require you to work with an architect.
  Jobs requiring design as well as construction and installation expertise
might call for a full-service design/build company. They handle jobs ranging
from garages to room additions to repaneling the library. Kitchen/bath
designers and dealers handle design and installation for those rooms, and
increasingly, for the other-room jobs many homeowners are now doing. If
you're doing insulation, electrical, plumbing or other non-design related
work, you should be looking at subcontractors and contractors in those spe-
cialties. This is likely to be the case with roofing and siding, as well.
  In addition to independent designers and contractors, you may want to 
touch base with some of the national home centers. They're adding indus-
try-certified people to their staffs and offering installation referrals as well.
  "Most dissatisfaction comes from poor planning," says Allen Inlow,
executive vice president of the National Association of Plumbing-Heating-
Cooling Contractors (NAPHCC), a contractor trade association. "If you can
sit down and talk with the contractor from the start, you can avoid delays 
and extra costs."
  Putting in this time and effort up-front can make the difference between 
happiness and misery, both while the job is going on and when it is finished.
But too few people follow through on the information. "This is a major
investment," Snyder says, "and consumers don't check enough."

CHOOSING YOUR REMODELER

Visit showrooms, home centers, and lumberyards while you're reviewing the
written material you'll be collecting. It's a good way to start talking with
designers and to see the products in person. Get remodelers' names from 
people who've gone through it-~friends, family, or business associates. 
Word-of-mouth is the best reference; contractors who get most of their
business this way are very likely the ones you'll want most to talk to. If you
don't know someone who's recently completed the kind of job you'll be 
doing, names from the professional associations and their local chapters are
a better bet than the phone book.
  If you've used remodelers before for other jobs, ask them to recom-
mend subcontractors and specialists in the project you're now planning.
Home centers and lumberyards are another source. They don't generally
recommend individual contractors, but they do have lists, and they're not
going to recommend people they haven't checked out. You might also try
driving through your neighborhood and looking for contractor names on
signs in front of homes with current jobs underway.
  If the same names keep coming up, or if certain remodelers get espe-
cially strong recommendations, they're the ones to interview first. Right
from the start, reject anyone who shows up for a first visit in dirty work
boots and a messy truck. High-pressure sales tactics are another turn-off,
along with any problems in verifying the contractor's street address, license
number or insurance.
  Check The Remodeler's Background. In addition, be sure you get sat-
isfactory answers to several important questions. Is the contractor in com-
pliance with existing licensing requirements for his or her trade? Does he or
she carry general liability insurance and workers' comp? These factor into
the kind of protection you have if the job isn't completed or if there's an acci-
dent while work is underway.
  A good remodeler will have his or her license numbers and insurance 
certificates ready to show you and will be happy to have you verify them.
"Anybody reputable would want you to check everything," Snyder says. At
least 38 states now have laws requiring contractors and/or designers to be
licensed. Many localities have their own requirements, regardless of state-
level laws. Take the time to see what kind of licensing your state or town 
has, and you'll be aware of what protection it may afford you and how
strongly officials enforce it.
  In some jurisdictions, contractors can get a license just by paying a fee
or registering. Others states or areas require examinations, demonstrations
of financial stability, and/or proof of insurance and workers'-comp coverage.
Some licensing laws have restitution funds and provisions for compensating 
consumers who can show proof of failure to complete the job. "You have to

must give you written notice that you have three days to cancel
a signed contract without penalty. If the contractor fails to pro-
vide you with this notification, take it as a deal-breaking warning
sign and look for a new contractor.
  Think through all the things related to the job, as well as the
work you set out to do. It will cost less to do it all at once than
to come back a year later and add it on. "Do the homework,"
Cameron Snyder says. In the kitchen, "Look for cabinets you 
like." Don't just think cooktop, for example, he continues-~
think "four or six-burner cooktop. Come up with a wish list of 
everything you've always wanted in your kitchen. Then priori-
tize your list."
  Talking to a contractor about a driveway? Discuss the kind 
of base you'll use, Evans says. On exterior jobs like siding and
roofing, McAdams says, make sure the materials are visually
compatible with the house. Such jobs are also the right time to
upgrade your insulation, she adds.
  A bathroom remodel might be the time to inspect all your
home's plumbing, suggests Inlow. "Ask the contractor to take 
a look at the pipes." Over the years, galvanized steel and other
piping used in older homes run a serious risk of developing 
clogged arteries from sediment deposits and narrowing of the 
channel, he notes.


DEVELOPING A REALISTIC BUDGET

Getting ready and on the job, working with the designer or
contractor calls for regular, two-way communication-~and
two-way trust. "Once you've made the decision to hire a con-
tractor, I'd hope you'd trust that decision and have confidence 
in the person you've hired," McAdams says. "We want to hear 
what you expect from us."
  That begins with cost questions. "The budget is the first 
thing to zero in on-~for any job," Evans says. "You have to
be able to tell the person you're working with how much you 
plan to spend." Expect that to be one of the designer's first
questions. Remodelers are well aware that it's one that
makes consumers nervous. "A lot of customers will be reluc-
tant to give it because they think the designer will spend it 
all," Snyder acknowledges. But, "A good firm will request a 
budget figure. The design for a $30,000 job will be different 
from a design for a $10,000 job," he notes.


  Your budget is the starting point for discussions about balancing design
choices and deciding on product selection. "I not only need your budget, but
I need your list of priorities," Polly Evans says. "That's how I can specify
quality products to give you as much of your wish list as I can."
  Snyder emphasizes that "It's the designer's responsibility to draw infor-
mation from the customer that the customer might not even think is impor-
tant. Consumers should expect a lot of time and a lot of meetings." Typically
in a kitchen job, the designer will explain your product choices, going over
differences in materials and pricing. "He should make design recommenda-
tions and lighting recommendations," Snyder says, adding that key details
like lighting are something consumers tend to overlook.
  Up front, says McAdams, "If the contractor is doing his job, he will let
you know the unexpected can happen." Contractors should also be very
clear on what they need from you, and on what schedule. If you're going to
be choosing materials like wallpaper or deciding on whether to include insu-
lation in a siding job, he or she should set up a reasonable schedule that
gives you time to make your choices.
  Your part in this is just as important. If you're going to buy some of the
products used in a kitchen remodel on your own, for example, tell the per-
son you're hiring. Make sure the designer knows of any strong preferences
you may have about the way things will work or how they will look.
  Remember: Something will go wrong during the job. You can bet on it.
The cabinets won't arrive on time. Or there'll be termites in the wall where
you're putting on a room addition. You might decide when you see it going
in that you can't stand the range hood you chose. Whatever it is, if you've 
taken the time to protect yourself and put the right measures in place, it 
shouldn't become a major crisis. That's the bottom line.

WHERE TO FIND HELP

Consumer awareness is a fundamental concern of professional construction
and design trade associations today. There's no way to list them all; we've
included some of the most useful, either because of their residential orienta-
tions or because of the specialties involved.
  Write to the following addresses or call the phone numbers, and you'll
literally be flooded with information. You'll get lists of member contractors

  Perhaps the next-greatest impact on 
the resale value of a used car or truck is
the current cost of a new version of the
same or a similar vehicle. One way to
ensure a good resale value is to "buy a
vehicle in a class where prices will rise
dramatically in the future," says George
Peterson, automotive analyst and presi-
dent of Auto Pacific Group Inc. When
new-car prices are on the upswing, it
helps prop up the values of used vehi-
cles. Strong market demand, coupled

Six Flags Houston, guests enter an eerie 
Gotham City movie set including the 
Batcave, Arctic Park and Cold Storage.
Then they board a coaster that whips 
them through a 360-degree loop and a 
tunnel with special visual effects. This
park has nine other coasters, including
the new indoor Mayan Mindbender
enclosed in "an ancient temple."
  Other parks emphasize showtime. At
Opryland USA in Nashville, Tenn., you 
can wander among a string of auditori-
ums and outdoor pavilions that feature 
everything from country music and
Broadway revues to heartfelt gospel
music, then attend a performance of the
Grand Ole Opry next door and go for a 
dinner cruise on the General Jackson
showboat (yes, with yet another show).
"Paramount on Ice Legends" at
Paramount's Kings Island, near
Cincinnati, combines live skating action
with motion-picture oldies. At Knott's
Camp Snoopy, the indoor theme park in
the Mall of America, Bloomington,
Minn., guests can attend musical revues
at the Playhouse Theater, a Wilderness
Wildlife Show and music shows on the 
Northwood Stage-~all in a landscaped 
setting with 400 trees and 30,000 plants
that recreate Minnesota's North Woods.


as adults. Others use height, charging
every child 48 inches or taller the full
adult price.
  But there are ways to reduce your 
costs. "Anyone who pays full admission
at a park today has money to burn," says
one park marketing executive, speaking 
off the record. "Most parks have to offer
coupons or other discount deals to keep
people coming through those turnstyles,
especially during slow periods." Here
are a few of the deals out there:
  Going to the park for two or more
days? Most parks offer discounts for 
consecutive-day tickets-~or lower-
priced dual-tickets if they are associated
with a water park or other attraction. For
frequent visitors, a season pass can be a 
great moneysaver. Almost all parks offer
discounts to seniors. Many offer dis-
counts to active and retired military per-
sonnel and their families, handicapped 
visitors, teachers, students, members of
various organizations including AARP
(American Association of Retired 
Persons), other senior organizations,
AAA (the American Automobile
Association), motor and travel clubs,
local residents who live in certain zip-
code areas in cities around the park,
teachers, community groups-~to name 
just a few. To claim these discounts you
often must follow certain procedures set
by the individual parks, such as showing
appropriate identification or getting

the desired final result.

OPERATING ON NESTED
RELATIONS
If relation R has a column C that con-
tains numbers, I can apply opera-
tors such as "+," "-," "<," and so
on to values from that column. It's 
important to understand, however,
that-~conceptually, at least-~the
DBMS doesn't know what it means,
for example, to add two numbers
together; what it does know is how
to invoke a built-in function called
"+" that can perform that operation
on its behalf.
  In exactly the same way, if re-
lation R has a column C that con-
tains relations, I can apply opera-
tors to values from that column, and
the DBMS will simply invoke the 
appropriate built-in functions to
perform the requested operations.
But the operators that I want to ap-
ply to values in that column are
(of course) things such as restrict,
project, and so on.... In other words,
"invoking the appropriate built-in
functions" will effectively be just a 
recursive call on (certain portions of)
the DBMS itself.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
Well, I've now introduced the basic
idea of nested relations and shown
how they can be used to avoid the
need for outer join. Next month, I'll
consider other applications of the


nested relation idea. For now, let me
leave you with this month's "puzzle
corner" problem. I mentioned earlier 
that "NF2 relations" require explicit 
NEST and UNNEST operations for con-
verting between a relation's nested 
and unnested forms. In outline, those
operators work as follows:
  ~ Given a relation and a set
of columns, NEST returns a corre-
sponding nested relation. For ex-
ample, nesting the usual suppliers
relation "along" S#, SNAME, and STA-
TUS yields a nested relation contain-
ing three rows, one for each of the 
three CITY values (London, Paris, and
Athens); each of these rows con-
tains the appropriate city name and 


a relation with heading { S#, SNAME,
STATUS }, representing the suppliers 
in that city. Note: It might help to 
point out that if we partition the
columns of relation R into two dis-
joint subsets A and B, nesting R
along B is equivalent to grouping R
by A.
  ~ UNNEST is the opposite of NEST,
loosely speaking-~though if we un-
nest R "along" some set of columns
and then nest the result "along" 
those same columns again, we don't 
necessarily get back to R!
  Give an example to show that
-~as just indicated-~unnesting in 
this sense isn't necessarily reversible.
Can you find a set of conditions 
under which the unnesting is nec-
essarily reversible?  ~~~~

functions and minimize their pro-
cessing. Variants of this principle are
the "80/20 rule" (focus on that 20
percent of the problem that will re-
turn 80 percent of the benefits) and
the "bottleneck rule" (always work
on the biggest bottleneck). When 
we are designing software, this prin-
ciple reminds us to focus our de-
sign efforts on the most perfor-
mance-critical components of the 
highest priority, highest volume, 
most performance-critical applica-
tions. This rule is particularly useful
in a distributed environment, since
we have more components to think
about.
  When applying this rule to
tuning a distributed system, the prob-
lem lies in finding out where the
largest bottleneck is-~a topic we'll 
discuss later when we address the
Instrumentation Principle. But the
Centering Principle also reminds us
that we must first know which appli-
cations are performance critical and
which system components will be the
most heavily exercised. To answer
these questions, we should make
sure we collect this information dur-
ing the planning and analysis stages 
of the development process. Then, 
performance modeling techniques 
can help us identify critical applica-
tion and system components.
  If we don't apply the Center-
ing Principle to everything we do, 
we could waste a lot of effort re-
fining the design of components
that are rarely used or not perfor-
mance critical.

THE THIRD PRINCI-
ple is the Workload
Principle: Minimize 
the total processing
load. This universal
performance principle is so obvi-
ous that we tend to forget about it.
Another name for it might be "the


shouldn't stop with function; they
should also record the relationship 
of the application's different com-
ponents to business variables such
as the number of customers need-
ing certain types of service and the
expected frequencies of these busi-
ness activities. Unless we capture 
these kinds of metrics during anal-
ysis, we can't expect to make in-
formed design decisions later in the
development process.

THE FOURTH PRIN-
ciple is the Locality
Principle: Optimize
the distribution of
work. Smith's princi-
ple states, "Create actions, functions,
and results that are 'close' to phys-
ical resources"; Shasha's "render
onto server what is due onto serv-
er" embodies the same thought. The
point is that we will receive the best
performance when the physical 
computing resources are closely 
matched to the logical processing
needs. We shouldn't take this prin-
ciple as an argument against logi-
cal design; rather, it's an argument
against implementing a logical de-
sign without regard for the phys-
ical consequences.
  Locality is a key aspect of dis-
tributed design. Smith discusses four
types of locality: spatial (closeness
in distance), temporal (closeness in
time), effectual (closeness in pur-
pose), and degree (closeness in ca-
pacity); all four apply to the design
of client systems. For example, the 
locality principle tells us to:
  ~ Perform all user interface 
logic on the client workstation
(spatial)
  ~ Store procedures for stan-
dard database processing with the
data they manipulate (spatial)
  ~ Use systematic data repli-
cation schemes to distribute appro-
priately organized data closer to its
users (spatial)
  ~ Avoid applications that as-
semble their data at execution time
from databases at separate locations
(temporal)
  ~ Use dedicated servers when
application performance is critical
(effectual)
  ~ Analyze projected demand 
to size server and disk capacity needs
(degree).
  Perhaps the single-most in-
fluential factor in a distributed ap-

evant by the object's creator-~and
only those characteristics. For this 
reason, a business object is also an
abstraction or "distillation" of the
essential characteristics of the thing
it represents.
  All data, procedures, and con-
straints that are part of an object
must be related to the central con-
cept the object represents. Every-
thing an object knows is represent-
ed in its data. Everything an object
does is performed by its procedures.
A business object's data is only 
accessible to the outside world 
through the object's procedures. The 
outside world does not even know 
how the methods themselves are
implemented. This process is known
as encapsulation, which is one of
the more important (and most mis-
understood) characteristics of 
objects.
  Encapsulation enforces pro-
cess and data integrity. Consider
the difference between a data table
accessed by 20 different programs 
and SQL queries and a business 
object being accessed by the same 
20 "clients." The table's data is com-
pletely open to interpretation by 
each program and query. Business 
rules and integrity constraints are
enforced by the client, not the ta-
ble. True, part of this problem lies
with RDBMS implementations, but
the relational model itself is not
behavior-based. The relational 
model deals with normalization of
data, not data and process and con-
straints. Furthermore, while sub-
routine libraries, design reviews,
and production controls could theo-
retically mitigate data and process
integrity problems, in reality these
problems continue to grow. Data
tables and subroutines do not pro-
vide sufficient encapsulation to
hide differences in application re-
quirements, cross-organization per-
spectives, data location, and het-
erogeneous hosting, and the reality
of a development process where 
applications-development groups 
define the process. Process and
data integrity problems cannot be
corrected as long as "data people"
and "process people" argue over
the data structures and semantics.
Business objects provide a mecha-
nism for integrating and normaliz-
ing business data, procedures, and 
constraints into manageable pack-
ages. As we will see, these pack-


  Roles are like parts in a theat-
rical play. Actors take on roles, or
parts, in the play. A given actor
may take on more than one role 
during the course of a play. The 
role is not the actor, but the actor
takes on the properties of the role
while in the part. Object roles work
in much the same way: A business 
object can take on different roles
for different purposes; however
unlike an actor, an object can take
on more than one role at one time!
In this sense, roles are not exclu-
sive (for example, given object A
with roles B and C, A can play B or
C, but A can play B and C simulta-
neously as well). Note another dif-
ference between types and roles: A
type alters what an object is, while 
a role masks what the object is.
With roles, the underlying object
remains unchanged. A common ex-
ample of roles will help: Custom-
er, vendor, and employee are roles
played by a business object known
as party (such as a legal party, in-
volved party, or legal entity). Be-
cause a role looks the same as a 
business object, we universally re-
fer to roles and the "underlying"
business object as business objects.
Why? Because from the viewpoint 
of someone interacting with the
role, the object has become the 
role!
  In short, an object presents a
clearly defined interface or proto-
col by which outsiders may use its
services. To get work done by or 
request data from a business ob-
ject, you must know how to identi-
fy the object, what to ask for, and 
how to phrase the request.

OBJECTS AND ENTITIES
In several respects, objects have a
similar "feel" to concepts like enti-
ties, tables, and domains:
  ~ All (at least when well de-
fined) represent some aspect(s) of 
a business concept.
  ~ All contain information or
data in some form.
  ~ There could be a 1:1 map-
ping among the domain of an enti-
ty, a table, and a business object.
  ~ Asking an object for data is
similar in concept to using SQL on
an RDBMS: You must identify the
data source (the database and ta-
ble), know what to ask for (the col-
umn names), and how to phrase 
the request (the ordering, selection,

to create a graphic representation
of the existing database design.

5. Quality Graphics Presentations
Silverrun supports standard Win-
dows graphics-display properties.
The analyst can specify color for an
individual symbol, which can vary
for the outline, text, and background.
Fonts are defined by symbol type.
  The analyst can select which
name to display for entities: full
name, coded name, or alias. Attri-
bute data type and lengths aren't
displayable. Relationship arc names
correspond to verb phrases in the
binary modeling approach. The
product will display these names,
but they must be unique for each
entity. I found it difficult to come up
with different a verb statement for
each of the arcs emanating from the
same entity when the relationships 
represented very similar roles.
  The analyst can select which
process properties are displayed on


a DFD, as well as add timestamps 
and free-form text to the diagrams.

6. Ease of Use
In general, I found Silverrun very
easy to use. Its approach to modeling
is very compatible with my own. It
conforms to the majority of the Win-
dows diagramming standards, such
as sizing, symbol movement, and 
rubberband selection. However, it
doesn't support alignment, back-to-
front, and symbol grouping.
  Excellent, easy-to-read docu-
mentation accompanies Silverrun.
Tutorials are also easy to follow, 
which is fortuitous-~I found the 
tutorials essential in learning the 
Silverrun methodology. Many of
Silverrun's modeling techniques 
use different terminology for con-
cepts with which we are already 
familiar. The index is defined in 
these terms, so until you get up to
speed in the Silverrun vocabulary,
much of it is similar to switching 


from French to Italian. You can
discern what a lot of the terms mean
because of their similarity to the
original language, but a learning
curve is involved.
  Help facilities for the product
are, for all practical purposes, un-
available. Hitting F1 doesn't work.
Selecting the help menu bar options 
only provides a cryptic overview of
the toolbar functions. However, the
help facilities provided through the
expert functions in ERX are excel-
lent. They provide a description of
the anomaly detected, with examples 
to assist the analyst in understand-
ing the issue. Alternate tactics for re-
solving the issue are provided. For 
example, alternatives for selecting an
identifier are "generate," which cre-
ates a surrogate identifier, or select-
ing from the available attributes and 
relationships. In all cases, a "post-
pone decision" option is provided.
  The connection/relationship
lines track incredibly well. The lines

  Note that with thr_create you can no
longer rely on your stack to autogrow.
The kernel supports autogrowth of a
stack when you run out of stack space,
but since the kernel isn't handling 
threads, it doesn't know anything about
the threads' stacks. Thus, you have to al-
locate a big-enough stack right from the 
thr_create call.

Threads and Signals
You can set up separate signal masks for
each thread in a process. A signal sent
to a UNIX process from another UNIX 
process via kill(process_id,signal_id),
however, will only go to a thread enabled
to catch that signal. If more than one
thread is accepting a particular signal, the
signal may be delivered to any accept-
ing thread.
  For this and other reasons, Novell rec-


ommends that instead of dealing with sig-
nals on a thread-by-thread basis, appli-
cations mask all signals in all threads and
dedicate a single thread to wait on in-
coming signals via sigwait. An "object
thread" program that adds a signal han-
dler thread to Listing One is available elec-
tronically (see "Availability," page 3). As
always, it pays to build an appropriately 
limited signal set. Two new signals have
been defined in UW 2.0 to support the
threads lib, SIGWAITING and SIGLWP.
SIGWAITING happens when all LWPs in 
the processes' LWP pool are blocked in-
terruptibly. In thread8, this occurs when 
thread 1 is in gets(), thread 2 is sitting in
a sigwait(), and all the other threads are
either suspended or sleeping. If you add
SIGWAITING to an object-thread pro-
gram's signal set, the process will stop ac-
cepting user input.

EXTENDED STATE


ESD). It also has a public function, BS_
Fire(), which executes a transition from 
one state to the following state within that
class, much like the C function call de-
scribed in my previous article. However, 
before the child's BS_Fire() function fires,
it calls the parent's BS_Fire(), thereby al-
lowing the parent controllers to traverse 
their own internal transitions.
  Similarly, a controller starts up in its de-
fault state (for example, the Idle state in 
Figure 3) using its class constructor to set
up the initial states. Again, the child's con-
structor calls its parent's constructors be-
fore it actually executes its own con-
structor. A special set of public functions,
denoted as BS_in_St_xxx_Py() (where
xxx is a state name and y is a page num-
ber) is available for sensing the state of a
parent class from its children. In Figure 3,
for example, the controller actually starts
its activity only sensing that base1 (Figure 
1) has moved to the Red2Main state. It 
aborts its activities and moves back to the
Idle state when it senses that base1 has
moved out of Red2Main. Similarly, it sens-
es whether base2 (Figure 2) has detected 
a Car or a Truck. (Visual priorities were
discussed in the previous article.) The two
transitions in Figure 3-~one from Car2
to Car3, and the other from Cars to Cam-
era_Shoot-~might fire simultaneously,

  Together C++ opens with four win-
dows. You diagram your model in the
object-model window; see Figure 3. The
other three windows contain the classes 
in your diagram, subjects, and graphical
views of your project. The exciting fea-
ture is that if you type in the code in the
editor window, the diagram window will
be updated and vice versa. Your code and 
diagram always reflect each other. You 
create a Class-Object either by clicking
on the right mouse button and selecting 
class or subject from a pop-up menu or
by clicking on the Class-Object icon in
the floating toolbar. Together C++ will
prompt you for the name of the Class-
Object and generate the .hpp and .cpp
files. Together C++ arranges the symbols
within the object-model window; you can 
override this feature by switching to man-
ual or semi-automatic. In semi-automatic
mode, you arrange the symbols and To-
gether C++ arranges the relationship con-
nections. In manual mode, you handle 
arranging the symbols and the placement 
of their connections. Manual mode also
allows you to show the class multiplici-
ties (one-to-many or one-to-one rela-
tionships between Whole/Part classes) for
every class on the diagram. The other

HEALTH & SAFETY


Some of us are more susceptible than
others, and a blessed few never get
seasick at all. If you don't have any ex-
perience to go by, it is wise to assume
that you will have some adverse reac-
tion to the boat's motion, and you
should be prepared for it.
  It is important to recognize that sea-
sickness is a syndrome, that is, a con-
stellation of equally important physical 
and psychological symptoms. The sea-
sick fisherman feels physically lousy,
overcome by nausea, headache, weak-
ness, and disorientation. He or she can
also feel useless, helpless, guilty, and 
uncaring. Fortunately, seasickness


days prior to your trip, avoid eating
large amounts of heavy and difficult-
to-digest foods such as meat and 
cheese. Stick to fruit, carbohydrates,
and leafy vegetables. Don't go out
drinking the night before. A hang-
over-~even a mild one-~will only make
matters worse. Fatigue and anxiety
also increase the effects of motion dis-
comfort. Get plenty of sleep, and al-
low yourself enough time for planning 
and travel.
  From the moment you board the
boat, stay busy and involved in the
things going on around you. Follow
your progress on the chart, check your


ScopTM. The patch is placed behind 
the ear several hours before you go to
sea and the medication is absorbed 
through the skin. This is a very effec-
tive way to reduce the symptoms of
seasickness, but it can cause some un-
pleasant side effects, such as visual dis-
turbances, drowsiness, and confusion.
Scopolamine should be used only after 
discussion with your medical practi-
tioner. Often, using only half a patch
will provide significant relief without
noticeable side effects.
  One drug combination that is par-
ticularly successful at offsetting sea-
sickness is promethazine (Phenergan)
as I lifted it out of the water. So I flopped it back in and be-
gan making figure-eight half circles with the rod tip beside
the boat, working the flashing spinner toward the nearest
stump. Bass hate seeing a goody get away by crawling up on
something, and this fish made a major commotion grabbing
the lure when it got a second chance.
  Clunn seemed impressed.
  "I've heard all my life about teasing a bass back into strik-
ing again," he said seriously, "but that's the first time I ever
saw it work well enough to make me think it might be
worth the time. How'd you know the fish was going to still
be there? You think it's a better percentage play than just
making another cast to a new spot?"
  I had to laugh. Here was one of the world's best bass fish-
ermen-~one of the biggest money winners in professional
bass fishing history-~and he's asking me?
  "There's always something to be learned," he said. "I used 
to follow your columns in the Houston Chronicle when I was
first learning to fish. Some of the things you wrote about


wading up behind me one early spring afternoon in 1942,
and I didn't even hear him. Pearl Harbor had happened a
few months before, and I was worrying that my dad might
have to go to war. There were to be no more reels for the
duration, nor shotgun shells, but lots of other things were
troubling me then, such as how humans could be smart 
enough to invent algebra, but still couldn't cure acne.
Fourteen was starting out as a big year for getting turned 
down by both girls and bass.
  The whir of Jess's reel brought me back to reality, and the
first thing I noticed about his casting was that he was doing 
it wrong. Next thing I noticed was that he was catching a 
bass out of the very same brushpile I'd been fruitlessly cast-
ing to for half an hour.


  I couldn't believe it. I'd seen that fish swirling around,
probably making a nest, but when I had dropped a plug
anywhere close she'd streaked off for deeper water. I was
casting exactly the way the outdoor magazine writers said
to in those days, starting with the lure reeled up almost to
the rod tip, then coming back fast with the rod and then
forward twice as fast, with my elbow down as if I were
holding an egg against my side. This was supposed to make
the rod tip do the work. My casts just kept draping over
limbs, and I blamed it on my solid-steel rod, an ancient
product of the American Fork & Hoe Company, which
had all the action of a pitchfork.
  Jess was using a short, stiff little rod, too, except he was
letting his lure dangle about a foot below the rod tip and
giving it a sort of semicircular swoosh, like whirling a
sling underhand.


low over the water and throw sidearm. The lower you start
the plug, the shorter its fall and the less splash it makes. If
you wrap a limb, don't just reel the plug up to the problem
and snag it. Give it slack until it's a foot or two below the
limb, make a light pull with the rod to get it started 
swinging, and yank it over."
  He walked on down the shoreline making those looping
casts, raising the rod just as the plug touched the water to
start it swimming back with scarcely a ripple. Right away
something grabbed it, spinning his reel handles backward
and taking line. It was a big freshwater drum, a species
I'd never seen caught on an artificial lure. Then he 
hooked a huge grindle (a bowfin to you non-Texans)
that literally tore up the slough and (Continued on page 108)


~ The sport of turkey hunting is 
growing rapidly in Idaho, thanks to
an ongoing transplanting program.
State upland-bird managers expect a 
record spring harvest this year.
  Idaho spring turkey hunters are
now harvesting gobblers at a rate of
about 500 birds a year, with 70 per-
cent of those bagged in the general-
season hunt (usually mid-April
through the first week of May) and
the rest in limited-entry hunts. Idaho
now sells more than 2,000  turkey
hunting tags each spring.
  Merriam's turkeys from Colorado
were first introduced to Idaho in
1961 near Riggins when seventeen
birds were released. Since then, the
Idaho Department of Fish and
Game has introduced 3,300 turkeys
(some of them Rio Grande-strain
birds), including 1,726 from 1991
through 1994.
  Tom Hemker, the department's 
upland-gamebird manager, recom-
mends that hunters obtain the
brochure, "Wild Turkey Hunting in
Idaho," available at all department
offices. The brochure covers areas 
where turkeys are found, their biolo-
gy, tips for identification, and other

of durability. Most "super light" reels
turned green and seized within two zip
codes of saltwater (even freshwater plug-
gers deserve corrosion-resistant tackle).
Shaving an ounce or two off a reel's
weight sounds impressive, but it doesn't
make much difference in the long run,
since most standard-size casting reels 
weigh only between 9 and 10 ounces, a 
comfortable payload in most hands.
  In defense of the tackle industry, it
should be pointed out that the era of
cheap window dressing occurred during
the peak of popularity of such classics as

Eagle Hangar is dedicated to the aircraft
and crews of World War II. Aluminum
Overcast has emerged from the Eagle
Hangar and is touring the country to
mark the 50th anniversary of the end
of the war.
The EAA is most famous for its annual
convention at Oshkosh, the biggest
aviation event in the world. But the 
EAA is much more than a seven-day
convention. Its Air Adventure Museum 
is open year-round, displaying aircraft
ranging from an exact replica of the
first Wright Brothers airplane to mod-
ern homebuilts. In the summer, Pioneer
Airport adjacent to the museum recre-
ates the golden age of aviation with
antique and classic airplanes flying 
from its sod runway. The winner of our
contest will get to spend a day around 
the fabulous airplanes of the museum
and Pioneer Airport as well as taking
the once-in-a-lifetime flight in the B-17.
  Aluminum Overcast, a G model, was
built by Lockheed (then called Vega)
under a Boeing license in 1945. It was
delivered to the Army Air Force on May
18, as the end of the war was in sight, so it
went directly into storage. The airplane 
was sold as surplus and passed through 
many hands. It hauled freight, worked as
an aerial sprayer and photo-mapped virtu-
ally all of the countries of the Middle East.
It was saved from destruction in 1978
when warbird enthusiast Dr. Bill Harri-
son, of Tulsa, Oklahoma, bought it and
donated it to the EAA Museum in 1981.
  The airplane had suffered a number
of indignities during its lifetime but the
restoration experts have healed almost 
every wound, making Aluminum Over-


cast one of the most complete B-17s fly-
ing. The radio compartment, bomb
bay area, waist guns, turrets and other
parts of the airplane that were removed
or modified for cargo and aerial photo
work have all been restored. The guns 
are back in place and the cockpit-~
except for the avionics necessary to
function in today's air traffic control sys-
tem-~is faithful to the World War II era.
The airplane is painted in the markings 
of the 398th Bomb Group and dupli-
cates the appearance of a B-17G, serial
number 42-85740, that was shot down
over France on August 13, 1944, while 
flying its 34th combat mission.
  The B-17 first flew in 1935 and first
deliveries were made to the Army in
1939. The early models had smaller 
caliber and fewer guns than the E mod-
el that went into mass production at
Boeing, Douglas and Vega in 1941. The
G model was the last produced in large
numbers, though the airplane flew spe-
cial missions under many designations.
More than 12,000 B-17s of all models 
were built.
  The B-17 had an airspeed redline of
305 mph, but typically cruised between
160 and 200 mph. Service ceiling was
35,000 feet and typical combat range
was around 1,100 miles. Range, with
extra fuel tanks, could be stretched to
nearly 2,000 miles. A crew of 10 was
typical on B-17 combat missions. The
airplane was protected by as many as
13 .50 caliber machine guns. Typical
bomb load was 6,000 pounds.
  Only a handful of B-17s remain in fly-
ing condition, and those are threatened 
by corrosion. Aluminum Overcast, with

transportation, two nights' stay double occupancy at
the Pioneer Inn and Resort, and allowance for meals,
including a dinner cruise on the Pioneer Princess. The
winner will fly in a pilot's seat of the Experimental 
Aircraft Association's (EAA) B-17, and the winner's 
companion can ride in a non-pilot seat. The duration
and route of the flight will be at the discretion of the 
EAA, which has complete control of the operation of
the aircraft. If poor weather or mechanical failure
make it impossible to conduct the flight, in the sole
judgment of the EAA, no substitute for the flight will be
awarded. The winner will also receive from the EAA a 
B-17 jacket; silk flying scarf; Pioneer Airport T-shirt
and hat; souvenir photo keepsake. Winner and com-
panion will receive an air tour of the EAA facility in a
Bell 47 helicopter (weather permitting). Total estimat-
ed retail value: $550. Any taxes are the responsibility
of the winner.
  The winner will be notified by phone and mail, and will
be required to sign an affidavit of eligibility and release
of liability for both HFM and EAA. The companion will
also be required to execute a release of liability (if
under age 18, a parent or guardian must sign). Failure
to return the affidavit within 10 days will result in an
alternate winner being selected. The winner need not
be a licensed pilot. Odds of winning will depend
on the number of entries received. The prize is not
transferable and there is no substitute for the prize.
  The contest is open to legal residents of the conti-
nental U.S., Alaska and Canada, except the Province
of Quebec, who are at least 21 years of age (except 
employees of HFM, EAA and their families, affiliates,
or advertising and promotion agencies). Void where
prohibited or restricted by law.

bearing to the station is 66, the reciprocal.
If you are outbound and it shows less
than that, you need to make a correc-
tion to the right to make the number in-
crease. If it's more, you need a correc-
tion to the left. That isn't as complicated
as it sounds but it is something that 
should be practiced.
  The GPS 95 XL also has a map func-
tion that will show the runway as you
approach it. Maybe someday, but for now
this pilot isn't ready to use an electronic 
map when sniffing for asphalt.
  The GPS gives distance to the airport
but it is to the airport reference point 
(usually in the middle of the field), unless
the GPS has the database for approach-
es. Then the end of the runway would
be included.
  The portable has the same level of ac-
curacy as my approach-approved GPS
155, which also has an internal battery
that will keep it going for a while after
an electrical failure. No way, though,
that I'd use the portable for approach
guidance other than in an emergency. It
doesn't have the built-in internal moni-
tors that warn if accuracy is degraded to
below approach standards. Also, in an
emergency I'd only fly a published 
NDB or VOR approach, following the
minimum published altitudes. You can
just overlay those for a GPS, as the FAA
is doing for approved systems.
  After flying both GPS systems on par-
tial panel I found the portable simpler to
use for approaches than the approach-
approved version.
  This portion of my refresher was de-
voted entirely to partial panel and the 
interface with both GPS systems. The
quick update on the track being made 
good is, simply, worth its weight in gold.
The standby value of a battery-powered
portable GPS to any instrument pilot 
is great. Maybe it is a fun toy but it can
also handle the serious business of
helping you find an airport in time of
need. It was also interesting to get a
partial panel workout. That's some-
thing I hope never again happens for
real, but it could.
  Where pilots of turboprops and jets
get to do all manner of scary and hairy
things in the simulators, there's too
much risk to trying a lot of that in an
airplane. For refreshers, though, we
can probe at the things we don't do
often so we'll be prepared if the time
comes. Do always get an instrument 
flight instructor to go with you. ~

READERS SAY


Rotten apples
SIR: Re "Apple for the teacher" (Apr.
24). Your article on teachers' salaries
was a travesty. While I deplore NEA
manipulations, comparing teachers' 
salaries and "wage earners'" is hardly
a valid comparison. How much col-
lege does the shipping clerk, factory
foreman or electronic assembler have?
Usually little or none, while a teacher
with a few years' service probably has a 
master's degree. Please, oh please, try
to think more like intelligent people
than politicians.
-ROBERT W. DINGMAN
Westlake Village, Calif.


SIR: No, I am not a teacher, however I
find it unusual that our society that is
dependent on having an educated
populace is not committed to attract-
ing the best and brightest to the field
of education. Or is FORBES advocat-
ing other pursuits? Is athletics or en-
tertainment more important to our
society than education? If you believe
that teachers' salaries should be medi-
ocre, you can expect that the people 
attracted to be educators will be me-
diocre, and therefore you are certainly 
not encouraging expansion in your
market of future readers.
-REGINALD I. BERRY
Annandale, Va.

SIR: In reading your article I found
myself choking on the core. Would it
be such a terrible use of our money if
the average teaching salary was higher
than the average manufacturing 


wage? Please do not insult or impugn
the teaching profession by making it
appear that we are overpaid.
-E.M. GRAY
Dublin, Calif.

SIR: No school district pays a summer
vacation benefit. However, teachers
are allowed to prorate their ten-
month salary over a 12-month period.
In the summer, many teachers seek
employment in summer schools,
camps and community facilities and
continue to work with children. I
doubt that the two-month summer
vacation will ever be eliminated. The
number of industries that depend fi-
nancially upon the increased summer
revenue generated by the families of
school children is too considerable.
-WAYNE T. WENDEL
Princeton, N.J.

SIR: As a teacher in the West Chester,
Pa. School District, my final paycheck
is the last day of school in June, and I 
don't see another until the second 
week in September. That's called un-
employment, not a vacation.

West Chester, Pa.

Don't bank on it
SIR: Re "Banking pops up in the
strangest places" (Apr. 10). The eu-
phoria over banks may be premature if
not entirely unwarranted. Banking is
not an income driven business but a 
reserve driven business. Most banks
currently have reserves at 1% to 2% of
total loans, which is far too low. Banks
ought to increase the reserves for bad
debts to at least 5% of total loans.
Recently banks have boosted earnings
by writing down their reserves while
their loan portfolios have grown. This
could be a formula for disaster if the
economy sours and nonperforming
assets start to rise.

SIR: Re "Russia-on-the-Pacific"

you really think it is that bad? What

Slot machines are illegal in California,
but the state's American Indians have figured out
a way to operate 8,000 of them.
Two-armed
bandits


By Nina Munk


TWO MONTHS AGO Jerald Sherred was
driving a rental truck east on Califor-
nia Interstate 10 when four police
cars, sirens blazing, pulled him over.
"I never saw so many lights," muses 
Sherred, a 66-year-old pig farmer
from Latah, Wash. "It looked like a 
parade."
  Unfortunately for Sherred, it was a
raid. The cops confiscated 29 slot
machines he was transporting to
Spotlight 29, an Indian-owned casino
just west of Palm Springs. Sherred 
pleaded guilty to possession of slot
machines, paid a $1,234 fine and
returned home to tend to his pigs.


  But the raid did nothing to slow
Spotlight 29's expansion. Since Sher-
red's arrest in March, the number of 
slot machines at the casino has in-
creased from 72 to 120. The ma-
chines are extremely lucrative because 
they attract masses of folks who
wouldn't otherwise gamble. Plus,
they require no workers to operate
them. Some 65% of total gaming reve-
nues in Nevada and Atlantic City,N.J.
come from slots.
  But, in California these machines
are illegal. "Slot machines are contra-
band, just like assault weapons or
marijuana," insists Thomas Gede, a 



California Special Assistant Attorney
General. Yet at least 20 Indian reser-
vations in the state operate slots in
their casinos.
  The number of illegal slot machines 
in the state has grown tenfold during
the past two years, to 8,000. The
largest such operation, Barona Big
Top Casino in Lakeside, Calif., on the 
Barona Indian Reservation, has 1,055
slot machines.
  The Indians can thumb their noses 
at Gede and other lawmen, thanks to
the 1987 landmark Supreme Court 
case, California v. Cabazon Band of
Mission Indians. The decision over-
turned the state's restrictions on bin-


Says Special Assistant Attorney
General Gede: "The state is barred
from enforcing its gambling code,
and the feds won't enforce it."
  Through this legal hole are slipping
some entrepreneurial characters.
Meet Ronald Clapper. California law-
men say Clapper, 34, owns a quarter
of the slot machines in California and
earns around $250,000 a week. From
a nondescript building in Chats-
worth, just outside Los Angeles,
Clapper runs a company known vari-
ously as Blue Stone Management,
Sequoia Game Enterprises and Dia-
mond Game Enterprises. There he
assembles electronic slot machines for
about $2,500 apiece, and leases them 
to Indian tribes in exchange for 15%
or more of the profits.

Casino, which features Clapper ma-

evening when auto traffic is almost nonexis-
tent. There's a sense of isolation too; the
140,000 residents are bordered by a wide,
empty plain on one side and steep moun-
tains on the other.
  The famous Agees were courted, natu-
rally, by high-level executives and their
spouses from MK and elsewhere. "When
they first arrived," says a Boise woman, "the
place was all 'Oh, wow!' Everybody was in
the curiosity-gossipy zone. Wives who used
to wear miniskirts were being all matronly
and respectable, wanting to be noticed,
wanting to have them over for dinner."
  The attention wasn't always a warm em-
brace. Pat Moore, who piloted the company
plane, sensed resistance to the Agees even
before they arrived. He traces it to Agee's
first wife, Diane, a former Boise resident
who had endured his public romancing of
Mary eight years earlier, and who had many 
friends and sympathizers there. Mary por-
trayed her as cold and difficult in a book she
wrote in 1984, descriptions that didn't play
well in Boise. "The resistance to Bill and
Mary goes back to his first wife," says 
Moore. "She was well liked here."
  The fallout from Agee's first marriage was
compounded by the way he left his wife. In
order to marry Cunningham in her church,
he converted to Catholicism and had his first
marriage annulled. (Mary also had her first
marriage annulled.) Mike Shirley, a former
VP of finance at Morrison Knudsen, said
Boiseans were dismayed. "Most people can
maybe understand getting a divorce. But


  Mary's chief interest was the Nurturing 
Network, a charity she founded that offers
help, including housing and jobs, to give
pregnant college and working women an al-
ternative to abortion. It was an activity that
made her highly visible to bishops and car-
dinals in the Catholic Church and, even to-
day, much of her life appears to revolve 
around it. In the days after Agee was fired,
several church leaders sent letters of en-
couragement to her.
  Agee, who should have been sensitive to 
nepotism charges after his experience at
Bendix, put Mary in charge of another char-
ity, the Morrison Knudsen Foundation. It 
spends close to $1 million a year on social
and cultural causes. Because running the
two charities took considerable effort, Mary
was rarely in a mood to socialize. "Did I, at
the end of the day, enjoy putting on a
sparkly dress and greeting employees?" she 
once said. "No. I'm tired at the end of the
day. I'm not the kind of person with painted
nails." Even opponents concede that Mary's
commitment to her charities was sincere.
"She's not a hypocrite," says one.
  Agee's devotion to his wife seemed exces-
sive at times. For a surprise birthday party at
Pebble Beach in 1991, he flew friends and


okay to tip your hat, but he made Mary the
centerpiece. He did the same thing when we
were opening a railcar rehab plant in Chi-
cago and the governor was present."
  Mary, by all accounts, is a complicated,
unusual woman. "She is the most astound-
ing mix of interesting, spiritual, funny,
driven," says an executive who was a fre-
quent companion of both Agees. "She
wants to save the world, and she wanted to
help Bill succeed." What really drives the
relationship between them is, of course, un-
knowable. There is plenty of simple and
genuine affection. But Agee often seemed 
overprotective of her-~as if burdened by 
guilt that he had crippled her career with
his Bendix speech. Agee tried hard to make
Morrison Knudsen succeed, says the exec-
utive who knows both Bill and Mary, but his
loyalties were divided between the com-
pany and his wife. "Once on the plane he
looked at me with tears in his eyes and said,
'The first time, I put my job, my kids, my
wife in that order. And that's exactly the
wrong order.'" He adds, "If Bill had a
choice of screwing things up at MK or 
screwing things up with Mary, he'd rather
screw up MK."
  Rightly or wrongly, Boiseans were of-


of a local Catholic charity with a fat contribu-
tion, then withheld the gift when no seat was
offered. Another rumor had Mary screaming 
at a florist's delivery boy who arrived too
early; the boy was said to be the grandson of
Joe Albertson, founder of the supermarket 
chain. There were more: Mary was undergo-
ing dialysis. Mary and Bill donated a $100,000
gold cross to the local cathedral and secretly
stuck MK with the tab. None of these rumors
had any apparent basis in fact. "You couldn't 
go anywhere in Boise without people saying,
'Did you hear about Mary?'" says a promi-
nent local attorney.

TROUBLE


company plane for himself, arranged over-
size bonuses, and stuffed the board with ea-
sygoing cronies. Alas, none of that is as rare
as it should be in business-~and is ignored
if all goes well.
  Agee's fatal flaw was his weakness as a 
manager. A CFO at heart, he relied on buy-
ing and selling assets so much that he ob-
scured MK's problems and his own short-
comings until it was too late. "He was a 
dealmaker, not a manager," says one Wall
Street analyst. "He never thrived in a line
business." Agee didn't understand the con-
struction business, and his detour into rail-
cars was about as well planned and exe-
cuted as the charge of the Light Brigade.
His optimism and buoyancy, while engag-
ing, hurt him as well, enabling him to keep
saying things would be okay if he could just
buy more time and raise more cash until,
like Captain Queeg in the storm, he had to
be relieved of command.
  Pinning blame for Agee's dreadful rela-
tions with MK employees-~and Boise it-
self-~is harder. Was he vastly more insen-
sitive than other CEOs in the way he fired
and laid off people? Or was the resentment 
and anxiety of employees exacerbated by
the dearth of job alternatives in a small
town like Boise? Was Mary truly haughty 
and highfalutin? Or was she simply un-
happy to be in Boise, and unwittingly rat-
tling the natives by using crystal in a place
more comfortable with paper cups? Was


Bill so hopelessly in love with Mary that he
abandoned his responsibilities to Morrison
Knudsen? Or were MK employees intoler-
ant of his unabashed affection for her? Who
knows? In any case, Bill and Mary failed to
divine the cultural peculiarities of Boise and
Morrison Knudsen, which is something peo-
ple who earn $2.4 million a year are sup-
posed to be able to do.
  Agee gets occasional calls from well-wish-
ers, but he lives in exile, far from the glam-
orous world he once inhabited. The friends
he put on the Morrison Knudsen board are
angry and humiliated by the problems that
erupted so suddenly there, and some have
not spoken to him since his ouster. He sits
on no boards of public companies. Despite
his spectacular Elba at Pebble Beach, arthri-
tis keeps him from playing much golf. He is
stung, he says, by reports that portray him as
dishonest. Mostly, he is wearied by the 
whole experience. "At no time was this a fun
job."
  Mary, says an old friend, is stunned by her
husband's firing but praying for the people 
who did it. With real passion, she told one
caller, "I want to convey to you how much 
my husband loved that company. He
worked so hard I didn't see him a whole lot
and my children didn't, and that's what
breaks my heart." Morrison Knudsen em-
ployees weren't so upset. On the day Agee
was axed, they gathered in the parking lot at
company headquarters and cheered. ~

The Backswing Arc

Like Sam Snead and Seve Ballesteros before him, Ernie
Els swings the club with exceptionally smooth tempo,
timing, and rhythm.
  From first move to finish, the elements of Els's action
flow together seamlessly. This beautiful timing lets him
whip the club faster than 125 mph yet appear so graceful
that you'd swear he's swinging in slow motion.
  But many golfers make a fast swing without such out-
standing results. What makes Els different? He generates
power by swinging the club smoothly with his arms, not
violently with his hands as many amateurs do. By keep-
ing the hands quiet, the club stays very low to the ground
for the first two feet of the backswing. This long, low
takeaway is vital to creating a wide arc.


  The width of Els's stance also encourages the long,
arms-controlled takeaway. Els spreads his feet consider-
ably wider apart than his shoulders, and sets his hands
behind the ball. Standing too narrow with the hands
ahead can lead to picking up the club quickly in the take-
away, which shrinks the size of the arc.
  Once the club swings past his right foot and his weight
starts shifting to the right side, Els actively turns his
shoulders, extending his hands and the club straight back
while keeping his wrists firm. The straighter his arms
and the longer his wrists stay firm, the greater the dis-
tance between the clubhead and his body. Look at the
width of his swing at the halfway point! It doesn't get 
wider-~or better-~than that.

 
  "I don't know how I got through
the week, the day, the last hole," he 
said. "I just held it all in until the last
putt, then let it all out. I do believe in
fate and that's what this was all
about."
  Love was in the interview room
when Crenshaw's last putt dropped 
and he felt himself choke up when he
saw Crenshaw's tears. "If I had been 
alone, I would have cried, too," he 
said.
  Of course, he would have. This 
was a Masters worthy of tears. Tears
of joy, tears of sorrow. Tears for a
man and a tournament both worth 
remembering.
  Now and forever. ~

WHAT TO WATCH FOR...May 15 through June 15

that cosmology is dominated by the-
ory rather than observation. Cer-
tainly the popular pantheon of cos-
mologists is dominated by theorists
like Einstein and Hawking, but cos-
mology continues to be grounded in
the process of describing what we
see when we look up at the sky. The
Big Bang theory, relativity, and
quantum mechanics were forced 
down the throat of the scientific
community because observation re-
quired us to accept them.
  Physical cosmology, as viewed by
working scientists, might well be
solved soon. This will not end the 
work of science, nor should it chill
any other human conversation.
Since the time of Galileo, it has
been largely voices from outside cos-
mology who have perceived it as a
threat to the legitimacy of other
ways of looking at the world. But 
our bullhorns are, and always have
been, as paper cones compared with
those of political philosophers,
preachers, and others who promote
their own perspectives.

  Thanks to Edwin Dobb for expos-
ing the absurdity-~or anthropomor-
phism-~of scientific fundamentalists
who claim that absolute truth, or
the Mind of God, can be known via
physics or by any scientific means.
I'd like to add another coal to his
fire by re-introducing a simple ob-
servation: As human beings, our
ability to taste, touch, smell, hear,
and see are all we can use to extract 
knowledge. Meanwhile, it is entirely
possible that there are physical laws
that function outside of our sensory
domain, out of science's reach, and
while we can imagine this possibili-
ty, we cannot imagine the substance
of that possibility.
  The notion of extrasensory exis-
tence frustrates the scientific funda-
mentalists just as the notion that
the Earth is not flat once frustrated
other religions. Until we can prove
that nothing in the universe is lost
to our senses, the assertion that
physicists can offer Universal Truth
is absolute rubbish. To follow

conference, whose stated aim is "Strengthening
Democracy," is the man on whose generous tab
a number of them are spending the weekend, in
comfortable rooms with MTV, CNN, mini-
bars, and a lavish buffet in the Esplanade dining
hall: the American uncle himself-~Carl Gersh-
man, the president of the National Endowment
for Democracy. As Gershman leans in toward 
the microphone, the tension covers the room
like a thick, wet fog. Many of the Eastern Euro-
peans have paid their own way here, leaving 
behind the fragile work of editing  newspapers
and radio broad-
casts, educating cit-


important that the conference have concrete
results. What is the National Endowment for
Democracy? they wonder. How much money
will it give? In the gilt-edged mirrors behind 
Gershman's head is reflected the enormous jew-
eled scarab, with its Byzantine reds and blues, 
that sits in the center of the ballroom ceiling, a
woman's gold brooch blown up to several thou-
sand times its original size.
  The microphone buzzes, but the Eastern Eu-
ropeans are too deep in their imaginings to
flinch. "The National Endowment for Democ-
racy is an independent, nongovernmental foun-
dation which receives a grant from the Con-
gress every year for the purpose of strengthening
democracy around the world," Gershman be-
gins. He is a tall, thin man with the look of a
modern-day Calvinist who has given up the
corruptions of the flesh for a pure diet of univer-
salist ideas. "We have a journal in which we
publish essays and articles on democracy, and
we organize research conferences on democra-
cy," Gershman explains. "We are compiling a 
database which will soon be available over the
Internet. We will hold our fifth world confer-
ence on democracy in Washington on May 1.
We do work in ninety-two countries around the
world," he continues, "in China, Uzbekistan,
and, yes, the countries in this region."
  At the mention of the ninety-two countries, 
you can see the eyes of the former Yugoslavs
narrow with the effort of mental arithmetic, a
calculus whose result can be seen a few seconds 
later in a universal slump of the shoulders. This
slump deepens several minutes later with the
presentation by the Endowment's shrewd and 
genial program officer for Central Europe, Paul
McCarthy. "A good chunk of our money goes


to four U.S.-based organizations," says Mc-
Carthy, with the air of a teacher explaining 
some unpleasant fact of nature to his wonder-
ing pupils, like the way the female praying
mantis bites off the head of the male when 
they make babies, "the Free Trade Union Insti-
tute, which you have heard from, the National
Democratic Institute, the International Repub-
lican Institute, the Center for International
Private Enterprise. The rest of the money ..."
   Among the more experienced of the partici-
pants, the change in manner is immediately
evident. They have stopped taking notes. The 
ninety-two countries, the broad, friendly
smiles, the global visions of building democra-
cy-~you can see them adding it all up to con-
clude that there will be no computers, no 
printing presses, no radio transmitters, no
money for paper, no hands-on assistance of the
kind (the participants are quick to inform you)
given to them by the representatives of George
Soros, the American financier.
  Like any rich man who gives away some
large portion of his estate without any immedi-
ate motive, George Soros has attained among
the Eastern European participants the unques-
tioned authority of a god. The absence of
Soros Foundation representatives at this con-
ference is the subject of incessant conspiratori-
al conversations over cigarettes and coffee in
the Esplanade lounge, where black-bearded 
Montenegrin men, the stars of the confer-
ence-~all well over six feet tall and carrying 
themselves with the atavistic air of having 
stepped out of some faded nineteenth-century
engraving of Balkan mountain bandits-~raise
silver-headed walking sticks at hawkish Mace-
donian women. There is a plot to undermine 
George Soros financed by the government of
Greece, which opposes the work of Soros in
Macedonia. The Greek government is respon-
sible for the recent article attacking Soros, an
article filled with lies and provocations, by 
Connie Bruck in The New Yorker magazine.
They shake their heads. Don't the Americans 
understand that it is only Soros who helps us?
The editor of The New Yorker, someone ex-
plains, is a Greek with ties to the secret police.
No, no, someone objects, it is her husband, an
Englishman, who has ties to the army.
  Objections to these and other amazing ideas
are met with the gentlest of stares and only the
slightest discernible rolling of eyes: Americans 
are, after all, a very young people. Are we not
aware that the Serbs and the Croats will soon   
go to war? And that, when they do, surround-
ing countries with claims to the region-~the
Albanians and the Greeks; the Russians, with
their Slavic ties to the Serbs; the Muslim
Turks, who once ruled Bosnia; the Italians,

DOUBLE ACROSTIC NO. 149


IN RECENT YEARS, Central America has begun
a surprising transition from rule by arms-~
and opposition by violence-~to govern-
ment by free and fair elections. Of the six
nations of the Mesoamerican isthmus, only
Costa Rica had a democratic regime in 1980,
though Honduras' de facto military president
was by then engineering a gradual transition to
civilian rule. Nicaragua had just begun what
would become a decade of Marxist-Leninist
revolution and of violent struggle against coun-
terrevolution. El Salvador was spinning toward
civil war as a US-backed junta struggled to sur-


vive against explosive popular opposition and
a revolutionary insurrection. In Guatemala, a
fraudulently elected military president faced a
rapidly rebuilding leftist guerrilla insurgency.
Panama's president, chosen indirectly by a non-
partisan "revolutionary" assembly, was a fig-
urehead for populist military leader Omar
Torrijos. The prospects for democracy could
hardly have been bleaker.
  Though Central America's authoritarian rul-
ers frequently held elections, they also fre-
quently manipulated and undermined those
elections through shenanigans of every sort.
With the exception of Costa Rica, no regime in
the isthmus had ever held a free and fair elec-
tion and then peacefully transferred power to a
victorious opponent prior to 1980. Once again
excluding Costa Rica, from 1930 to 1979, Cen-
tral American nations averaged one coup d'~~tat
per decade and a presidential election (mostly
fraudulent or overturned by force) only once
every seven years.
  Since 1980, however, Central America-~like
the rest of Latin America and much of the
former Communist world-~has undergone a
democratic transformation. Most of the nations


of the isthmus are now governed by fairly 
elected and constitutional civilian regimes. Per-
haps the most startling evidence of this demo-
cratic transformation is that in the most recent
election in every Central American nation, in-
cumbents from one party have willingly relin-
quished power to their freely elected opponents.
The causes of this transition from authori-
tarianism to democracy, the nature of the re-
cent electoral reforms and the prospects for de-
mocracy on the isthmus all warrant thorough
investigation.

Background of Electoral Reform
  Although Central America's first indepen-
dent governments were constitutional repub-
lics, they failed to establish a strong tradition of
democracy. Except for Panama's US-influenced
secession from Colombia in 1903, the modern
Central American nations first formed in 1823
as provinces of the Central American Federa-
tion (CAF). The CAF opted for a republican con-
stitution, thus grounding the government's le-
gitimacy in the consent of the people. The
principle of republicanism survived in the
fledgling nations' constitutions after the
federation's breakup, circa 1840. Despite such
republican pretensions, however, true popular
sovereignty developed very slowly in Central
America. During most of the 19th century, elites
dominated politics and governed by intrigue 
and force of arms more commonly than by bal-
lots. Presidents were elected indirectly, and par-
ticipation in the few elections that took place
was typically confined to literate, property-
owning males.
  Direct presidential elections, the secret bal-
lot and universal male and female suffrage were
not achieved throughout the region until 1965.
Moreover, these legislated improvements did
not guarantee an effective electoral role for the 
populace. Authoritarian rulers regularly ma-
nipulated elections and repressed their politi-

Mixed Migration
Strategy for Refugees and Economic Migrants


TODAY, MORE THAN EVER, the tumultuous
movements of people occurring through-
out the world are pushing the problems of
migration and forced displacement to the
top of the international agenda. A com-
plex mix of economic, demographic, social, re-
ligious, ethnic and political processes occurring
simultaneously at the local, national and inter-
national levels are forcing people to move away
from their homes and countries. This article fo-
cuses on one aspect of the larger migration de-
bate: refugee movements-~particularly where
these refugee movements are mingled with eco-


nomic migration.
  The security concerns of affected states are
dominated by the violent causes of forced dis-
placement, but the problem of migration has
many different facets. Poverty, economic de-
cline, environmental degradation and demo-
graphic pressures lead people to move to new
areas in search of a better livelihood. These
factors also exacerbate the inequities arising 
out of religious, ethnic or political divisions
that may lead to violence and further refugee
flow. Thus, the same or similar situations may
produce both refugees and economic mi-
grants. Given the ease of international travel, 
both groups may move to the same countries
or areas. This mixed character of today's
movements necessitates a comprehensive 
strategy that meets the diverse needs of refu-
gees and economic migrants and simulta-
neously addresses the causes and solutions
of their problems.
  Any comprehensive response to population
movement must be based on a clear under-
standing of the international refugee system
and the fundamental difference between refu-
gee flows and migratory movements.


Responses to Forced Migration

 Today, there are over 20 million refugees and
persons of concern to the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) who
have been forced to flee their country in fear of
persecution, war and violence. The majority of
refugees and other persons of concern to
UNHCR are in Africa (7.5 million) and Europe
(6 million), followed by Asia (5.7 million) and
the Americas (1.4 million). The number of mi-
grants worldwide is estimated to be over 100
million.
  Their need for international protection sets
refugees apart from economic migrants. Refu-
gees flee because their governments are unwill-
ing or unable to protect them from persecution
for reasons of race, nationality, political opin-
ion or religious belief. More commonly, refu-
gees flee from the brutal effects of internal con-
flict and violence. Economic migrants, on the
other hand, move in search of improved em-
ployment opportunities or for other personal
reasons. Though their reasons for moving may
be compelling, they are not of the same life-
threatening quality as in the case of refugees.
  Perhaps because of this difference, the issue
of interstate migration has remained within the
sovereign prerogative of states, whereas the 
granting of international protection to refugees
has come within the purview of international
law. UNHCR and the 1951 Convention relating 
to the Status of Refugees form the basis upon
which the post World War II refugee system 
was established. UNHCR was mandated by the
UN General Assembly to provide international
protection to refugees and to find solutions to
their problems, such as voluntary repatriation
or integration in a new community. The 1951
Convention relating to the Status of Refugees
binds party states to internationally agreed stan-
dards for the admission, protection and treat-
ment of refugees. One of the most important

sider, but careful deliberation upon the 
fundamentals outlined here will be a ma-
jor step toward solidifying and validating
a global free trade system.

Positive Sums from Cooperation

  The bottom line of the emergence of the
new WTO from GATT is that world trade 
will be institutionalized in the formal legal
structure of an international organization.
The more formal status of the WTO will
allow it to give more focus and publicity to
efforts that attempt to create greater global
cooperation in international trade. The in-
stitutionalization of trade through the
WTO will give some bite to the bark of a
well-articulated set of trading rules and
policies. With its creation, there will exist
an independent political entity that can
view the world trading system from a ho-
listic perspective and to check and balance 
competing interests that seek to bend the
trading rules in their national or sectoral
favor. By paying judicious attention to the
fundamental issues in international trade,
the WTO has the potential of becoming a
visionary organization that outlines a bold
path for international trade and leads the
world into a new economic renaissance.
  Recent studies have released estimates
of the global economic effects of the ratifi-
cation of the GATT Uruguay Round and
the creation of the World Trade Organiza-
tion. A GATT report released in Novem-
ber 1994 prognosticated that implementa-
tion of the Uruguay Round will spur an
increase of $510 billion a year in world in-
come by the year 2005. This figure is a vast
underestimate, for it does not account for 
the impact of strengthened procedures and
rules in the services trade or better dispute
settlement mechanisms. Breaking up the
gains by region, the report predicted that
by 2005 the annual income gain will be
$122 billion for the United States, $164 bil-
lion for the European Union, $27 billion
for Japan and $116 billion for the develop-
ing and transitional socialist economies as
a group. Figures estimating the increase in
volume in the goods trade range from nine
to 24 percent once the liberalization of the
Uruguay Round comes into effect. In 1992
dollars, this gain represents an increase in
trade flows of upwards of $670 billion. The 
report also suggests that Uruguay Round
provisions for developing and transition
economies will have the intended result of
encouraging rapid growth, as exports and
imports from this group are likely to be 50
percent over and beyond the increase for
the rest of the world as a whole. The eco-
nomic impact of a well-structured and
credible institutionalization of interna-
tional trade is likely to be enormous.
  What remains to be done is the actual

than had been originally estimated,
thanks to difficulties in getting the soft-
ware up to speed. That delay shut down
sales and precipitated the business's in-
augural cash crisis. It was a rite of pas-
sage for Kashou the salesman, who
learned that if he had no code, he had no
product, and if he had no product, he had
no sales. As the Collectech sales jocks
put it, "No heat, no eat."
  If the original system was antiquated, it
was the best the company could do on a 
start-up budget. Once it was finally run-
ning, it sufficed. After all, it had only to
fire off letters and keep track of them.
  But problems quickly began to prolifer-
ate. Data-corrupting disk-drive crashes
drove home the importance of hardware
reliability. Having to cajole a contract pro-
grammer to add features and fix bugs initi-
ated Kashou into the mysteries of software
and those who wrote it. He was getting a 
crash course in computers, like it or not,
on the front lines of his business.
  The company's sales soared, from 
$170,000 in its first year to a profitable
million dollars in revenues in year three.
But the rapid growth only exacerbated
problems with an inflexible and not al-
ways reliable system. Even when the disk
wasn't crashing, it lumbered through

queries like a weary nag, whirring end-
lessly before finding the answer to a re-
quest. Because the database behind it was
little but one huge file, finding information
meant navigating an essentially unmarked
forest of bits and bytes. Searches took for-
ever. And every report had to be custom
designed by the contract programmer.
Nothing could be modified or repaired
without him.
  When the reliability problems became
too frequent and too frightening to bear,
Kashou persuaded his partners to invest in
transferring the software to a PC network.
But the contract programmer never did
get the old software to run quite right on 
the new hardware. Screens froze, forcing
users to continually reboot. Memory er-
rors corrupted files, scuttling the day's
work. A simple data-entry error could 
stupefy the system and derail the daily
batch processing of letters and invoices.
Having to restart the system could shut 
operations down for an entire day. The 
company was accumulating strikes with
important accounts.
  The company's second system also
lacked badly needed features, such as ac-
counting capabilities. Service reps still
had to track commissions and accounts
receivable manually. The software
couldn't accommodate credit terms and
other specially negotiated service and
payment plans that salespeople were
now regularly extending to customers.
  To cope, the back-office troops created
a web of spreadsheets and manual track-
ing methods. The beleaguered controller
reconciled revenues manually each week
and juggled no fewer than a dozen spread-
sheets to come up with financial state-
ments each month. Meanwhile, the com-
pany was bringing in new clients at the
rate of two a day. By 1991 there were 
nearly a million debtor records in the
cranky system. And the problems were
getting worse.
  But Kashou kept putting off a system
overhaul. It wasn't until 1992, when sales
reached $3.2 million, and profits, after
generous bonuses, had neared half a mil-
lion that executive vice-president Brad
Jadwin stepped before the company board
to plead for an entirely new system. "The
snafus were starting to affect us in the 
marketplace," says Jadwin. "We were
risking client relationships."

was possible because places like Milan had no less than
five mail deliveries every day. You could drop a line to
friends in the city and be fairly confident that they
would receive it in, say, three hours; if you sent the note
in the morning to friends in the suburbs, it would arrive
by nightfall. All of which means that Verdi and Boito
would probably have derived little benefit from E-mail-~
they had a good post office.
  The the archivist showed me some of Verdi's corre-
spondence during a production of, I believe, A~~~da at the
Paris Opera. Evidently the show was not going well. Af-

@ Work


Most of the time I work out of my
home, a big log cabin in Cen-
tennial, Wyo. The town was 
founded in 1876 and brags a population
of about 100. Right off our back deck is
the north fork of the Laramie River. We're
at 8,200 feet and surrounded by Aspen
trees. We have a wood-burning stove, and
we sleep in a log bed that my wife, Brenda,
made by hand. When we moved out here, I 
figured I was going to become this moun-
tain-man-type person. Well, I spend all
my time up in this mountain-man cabin-~
but working on the computer. Meanwhile,
my wife goes shopping for the day and
comes back with a brand-new chain saw. 
  The business I work for, Aspen Tree
Software, which helps companies comput-
erize employee interviews, is really flexi-
ble about letting its employees telecom-
mute. It has a very loose structure, but
only because everybody works to keep
communication tight. We have a Shiva
network at the main office, in Laramie,
that I can hook into from my cabin. We
also use a program called Close-Up,
which allows those of us off-site to dial
into one another's computers. I go into the
office once or twice a week, and that's


pretty much when I need to talk to people
rather than do creative-type things.
  In my home office I put my Schwinn
Air Dyne bike underneath a large, 53-
inch-high desk platform, and I sometimes
pedal while I work. My office also has a 
Postscript printer, a fax machine, a 486
computer with two gigabytes of hard-
drive space, a six-disk CD-ROM drive,
and an STB Lightning video card with two
megs of RAM. That's pretty heady stuff.
  I'm a discus thrower and have been on
some international shot-put teams. I went
to the Olympic trials for track and field in
1988 and 1992, and am considering going
in '96. Two or three times a year I video-
tape myself throwing. I'll capture the shots 
in a digitized format on the computer and
then study them to improve my technique.
  On nice days I'll take a laptop, a
Thinkpad 486 with 16 megs of RAM, and
go up in the mountains to train-~legwork
stuff like sprints or climbing-~and as ideas
pop into my head, I have everything right
there and can run with them. I usually set
the laptop on the front of my Chevy truck
or on one of the rock outcroppings. Every
once in a while I'll go up in the mountains
for three or four days-~there are some


cabins up there. I'll take a cellular, and
that's the only phone contact I'll have.
  You definitely have to be a self-starter
to work this way. I'd say I work 75% on
inspiration and 25% on discipline, just be-
cause I'm so into it. If I have an idea at 2
a.m., I know I'm going to just pop up to
my office and execute it. My philosophy
for the past eight years has been that every
day's a weekend, but I work weekends.
  On a typical day I wake up between 3
and 6 a.m. and immediately go to my of-
fice to work. This is pure uninterrupted
development time. At sunrise I go for a 
short walk or run and plan the day. The
mountains are to the south and west, and
there are 30 miles of open plains to the
east before there are more mountains,
which makes for spectacular sunrises.
  Around noon in the summer I put on my 
waders, grab my fly rod, and head 10 miles
up the road, where there are 150 alpine
lakes within a 5-mile radius. I'll spend an
hour or so there, catching little brook trout.
  From 7:30 until bedtime is another sa-
cred development time. Occasionally I'll
pull an all-nighter. When I do, I'm good till
about 5 p.m. before I crash and make my
whole schedule haywire for several days.~

COMMENTARY


Why the Dollar is Down


IF THE UNITED STATES WERE NOT
still the world's preeminent
economic power with the most
important currency, the In-
ternational Monetary Fund
would be ordering President Clinton to bal-
ance the federal budget, cut back imports, and
raise interest rates and/or taxes to repair U.S.
accounts with the rest of the world.
  That's what the IMF has done to other coun-
tries, from Germany to Britain to Mexico, for
more than five decades since it was set up in
1944. It has acted as the world's banker and
arbiter, telling nations to get their economic
houses in order if they want further credit.
  The United States has been exempt from
such strictures because of its power and the
dollar's role as reserve currency, the money
all countries rely on as an ultimate means of
exchange in global trade. Thus it has been
able to run trade and budget deficits without
taking immediate action to correct them.
  Lately, however, those continued U.S.
deficits have begun to look like the self-indul-
gence of a pampered adolescent. The United
States has been reprimanded in recent years
by gradual reductions in the dollar's value
and in U.S. influence in the world.
  But now the overgrown adolescent is
going to the woodshed. A sterner reckoning is
coming that will demand the United States
move toward a balanced budget and run its
affairs to support the value of the dollar.
  We should understand why that is, be-
cause other currency crises will follow this
one unless corrective action is taken.
  In the aftermath of the dollar's latest
swoon against the German mark and Japan-
ese yen, international experts say an extraor-
dinary meeting of the seven leading industri-
al countries will be convened, probably next
month, to stabilize currency relationships and
possibly increase U.S. interest rates by as 
much as a full percentage point.
  Yes, that would slow the U.S. economy and
impose hardships on Americans. But that's the
fate of borrowers with slipping credit ratings,
and U.S. credit has been falling among global


ployment. That's why Ger-

Perpetual Stagnation
  Unfortunately, the IS managers
who declare their careers are at a
dead end are right. Worse, the IS pro-
fession perpetuates this stagnation
by remaining silent while pundits
proclaim that IS managers must
learn the business to gain admission
to the boardroom.
  Experienced professionals in
accounting, human resources, or
sales are commonly thought capable
by senior management of offering
sound advice outside the bounds of
their profession. However, similarly
experienced IS professionals are
almost universally presumed to be


lacks confidence in the person's
basic business abilities, it's safe to
conclude the CEO made a major hir-
ing mistake.
  Yet, if the IS manager is compe-
tent, then why isn't that manager
sitting in on important decisions?
Unfortunately, most CEOs aren't
even aware that a problem exists.
  There is a likely historical expla-
nation for this tendency to isolate
otherwise competent adults. Decades
ago, computers were the province of
a few technicians who supported
accounting and finance, but were
otherwise isolated from the organi-
zation. Although IS today supports
virtually all of a company's business
functions, IS managers remain en-
meshed in a system that is biased
against them.
  We can understand this system by


reviewing a simple chain of cause
and effect. IS is the corporate infra-
structure of all sizeable businesses.
Pare it away and the business will
halt and die.
  The dependence on a field as
young as IS has unfortunate conse-
quences: IS is feared, and it makes
people frustrated and angry because
it's not well understood. When igno-
rance, fear, and anger are present,
human nature responds with neglect
and organizational abuse: the glass
ceiling. It exists even when both IS
and general management want to do
a good job and work as a team.
  What can you do about this fun-
damental inequity and organization-
al shortsightedness?
  Not much. You aren't in a position
to change your organization alone.
However, here are two actions we
can take to start a movement toward
healthier organizations:
  First, IS managers must stop beat-
ing themselves up about imaginary
inadequacies. We should need to do
no more than professionals in other
fields in order to join senior manage-
ment as peers.
  Second, next time you hear some-
one decry the lack of business knowl-
edge among IS professionals, ask
them why they aren't also condemn-
ing this failing among colleagues in
sales or engineering. Don't let people 
say that your profession is not up to
the mark when it's simply not true.
Unless you challenge them, you're
part of the problem.

I've been hearing more and more about
how libraries are going to become
obsolete. The theory holds that the
advent of computer networks will
enable students to sit at their computers
and find all they need to know. People
will download books and government infor-
mation and will retrieve forms from databas-
es. Best of all, through the virtual library you
will be able to obtain information immedi-
ately and in the comfort of your home.
  This cyberlibrarian would be sad to
see libraries go the way of horse-drawn
carriages. Libraries for me are places to
work and play, and the Web just hasn't
managed to capture the atmosphere, con-
templative silence, and feel of a book in my
hands that I get at a library.
  Still, the Internet has the advantage of
always being open and often has more cur-
rent information. I believe the Internet will
complement libraries and not replace them.
That's why I'm surprised when people ask
me where to find "the library" on the
Internet. I tend to think of the whole
Internet as a library resource. What these
people are looking for are the traditional
library resources on the Internet. Although
it's not an exhaustive list, following are
some of the places I patronize.

Books, E-Zines, Facts
One of my favorite Internet sources is
Project Gutenberg, an online library of clas-
sics. The project's goal is "to provide a col-
lection of 10,000 of the most used books by
the year 2001." Relying on volunteers,
Project Gutenberg has already put the full
text of many books online. If you'd like to
browse the archive or volunteer to help, ftp
to wuecon.wustl.edu. To obtain the latest infor-
mation, subscribe to the mailing list by send-
ing a message to listserv@viucvmd.bitnet with


sub gutnberg Your Name in the message body.
You must include two words in your name.
Do not list your title or occupation because 
doing so will hold up your subscription.
  Magazines also are migrating to the
Internet. There are hundreds of electronic
magazines (called e-zines), but if you're
interested in the paper-published ones, trav-
el to the Table of Contents site at http://
www.mag-browse.com. Run by Cyberspace 
Publishing, it provides the tables of con-
tents and brief summaries of articles of
more than 170 magazines. Categories 
include computers, electronics, music, sci-
ence, and sports. Only the abstracts are pro-
vided; if you want to read the whole article, 
you must buy the magazine.
  The Statistical Abstract of the United
States also is on the Web (at http://www.
census.gov:80/stat_abstract). The site has
tables, graphs, state rankings, and state and
county profiles. It is searchable, but you 
might have better luck following the links.
  Another site of traditional library
sources is CARL, which has periodical
guides as well as Grolier's Academic
American Encyclopedia and Facts on File.
There are fees for some of the services. To
check out CARL, telnet to database.carl.org.
  Cheaper alternatives are sites created 
by universities or public libraries. These
often are great sources, but remember that
they were originally created for their own
communities. Portland Area Library System
has a comprehensive Gopher site with peri-
odical guides, a wide variety of databases,
and a good reference shelf (gopher.portals.
pdx.edu). Its best feature may be the Top 10
lists that let you go to the most popular sites
in a category of your choice.
  One of the best online libraries I've
found is the Gopher site at the Virginia
Military Institute. It's divided into "rooms"


26 INTERNET WORLD JUNE 1995
and houses full-text sources of poetry,
prose, and electronic journals. Its material
includes such diverse topics as career
information, multimedia resources,
recipes, and weather. There's also a
searchable reference collection. To visit,
gopher to vax.vmi.edu.
  The University of Texas hosts the
Virtual Computer Library, a Web site that
provides links to computer and comput-
ing information. Its categories include
books, conferences, journals, magazines,
organizations, and vendors. It's at
http://www.utexas.edu/computer/vcl.
  Another common question people 
ask librarians is, "What is the Internet?"
Matrix Information and Directory
Services (MIDS) provides some answers.
It offers statistics on how many users are
on the Internet and divides them into three 
groups-~core, consumer, and matrix.
You'll also find press releases and news
about the Internet. To sample its wares,
browse over to http://www.tic.com/mids/
midshome.html.
  To view the Internet Society's recent
Domain Survey of registered hosts on the
Internet, jump over to http://www.nw.com.
The Internet Society's home page is at
http://www.isoc.org.
  If you're interested in information
about the World-Wide Web, go to its
birthplace-~CERN, the particle physics
laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland.
Conference papers, software, relevant
newsgroups, and just about anything else
you want to know about the Web can be
found at the site at http://www.cern.ch.

Things Political
Are you following the upcoming 1996 elec-
tion? Many candidates have already 
declared their intention to run for office,
and issues are being defined. A list of
Republicans who will, might, and will not
run in 1996 is available at http://www.umr.
edu/~sears/primary/main.html. There are links
to the National Election Newsgroup and
National Republican Newsgroup and an
option to subscribe to a Republican listserv.
  Another online resource for Repub-
lican politics is http://www.berkelyic.
com/conservative. This site has information
about Republican candidates, news, and 
links to related Internet sources. It also lets
you send a fax directly to Rush Limbaugh.
  Can't stand Limbaugh? Then go to
http://falcon.cc.ukans.edu/~cubsfan/antirush.
html for the Anti-Limbaugh Home Page.
Its purpose is summed up in the state-
ment, "We gather here today not to praise
Rush, but to bury him!" You'll find


Rush's 35 Unquestionable Truths Refuted
and an expos~~ on Limbaugh done by
Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting
(FAIR). Readers are invited to send in
"Rush jokes and lies."
  The Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee has established a Web site
(http://www.dscc.org/d/dscc.html) containing
news, press releases, poll statistics, and
quotes related to the 1996 election. It also
provides links to related Net sources.
  The Libertarians have their own Web
site offering press releases, platforms, party
literature, and links to related sites. You can
access it at http://www.lp.org/lp and http://
w3.ag.uiuc.edu/liberty/libWeb.html.
  A government information server
called CapWeb has been created by Capitol
Hill staffers. An unofficial site, CapWeb


ested. There also are biographies of
NOW officers and information about the
organization.
  The American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) maintains a Gopher site that
houses ACLU literature, newsletters, pub-
lications, and court and Congressional
actions in which the organization is
involved-~including a list of current
issues, such as liberties in cyberspace.
There's also a history of the organization,
a list of affiliate offices, and guidelines on
how to get help from the ACLU (gopher
to aclu.org 6601).
  An important issue requiring ongoing
vigilance is human rights. For information
from "independent, non-governmental,
nonpartisan organizations," you can
gopher to humanrights.org 5000 or to
gopher://gopher.humanrights.org:5000. Here
you will find info from groups such as
Amnesty International, Human Rights


support for veterans


and their families. It also has links to
related government information for veter-
ans of other wars. The address is
http://www.wwa.com/~szabo/gulf.html.
  After former President Reagan's
announcement that he has Alzheimer's dis-
ease, interest in the illness has increased. To
acquire some basic information, gopher to
baryon.hawk.plattsburgh.edu, the Alzheimer's
Disease Assistance Center in New York.
  Remember that whether information
is found in a traditional or virtual library,
it is meaningless unless you use it. It's
people acting on knowledge that gives life
to our archives. ~

Moose said.
  Consider the Church of Scientology.
Last year members of the Church can-
celed messages posted by outspoken
detractors of the religion. The group
claimed the posts contained copyrighted
material, but many on the Internet called
the attempt a foul act of censorship.
  Should Usenet messages be automati-
cally censored in software? Is Cancelmoose
a hero or villain? You decide.
  Kevin Fox, a student at the University
of California at Berkeley, uses a less dras-
tic tactic to squelch spammers. He sends
them a polite e-mail message. His elo-
quent message below echoes the consen-
sus of 99 percent of Usenet's populous.
  "We on the Net live by only a few
rules, but one should be most important to
you as an advertiser on the Net (in itself
viewed as an inauspicious venture by
many): There is no message of any level
of importance that warrants being blasted

  "While it is an appealing concept to
reach the broadest possible audience,
imagine if you will, the bliss you would

America Online, the nation's third
largest online service, offers access to
Usenet. Because of it's simple interface
and relative ease of use, America Online
has a reputation for attracting users with
less regard for-~or perhaps knowledge
of-~netiquette. On news.admin.policy, the
merest mention of AOL causes some to
grumble.
  "Most of the spammers from AOL
are simply users who are excited at the
prospect of using this great tool and who
aren't aware of the 'rules of the road'
when it comes to posting," explained
David O'Donnell, AOL's system adminis-
trator. "We go to great lengths to educate
our members on what the Internet and


Usenet are, their conventions, and histori-
cal guidelines."
  "Because AOL is one of the largest
sites on the Internet, we have a propor-
tionally greater exposure in terms of users
and notoriety," O'Donnell maintained.
"Abusers can be characterized into three
groups: the ignorant and usually acciden-
tal abuser, the commercial abuser, and the 
deliberate abuser. The majority of abuse
by our members falls into the first two
categories. Our current educational efforts
are helping address the issues of igno-


periods of time when the trend has
reversed, like during the Christmas sea-
son. It hasn't dropped as much as I would
like, but we're working on some ways to
help acclimate our members to being on
the Usenet, which I think will help the
trend continue downward."
  Will spambots and cancelbots
become the norm on Usenet? Hopefully
not. In time, more sophisticated news dis-
tribution and newsreading software
should stop the problem at its source.
Until then, education of new Internet
users will have to suffice. Unfortunately,
some of us do not wish to be educated but
would rather exploit the Internet's
resources like so much clear-cutting of
virgin forest. The voices may never let
you sleep again.~

times. The content of the spam, or whether it was "on-topic" in the newsgroups in which it
was posted, is irrelevant.

Note that at least a couple copies of this spam have already been canceled by someone else.

In addition to being posted in news.admin.misc, this message is being mailed to the postmas-

HOME-REMODELING DIARY


allowances, or budgets, for certain
items are realistic.
  It's a hard decision. Each has good
references. When pressed, some ref-
erences mention being unhappy with
one contractor's slowness in finishing
up the last bit of work. But we decide
to go with that guy anyway: His work-
manship looks good, he has more
experience and, perhaps most impor-
tant, he's building a strong reputation
in our small community.

EARLY NOVEMBER:
WE SIGN THE CONTRACT

The contractor goes back to his sub-
contractors for final, hard numbers.
Contract price: $51,260. At the same
time Guy files a set of plans with the
city to apply for a building permit, a
process that could take several weeks.
  Even though the contractor keeps
saying he'll be happy to give me
proof of his liability insurance and
license, I haven't seen the documents
yet. We won't sign a contract without
them, and I don't want another delay,
so I call the contractors' licensing sec-
tion of the Virginia Department of 
Professional and Occupational Regu-
lation to confirm his license number
and the expiration date. Everything
checks out.
  While I'm at it, I call the contrac-
tor's insurance company. A represen-
tative confirms that his liability insur-
ance is in effect and offers to send me
a "binder" letter stating so.
  Finally, we sign the contract, a 
standard American Institute of Archi-
tects document provided by the


builder. We amend it a bit to accom-
modate our lack of an architect, and
make a note on the payment sched-
ule that says the "draw," or payment
timetable, is approximate and that
payments will be based on comple-
tion of work. The contract gives the
builder five months to finish work,
though he expects to finish sooner.
(Weather can cause big delays.) We
sign a check for $6,500, roughly 13%
of the contract price, and hand over a
set of keys.
  The contractor pulls the building
permit and pays the $195 fee.
Because he pulled the permit, he is
now responsible for completing the
job and getting final inspections.
  We set up a special checking
account solely to keep track of con-
struction expenditures. We'll have to
save copies of the contract and
receipts practically forever so we can
adjust our tax basis and minimize tax-
es if we ever sell the house.

LATE NOVEMBER:
DIRT FLIES

Just before Thanksgiving, stakes with
orange flags appear in the backyard,
marking the perimeter of the new
foundation. A few days later, "Buddy"
arrives at dawn with his Bobcat and
starts digging. When he's done, the 
hole looks incredibly small.
  After an unusually dry autumn, it
starts to rain. The contractor glibly
refers to the newly dug hole, which is
smack against our basement founda- 
tion, as "the swimming pool." Plastic

MANAGING MONEY: Q&A


By William Giese


PLANNING TO PAY
FOR RETIREMENT
I am planning on retirement at age
65 and have read that I can maintain
my lifestyle on maybe three-fourths of my
preretirement income. Is that based on
gross income or after-tax income? How
do you come up with such a number?
JOHN BROWNE
Elmhurst, Ill.

Most people should need rough-
ly 70% to no more than 90% of pre-
retirement gross income to maintain


rity taxes owed, too. On the other
hand, health care costs tend to rise.
  The higher your preretirement
income, the greater the proportion
of that income you will tend to need
after retirement and the more
you'll have to rely on pensions and
savings. That's because social securi-
ty replaces a much smaller propor-
tion of high earners' incomes and
because with a higher income,
you'll still be paying hefty taxes.
Figures in the table are for married
couples, based on one wage earner
with no dependents. Replacement
ratios for single people


Exxon Corp. and W.R. Grace &
Co., will sell first shares directly to
investors; many more companies
will begin offering first shares soon,
due to a change in Securities and
Exchange Commission rules (see
"The Months Ahead," May). Other-
wise, you can purchase first shares
through a discount brokerage such
as Kennedy, Cabot & Co. (800-252-
0090), which will buy for you any-
where from one to 99 shares of a 
stock for $23 plus the stock price. If
you already own shares of a compa-
ny, ask the shareholder services
department if it offers a DRIP plan.

WRITE OFF
COLLEGE COSTS?
I am a 25-year-old software engineer
in pursuit of my bachelor of science in
computer information systems. I pay


100% of my state-university tuition,
fees and related expenses. Are these
expenses deductible?

RICHARD BUTLER
Tallahassee, Fla.

It depends on what you'll be
doing with your newly acquired
skills. You have to be working for
education costs to be deductible,
and the training you receive must
be related to your present work or
be required by your employer or by
law. College costs relating to a new
job or a new career are not
deductible.
  In your case, if the studies main-
tain or improve skills needed in
your current work as a software
engineer, you can write off tuition,
the cost of books and other related
expenses. You take your write-off as
a miscellaneous deduction on
Schedule A of Form 1040. Note that
you are allowed to deduct only the
amount that exceeds 2% of your
adjusted gross income.

COMPLICATED GIFT
My parents gave me 760 shares of
common stock in a privately owned bank
in 1991. Their cost basis was $20 per 
share. On the date they gave the shares to
me, the price was $25. Last year my
bank was acquired in a stock swap for
which I received 440 shares valued at
$50 each. I recently sold the shares.
What is my cost basis?

RONNIE CHING
Lawrence, Kan.

Your cost basis is the same as it
was for your parents when they
gave you the stock-~$20 per share,
or $15,200 for 760 shares. You 
eventually sold 440 shares, which
after mergers and acquisitions were
worth $50 each, or $22,000. So you
have a $6,800 long-term capital gain
to report on your next income-tax
return. The top tax rate on long-
term capital gains is 28%, although
Congress is considering lowering it
this year. ~

REVIEWS & Quick Clicks


THERE'S BEEN NO DRAMA on the page-
layout-software scene for a while now, but a
recently introduced program from Ger-
many piqued our interest. For years, DTP
titans PageMaker and QuarkXPress have
been chewing up and spitting out any rival
program that dared step into the limelight,
so when Interpress Technologies debuted
VivaPress Professional, we held our breath.
Although we found that the program boasts
several noteworthy features, it's seriously
marred by an ill-conceived interface and
several poorly implemented tools.


The Big Picture
VivaPress Pro takes the same frame-based
approach to layout as QuarkXPress. You
draw frames, called objects in VivaPress-
speak, when you want to enter or import
graphics and text (imports are courtesy of
Claris' XTND technology). Unlike Quark-
XPress, however, which makes you switch
between separate tools for text and graphic
frames, VivaPress Pro uses a single tool.
  Once you've created an object frame, you
assign it text, graphic, or picture attributes.
The program is flexible in that it lets you 
change an object's attribute at any time.
That's the good news. The bad news is that
there's no easy way to access VivaPress Pro's
object-creation tool -~ a key command or a
toggle on the text palette that switched you 
to object mode would be a helpful addition.
  VivaPress Pro's most powerful feature is
the ability to create alias objects, which are
great time-savers if you want to use recur-
ring elements independent of master pages.


Similar to a Finder alias, an alias object
serves as a pointer to an original text or
graphic object. When you make a change to
the original object, all the aliases change
accordingly. Alias objects really shine when
you use them with the program's spiffy Split
command, which chops objects up into
user-defined pieces. Each piece can be des-
ignated as an alias and linked to the current
text chain.
  We weren't as impressed with alias pages,
VivaPress Pro's answer to master pages. A
bug prevents you from deleting objects cre-
ated on alias pages -~ to get rid of an object,
you must first delete it from a document
page and then remove it from the alias page.
  One of the whizzier features in VivaPress
Pro is the ability to add B~~zier curves to ir-
regularly shaped objects by holding down
the Option key when you click on a selection
point -~ a useful feature for creating cus-
tom text blocks, picture shapes, and simple
graphic elements. You can also edit Adobe
Illustrator and Macromedia FreeHand ob-
jects from within VivaPress Pro, although
we found this feature buggy and slow, even
when running the program native on a
Power Mac.
  VivaPress Pro's style sheets outclass the
competitions' in several ways. The program
lets you create style sheets for graphics as
well as for text, and you can apply text style 
sheets to individual characters. Style sheets
are only as good as a program's formatting 
features, however, and because VivaPress
Pro's formatting suffers from several short-
comings, including the inability to apply
rules to paragraphs, the style sheets suffer
accordingly.
  On the surface, VivaPress Pro's typo-
graphic controls seem robust, but closer
scrutiny shows some limitations. The pro-
gram has several typographic controls built
in that PageMaker and QuarkXPress offer 
only through plug-in modules. For exam-
ple, you can define tracking and kerning
settings as document preferences. The
tracking controls are much like Page-
Maker's, although you can specify only one
track per font at five sizes whereas Page-
Maker lets you assign five tracks per font at

spent traversing dialog boxes and menu commands to do things that are easy to accomplish
in more-expensive programs. Take page layout: Employing a program such as Coda's $350
Finale Allegro, it's a simple matter to work with various text and score elements in a single
Page Layout window. Using ConcertWare, you must open a couple of different windows, en-
ter your text, invoke the Print command to access the Print Preview window, return to the
original windows for adjustments, and so on. This rigmarole is regrettably all too typical of
the ConcertWare experience. Other annoyances include a lack of resolution smaller than a
32nd and the lack of a reference card for the plethora of keyboard command equivalents.
  Although ConcertWare is an affordable and reasonably capable notation program, it suf-
fers from an ancient interface. Entry-level musicians and hobbyists may find ConcertWare
adequate, if they're short on cash and long on patience. If your time is valuable, save your
money for a higher-priced, more intuitive package. / Christopher Breen

MAC CLONES


was not ready to test for this issue. For comparison, we also tested
three Power Macs: a 7100/80, an 8100/100, and an 8100/110.
  The three clones performed pretty much as you would expect
from systems that differ technically from their Mac counterparts
only in modest ways. We first ran our core suite of MacBench 2.0
tests. Based on extensive profiling of the top-selling Mac applica-
tions, MacBench is a standard for comparing the speed of the four
major subsystems -~ processor, floating-point, disk, and video -~

of machines that run the Mac OS.MacBench numbers provide data
on the relative speed of Macs being used for typical business tasks.
  Not surprisingly, in the Processor and Floating Point tests, the
clones performed identically to Power Macs that contained the 
same-speed PowerPC processors. The Disk Mix test is sensitive to
the particular drive mechanism and software driver being tested.
Although Apple's Power Macs scored better on this test than the


Power 100 and the Radius System 100, it
would be unfair to conclude that Macs in
general have better disk-subsystem speed
than clones. For example, the Power 100 we
tested didn't have a drive comparable to that
in the Power Mac 8100/100 to which we com-
pared it. In the case of the Radius System
100, the drive for which we show Disk Mix
test results is the internal 540-MB drive,
which we compared to the high-speed inter-
nal 2-GB drive of the Power Mac 8100/110.
  The Radius System 100, however, also
contains a high-speed 2-GB drive, con-
nected to a Fast and Wide SCSI-2 NuBus
card. We used this drive for performing a
series of disk-intensive Photoshop tests.
Unlike most Mac applications, which read
and write data in relatively small blocks,
Photoshop moves data to and from a hard
disk in very large blocks. It was in these tests 
that the custom drive in the Radius System


100 excelled, shoveling data to and from the computer nearly 43
percent faster than the Power Mac's drive.
  In the Video Mix test, the only surprise was the poor showing of
the Thunder IV GX~1600, the cream of Radius' graphics-display/
accelerated-video-adapter crop. Again, however, it's important to
realize that the MacBench Video Mix test is based on typical busi-
ness-application tasks. This test provides a good measure of the
overall snappiness of the Mac interface -~ entering data, typing, 
pulling down menus, clicking on buttons in dialog boxes, and the
like. This is not the type of work graphics-display/accelerated-
video adapters are designed to enhance. When we did a series of
Photoshop image-manipulation tasks (Unsharp Mask, Gaussian
Blur, and Rotate), specialized routines handled by DSP chips on the
Thunder IV card kicked in. In these tests, the Radius System 100
outpaced Apple's top-of-the-line Power Mac by 30 percent.


Foreign Affairs / not all clones will come from the U.S.


MOVE TO JAPAN -~ that's our advice if you're looking for the ultimate
Mac for home entertainment and education. Pioneer, the consumer-
electronics giant, and Bandai, a Japanese-toy-industry leader, have li-
censed the MacOS and rolled out prototypes of their consumer clones.
Pioneer's Multimedia Personal-Computer line will include the
MPC-GX1,which has a 66-MHz PowerPC 601,and the lower-cost MPC-
LX100, powered by a 33-MHz 68LC040. These are fully functioning Mac
clones as well as impressive home-entertainment centers with full AV
capabilities. Each offers video input and capture; a 4.4x CD-ROM drive;
and a built-in stereo speaker system that boasts two tweeters, two
midrange speakers, and an internal subwoofer. Prices, configurations,
and expansion capabilities had not been finalized at press time. Al-
though no plans yet exist to bring either the MPC-GX1 or the MPC-
LX100 to the U.S., a Pioneer spokesperson expressed interest in explor-
ing that possibility after the line's Japanese release this summer.

seem overstated when you first see the tiny 10-x-12-inch black box, but


INTUITIVE HANGING INDENT

to stick with the shows through the May sweeps.
But station reps say the prognosis is not good,
particularly in light of the recent cancellations
of Buena Vista Television's Judge For Yourself
(1.4) and MCA's Suzanne Sommers (.9).
  Greg Nathanson, vp/general manager of

failures among talk shows this season has been
dismaying. "It was not a particularly strong sea-
son for any of the new talk shows," Loszak says.
"The only reason why Gordon has survived is
because it has stayed with the relationship-,
issue-oriented format that has served Ricki, Jen-

which has not served them well." ~

services and the World Wide Web-~and leaving his telco

  The thought makes both MSOs and their potential
content partners drool. "Cable modems are here today,"
says Thomas Turley, Jr., America Online's assistant man-
ager for multimedia and new technology services. "We
have hundreds of people using them right now in their
homes." Hewlett-Packard, Intel, LAN City and Zenith
were all here showing off hardware, and AOL and Prodi-
gy eagerly demonstrated the sorts of multimedia services 
they'll be able to offer once cable modems reach their four
million-odd subscribers a year from now. NBC's AOL
site, for instance, was showing real-time clips of Jurassic
Park and other upcoming network programming. "We
have it stored on a server," Turley said happily, envision-


ing a blessed end to the online services' text-
and-graphics click-and-wait era. "Just hit Play
and it pulls it off the server." Asked what cable
modem services will cost, however, Turley 
hedged. "Cost in our business plan hasn't come
up at all," he said.
  Over in the Hewlett-Packard booth, Jeff
Hornung offered a few hints. Hornung, HP's
marketing manager for interactive broadband
products, spoke with the calm authority of a
businessman who knows he's on the right side
of history. "'96," he said, "will be the year cable
modems take off." HP's second-generation
product, shipping next year, "will hit the
required price point of $400. Every operator
says, 'That's great, but we want to pay $200.' But
our research shows there's a compelling value
proposition at $400. That's the range that
works." HP will also offer cable operators a
suite of services for local content, network
management and billing services. "An operator
can say, 'I want a turnkey service,' said Hor-
nung, "and we'll provide that. We'll design it,
deliver it, install it and support it. Other people
are doing it with alliances. Starting early 1996,
we can do it ourselves." HP, he said, is "looking
to do actual deployments, not trials. We're cur-
rently talking with cable operators," he said,
and "we hope to make some major announce-
ments later this year with a number of MSOs."

its squadron of Thunderbolts threw their
weight into a tank battle between Amer-
ican Shermans and 16 German Tigers
near Wald. When the battle was over, the
unexpected air scourge had knocked out
six German tanks and caused the 10 other 
Tigers to flee.
  Next came the Rhine River. By cross-
ing it, the U.S. Ninth Army would com-
pletely isolate the Ruhr, Germany's rich-
est industrial area. New names of German 
cities appeared in the daily target brief-
ings. Recklinhausen, Dortmund, Essen,
Hamm, Soest, Paderborn-~all were
struck from the air. Thousands of tons of
rolling railroad stock were destroyed per
week. Ruhr factories became islands of
smokestacks and ruined buildings.
  By March 12, 1945, sorties against
rolling stock in the Ruhr were flown from 
German soil itself. On that day, XXIX
TAC became the first American tactical
air command to fly a mission complete
from briefing to interrogation from
German soil. That was when the 373rd
Fighter Group began to operate from a
German airfield, built in 1941 by Dutch
slave labor, just one week after its capture
by American armor.
  Pilots returning from their last mission
over the Ruhr commented on the devas-
tation there: "Germany has a permanent
flame in the Ruhr. It's impossible to see
the ground." "We were over the Ruhr for
two hours from north to south. All we saw
in the way of targets was one motorcycle.
The whole territory looks dead."
  By March 23, 1945, the day the Ninth
Army troops crossed the Rhine River and
established the Wesel-Orsoy bridgehead
into the heart of Germany, the GIs were
asking "Where is the Luftwaffe?" Indeed,
the decimation of the Luftwaffe in the air
and on the ground had progressed relent-
lessly. The Luftwaffe had either been
buried in the wreckage of its own hangars
or shot to shreds over its own air bases
after attacks by XXIX TAC Thunder-
bolts. In the eight days preceding the U.S.
Army's crossing of the Rhine, General
Nugent's planes had immobilized 423
enemy aircraft in a series of concerted
raids on German bases.
  On March 20, one group alone, the 
373rd again, destroyed or damaged 119
enemy aircraft on the ground without
losing a single plane. A star performer of
the day was 1st Lt. Edward B. Edwards,
who destroyed three Junkers Ju-88s and
damaged nine Messerschmitt Bf-109s,
dropping two 500-pounders and making
a dozen strafing passes.
  In five lightning attacks against Luft-
waffe bases at Gutersloh, Paderborn and
Lippstadt the same day, P-47 Thunder-
bolts of Colonel Anthony V. Grosetta's
406th Fighter Group destroyed more than
25 enemy aircraft on the ground and set
fire to at least 12 hangars and buildings.

Neck, Prescott was joined by Israel Putnam's men, who brought
fascines (bundles of small branches woven together and placed
to absorb some of the impact of cannonballs), picks and shov-
els, and empty hogsheads to be filled with soil and used to form
walls for a fort.
  At this time, Prescott called a meeting of senior officers, a
group including Putnam and Colonel Richard Gridley. Prescott
told them his orders were to defend Bunker Hill. After a
lengthy discussion, the group decided Breed's Hill was a better
position. Closer to Boston, it commanded any approach from
the south and could serve as a buffer for Bunker Hill. On the
debit side, it would be more exposed to enemy fire.
  Like all committee decisions, this one was a compromise and
as such it had weaknesses.
  Prescott occupied that part of Breed's Hill where Gridley had
laid out the lines for a square redoubt stretching 132 feet on
each side. The Colonials began digging about midnight. They
had four hours before daylight, and then the defenses could be
seen from the British warships in Boston Harbor. Presumably,
Putnam was present at the redoubt, pressing his men to dig
quickly and deep. Just the day before, he had told Ward, "Ameri-
cans are not at all afraid for their heads, though very much
afraid for their legs; if you cover them they will fight forever."
  At 3 a.m. Putnam rode back to Ward's headquarters in Cam-
bridge to seek reinforcements.
  As the digging continued on Breed's Hill, Prescott ordered
Captain Hugh Maxwell of his Massachusetts regiment to join
Captain John Nutting's detachment in Charlestown, where
they could patrol the shores to protect against British landing
parties. Prescott personally scouted the shoreline twice before


dawn. In the harbor, from north to south, lay the 14-gun sloop
Falcon, the 20-gun frigate Lively and the 20-gun Glasgow. Lead-
ing the flotilla was the formidable 64-gun ship of the line Som-
erset, a bit farther out. Hearing no activity on the ships, Prescott
returned to the Breed's Hill redoubt. Light was just beginning 
to reach the horizon.
  The 49-year-old Prescott was more than 6 feet tall and strong
of mind and body. Cast in the mold of a good officer, self-pos-
sessed with a natural air of command, he was determined yet
kind; he commanded respect but was not domineering. For his
coolness and courage under fire in the Battle of Louisbourg
during King George's War in 1745, Prescott had been offered
a regular commission in the British army but had instead re-
turned to his farm in Pepperell, Mass.
  When conflict with England appeared inevitable in 1775,
he raised a regiment of Minutemen but arrived at Concord too
late for the fighting there and at nearby Lexington. Now, as he
stood on the redoubt with the first light of dawn breaking over
the Mystic River, the guns of HMS Lively opened fire, then
strangely fell silent. Prescott used the lull to begin work on a
breastwork 100 yards long that would reach from the southeast
corner of the redoubt to the marsh below.
  While Prescott was setting his defenses, the British generals
were still bickering in Boston. Clinton proposed an immediate
attack on the Charlestown Peninsula: Howe would make a
frontal attack from the east, while Clinton with 500 men would
land just south of the Neck and behind the redoubt to cut off
Prescott's force. The other generals opposed Clinton's plan be-
cause it put the British force between the Americans on the 
peninsula and those on the mainland. Clinton later wrote that
Gage "thought himself so well informed that he would not
take any opinion of others, particularly of a man bred in the
German school, which that of America affects to despise."
  Howe then proposed that Breed's Hill be cut off with a frontal
attack by pinning down the defenders while an enveloping 
force attacked from the Mystic River to the rear. Gage approved
of Howe's plan. And that plan might have succeeded if Howe
had not chosen Moulton's Point to land his troops. The tide
there delayed his assault.
  The Colonials, tired, hungry and thirsty in the 80-degree
heat, were delighted that the British decided to delay the at-
tack. The decision gave the defenders time to continue their
preparation for Howe's command, which was led by 10 veteran
light infantry companies and 10 veteran grenadier companies.
  All in all, Howe would lead a force of 1,500 infantry and 12
guns in barges from Boston at noon, with Brig. Gen. Sir Robert
Pigot second-in-command. To be held in reserve were 700 in-
fantry of the 47th and 63rd regiments and elements of the 1st
and 2nd battalions of marines. The plan was sound and might
have been carried through, except for the six-hour delay caused
by the tide. An earlier attack would have given the landing
forces room to maneuver toward both Breed's and Bunker hills.
As it was, the delay not only gave the Americans time to im-
prove their defenses but also cost the British maneuvering room
and the ability to concentrate their attack.
  When Lively began her bombardment, Putnam awoke from
his sleep and rode off toward Breed's Hill to reinforce Prescott's
small force. Fifty-seven years old in 1775, Putnam was already
a hero of English-speaking Colonial America. Born in Salem
Village (now Danvers), Mass., Putnam was a farmboy, and
though he had little schooling, he soon learned the ways of the
woods. At the outbreak of the French and Indian War in 1754,
he joined the Connecticut forces and was made a lieutenant.
Later he joined Rogers' Rangers, named after its famous leader,
Robert Rogers. Putnam became renowned for his exploits.
Once he rescued a band of English soldiers from their Indian
captors. Another time, he escaped capture by shooting the
rapids of a dangerous river. After the war, Putnam returned to 
his farm. In 1775 he was working in his fields when he heard

enemy lines and activities such as am-
bush and cutting enemy supply lines.
During the Vietnam War that lasted until
the 1970s, the Navy SEAL units served 
with great distinction. The Communist
Viet Cong had made great strides by ter-
rorizing and murdering the South Viet-
namese. Then the SEALs, called "The 
Men With Green Faces" because of their
camouflage, turned the tables on the guer-
rillas and their North Vietnamese allies
with search-and-destroy patrols deep into
the rear areas. The SEALs terrorized the
terrorists, using tactics such as staging
raids on Viet Cong guerrilla funerals.
  The SEALs served with great distinc-
tion in "Nam" and left a record of great
successes. As most SEALs will proudly
tell you, "The United States and South
Vietnam lost their war, we won ours."
Three of the SEALs who served in Viet-
nam received the Medal of Honor.
  The men of the highly skilled special
combat force like to brag, "We can go
anywhere and do anything we wish," and
this often has proved to be the case. They
have been in the forefront of just about
every U.S. military operation since Viet-
nam. The SEAL units, which absored the 
old UDT forces, were first at Granada,
at Panama and in the Desert Storm cam-
paign. Their record is one of heroism,
pride and accomplishment. And their
museum at Fort Pierce shows the public
why they enjoy such prestige.
  With displays depicting the entire his-
tory of this special unit, the museum is lo-
cated at the center of a parklike area.
Housed there is the often deadly equipage 
the UDT/SEAL members have used in
more than half a century of service to the 
country. You will see "gadgets" used to

where torpedoes were suspected. It is not
known whether any of the prisoners were
killed as a result.
  During the 1864 bombardment of 
Charleston by Federal warships, a Con-
federate officer decided to emulate But-
ler's Dutch Gap measure. Soon 48 Union
prisoners were housed in the city within
range of their own artillery. One of them,
Brig. Gen. Charles A. Heckman, later re-
ported that Brig. Gen. John G. Foster put
an end to that caper very quickly. Wrote
Heckman, "Foster ordered down from
Johnson's Island 5 Confederate generals,
15 colonels, 15 lieutenant colonels, and
15 majors" and exposed them to fire from 
guns of Charleston's defenders.
  Although Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant
had ordered a halt to exchange of prison-
ers by that time, those sets of hostages
were soon swapped. As a result, Confed-
erate enthusiasm quickly took a new di-
rection. If hostages under fire could be ex-
changed for officers in gray, why not go
about it wholesale? Because of transpor-
tation problems, their plan to bring train-
loads of captured Federals to Charleston
proved futile and was abandoned. Union
officers at Hilton Head, however, who
knew what was brewing, failed to learn
that the scheme had been aborted.
  Almost 600 Confederate prisoners,
most of them from Johnson's Island,
Ohio, were hurriedly shipped south. Early
in September, those prisoners were put in
a stockade on Morris Island and were
guarded by black soldiers. Federal leaders
reasoned that their presence on the island
would deter Fort Sumter's gunners from
firing at fortifications on the island.
During a period of six weeks, the Con-
federate hostages dropped to the ground
many times a day when they heard the
whistling of shells. Only one hostage
died, however, and in October most of 
them were moved to safety and relative
comfort at Fort Pulaski, Ga.
  Scores of incidents caused at least 1,000
Americans to become hostages during the
Civil War, but accounts of that special
kind of warfare must be discovered one by
one in the course of research. The exist-
ing records are so scanty that in many in-
stances arrests are recorded but releases
are not. Hence, no one knows how many
of these pawns in the North/South power
struggle went to their deaths.
  It is certain, however, that Union
hostage-taking elevated 600 Confederate
officers to a unique status. Borrowing from
the lore of Balaklava, scene of Alfred
Lord Tennyson's "Charge of the Light
Brigade," Confederates labeled hostages
who survived for six weeks under con-
stant fire as "The Immortal 600." No
other band of Civil War soldiers, North
or South, fighting in major battles or
jailed as hostages, were honored by a
comparable title. ~

How thousands
of hard-charging
citizens hold
down taxes

WHAT IS THE PRICE OF CIVIC PRIDE?
How about 14.7%? But only if you carry a 
balance on your Hometown MasterCard.
  Just when you thought credit-card
companies had run out of gimmicks,
you and your neighbors have become
targets for the latest version of affinity
cards. As defined within the industry,
affinity cards are associated with
schools, clubs or charitable organiza-
tions and offer cash rebates or other ben-
efits to the sponsor-~based on the 
cardholder's spending-~rather than to 
the cardholder. The card pushers have
convinced several cash-strapped cities
that such cards can be a dependable
source of revenue to help politicians
keep a lid on taxes. These cards are not
restricted to local residents, though they
may have little appeal for nonlocals,
who can usually get better credit terms
from a standard card.
  Plano, Texas pioneered the concept
with its card in 1991 and has since been 
joined by dozens of other cities, includ-
ing Lebanon, Pa., Person County, N.C.
and Porterville, Calif. South Orange,
N.J. began offering its card last Novem-
ber. Since then Mayor William R. Cal-
abrese has become a popular guy,


entertaining hundreds of inquiries
about the program from officials in
many areas including New York City, At-
lanta and Westchester County, N.Y.
  South Orange (pop. 17,000, plus 10,000
students attending Seton Hall Univer-
sity) is a typical card-carrying commu-
nity. Thus far, there are some 800 hold-
ers of its no-fee MasterCard emblazoned
with an image of the town's Village Hall.
The interest rate on the card is 14.7%,
well below the national credit-card aver-
age (17.96%). It returns 1% of all charged
amounts to South Orange's municipal
coffers, and by late March had generated


$11,000 for the town. South Orange will
use this year's proceeds to improve the
downtown area, including refurbishing
the facades of existing stores and subsi-
dizing the rents of new merchants. The
subsidies could yield tasty dividends.
Calabrese says two bakers have applied
for the subsidy in order to move into
empty storefronts. Currently, South Or-
ange has no downtown bakery.
  South Orange's card looks like a good
deal for the town and cardholders, but
that's not always the case. So if you're
considering such a card, watch out for
these two affinity-card pitfalls:
~High rates. So far, rates on the com-
munity cards range from 11.5% to 16%.
But many other affinity cards have
rates as high as 12 points over prime,
says Robert B. McKinley, president of
RAM Research, and annual fees up to
$35. Of course, you can avoid high-
interest charges if you pay off your bal-
ance each month.
~Low sponsor income. Sponsor income
is often as low as 0.5% of your charges. So
make sure that the return your town
earns justifies the higher interest you
might pay. You could be better off "keep-
ing your old card and writing a check to
the government" if you feel like making
a contribution to civic improvement,
says Ruth Susswein, executive director
of Bankcard Holders of America. Also,
direct contributions are tax deductible;
credit-card purchases aren't.

Retirement CDs offer more than 7%-~plus headaches
If you think C-D spells "safety," you're not alone-~and don't worry, you're not Dan
Quayle. Certificates of deposit get insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corpo-
ration in accounts up to $100,000. That security blanket partly accounts for the
heightened interest in a new retirement CD being marketed by 11 banks nationwide.
Like annuities, these products earn tax-deferred returns until you retire, and then
they pay out monthly income. But unlike annuities, they are covered by the FDIC.
  Retirement CDs are offered with interest-rate periods of up to five years and
must be reinvested until your retirement date. The current rates are better than
the national CD average-~6.65% on a five-year CD. The bank currently paying the
best initial five-year rate on retirement CDs is Blackfeet National Bank in Brown-
ing, Mont. (406-338-7000) at 7.25%.
  But the retirement CD security blanket has two holes. First, the bank could es-
tablish subsequent rates below market levels. Reason: You can't transfer your de-
posit to another bank without paying taxes and penalties. Secondly, CD rates
aren't likely to allow you to live well during retirement; you probably would be
better off with a stock-based annuity.
  All told, a retirement CD is a viable option only if you're close to retirement-~say,
five years-~and you're looking for a safe place to stash your cash. -~Duff McDonald


Small-cap funds soar as tech stock rally continues


What's next for a pair


of hot MONEY picks


MONEY had earlier recommended


exceeded our target prices in a matter of 
weeks. An update:
  Wall Street Newsletter's January stock
of the month, $1.6 billion Micron Technol-
ogy (MU; NYSE; 0.3%), which was at $41.75
when we cited it, roared past our 12-
month target of $60 to trade as high as
$89 in March. Reason: Booming demand
for its specialized memory chips. Should
you hang on, especially now with the
volatile stock losing or gaining as much
as 5% in one day? Two respected technol-
ogy analysts say yes: Robert Toomey of
Piper Jaffray and Michael J. Geran of Per-
shing, a division of Donaldson Lufkin &
Jenrette. Toomey thinks Micron will
reach $100 within 12 months. Our advice:
Don't cash out, but take some profits.
  Meanwhile, February's Money Pro
Michael DiCarlo figured that $104 mil-
lion America Online (AMER; NASDAQ; no
yield), trading at $49, would hit $72 by
year-end. Instead, the nation's fastest-
growing on-line computer service 
sprinted past that target to top $83 in mid-
March. Analysts disagree on this wild
stock, however. Paul T. Sweeney of Wheat
First Butcher Singer, for example, re-
cently removed his buy rating. But Steven
Eskenazi of Alex. Brown & Sons predicts
AOL will hit $125 within 12 months. Our
advice: Sell at least enough shares to get
back your original investment.  -~S.S.


families at a level defined as adequate by the fed-
eral government. The minimum income needed to 
meet these government standards ranges from a 
mere $7,363 for singles to $14,763 for a family of 
four to $29,529 for a family of nine or more.
  Beyond these insufficient incomes, what unites
America's poor is a set of stereotyped images that
blend fact with myth. Three major assumptions
are largely true:
~ The poor are less educated than other Ameri-
cans. Only 56% of poor household heads are high
school graduates, compared with 81% of all house-
hold heads.
~ Most of the poor don't work. Only 9% of poor
working-age adults work full time, year round,
compared with 42% of all working-age adults; 40%
of the poor do work part time or part of the year,
compared with 69% of all adults.
~ Most of the poor live in single-parent house-
holds headed by women. Just over half of the poor
families (52%) in America are headed by single fe-
males, compared with only 18% of all U.S. families.
  But four other typical characterizations are
largely false:
~ The poor have too many kids. The average poor
family receiving AFDC consists of 2.9 people. The
typical American family: 3.2 people.
~ Most of the poor live in inner-city ghettos.
Only about one in eight poor Americans lives in
census tracts with poverty rates of 40% or higher.
~ Most of the poor are black. Although blacks are
overrepresented among the poor, whites make up
67% of America's poor, compared with 83% of the
overall population. Blacks, who represent 13% of
the population, make up 29% of the poor. The
black ratio has barely budged since the mid-1960s.
~ Poverty is a lifelong affliction. Studies show
that while about a third of the poor are elderly or
disabled and thus unlikely to climb out of poverty,
one of every five poor people in a given year isn't
poor the following year. Isabel V. Sawhill, a senior 
fellow at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think

kids, the poor white kids, Spanish-speak-
ing kids, and Asian kids in the U.S.-~in
the face of everything to the contrary, they
still bop and bump [snaps fingers], shout
and go to school somehow. And dare not
only to love somebody else, and even to
accept love in return, but dare to love
themselves-~that's what is most amazing.
Their optimism gives me hope.
  Q: You think the spirit of youthful opti-
mism will let today's kids rise above the
violence on the streets?
  A: Yes, and rise above the oblique and
direct negligence.
  Q: Meaning?
  A: When the human race neglects its
weaker members, when the family
neglects its weakest one-~it's the first
blow in a suicidal movement. I see the
neglect in cities around the country, in
poor white children in West Virginia and
Virginia and Kentucky-~in the big cities,
too, for that matter. I see the neglect of 
Native American children in the concen-
tration camps called reservations.
  The powerful say, "Pull yourself up by
your bootstraps." But they don't really
believe that those living on denuded
reservations, or on strip-mined hills, or
in ghettos that are destinations for drugs
from Colombia and Iraq, can somehow
pull themselves up. What they're really
saying is, "If you can, do, but if you can't,
forget it." It's the most pernicious of all
acts of segregation, because it is so subtle.
  Q: A generation after the Civil Rights


in a world that can seem so bleak?
  A: I would read. That's what I did. I
would read everybody, all the time. I
would read Dickens, and I would read
Kenzaburo Oe for his almost painful
insight. I would read James Baldwin for
his unqualified love and beautiful writing.
  Q: Young people can't read Baldwin if
they can't read, period.
  A: Well, we recover-~and this sounds
almost preachy-~by each one, teach one.
Or, each one, teach ten. Elimination of
illiteracy is as serious an issue to our his-
tory as the abolition of slavery.
  Q: The importance of literacy in schools
often gets less attention than the controversy
over prayer in schools. Should a prayerful
moment be a part of school curricula?
  A: I think so. Students who don't want
to pray don't have to and shouldn't, but a
moment of silence to focus on something
is a good thing. Those who don't want to
focus on the "unnameable" can think
about their roller skates or maybe-~
grateful surprise-~they might even
think about their homework, and the sub-
ject they're studying [laughs].
  Q: Describe how you link spirituality to
God-~why is God so crucial to your life?
  A: The most delicious piece of knowl-
edge for me is that [pauses] I am a child
of God. That is so mind-boggling, that
this "it" created everything, and I am a 
child of "it." It means I am connected to
every thing and every body.
  That's all delicious and wonderful-~

of white males, 18 to 34 years old, without college education.
Basically, a guy I know and grew up with named Bubba.
  Bubba listens to Limbaugh because Limbaugh gives him
someone to blame for the fact that Bubba is getting screwed.
He's working harder, getting paid less in constant dollars and
falling further and further behind. Not only is Bubba never
gonna be able to buy a house, he can barely afford a trailer.
Hell, he can barely afford the payments on the pickup.
  And because Bubba understands he's being shafted, even if
he doesn't know why or how or by whom, he listens to Lim-
baugh. Limbaugh offers him scapegoats. It's the "feminazis." It's
the minorities. It's the limousine liberals. It's all these people
with all these wacky social programs to help some silly, self-
proclaimed bunch of victims. Bubba feels like a victim him-
self-~and he is-~but he never got any sympathy from liberals.
  Psychologists often tell us there is a great deal of displaced
anger in our emotional lives-~your dad wallops you, but he's
too big to hit back, so you go clobber your little brother. Dis-
placed anger is also common in our political life. We see it in
this generation of young white men without much education
and very little future. This economy no longer has a place for
them. The corporations have moved their jobs to Singapore.
Unfortunately, it is Limbaugh and the Republicans who are
addressing the resentments of these folks, and aiming their
anger in the wrong direction.
  In my state, I have not seen so much hatred in politics since
the heyday of the John Birch Society in the early 1960s. Used to
be you couldn't talk politics with a conservative without his
getting all red in the face, arteries standing out in his neck,
wattles aquiver with indignation-~just like a pissed-off turkey
gobbler. And now we're seeing the same kind of anger again.

FAIRNESS & ACCURACY IN REPORTING, THE ORGANIZATION THAT
provided the absurd Limbaughisms that you see to the right,
has a sweet, gentle faith that truth will triumph in the end,
and thinks it is sufficient to point out that Limbaugh is wrong.
I say it's important to point out that he's not just wrong but
that he's ridiculous, one of the silliest people in America. Sure,
it takes your breath away when he spreads some false and
vicious rumor, such as the story that Vincent Foster's body was
actually discovered in an apartment owned by Hillary Clinton.
Or when he destroys an important lobby-control bill by falsely
claiming that it would make the average citizen subject to lob-
bying laws. Yes, that's sick and perverse.
  But it's important to show people that there is much more 
wrong with Limbaugh's thinking than just his facts. Limbaugh
specializes in ad hominem arguments, which are themselves
ridiculously easy to expose. Ted Kennedy says, "America needs
health care reform." Limbaugh replies, "Ted Kennedy is fat."
  Rush Limbaugh's pathetic abuse of logic, his absurd pompos-
ity, his relentless self-promotion, his ridiculous ego-~now
those, friends, are appropriate targets for satire.

jesse helms


  "Now wait a minute," Helms says. "The report last night was
flat-out, and I have been trying to trace it, and I am told the
Associated Press moved it and then pulled it back. I'm not sure
about that. I have only a report from the British Broadcasting
Corporation, which has various statements made by President
Zedillo, and we are attempting to ascertain what the facts are."
Something sinister is going on south of the border, Helms
seems to suggest, and he is going to get to the bottom of it.
  Moments later, his aides give reporters the BBC story, which
quotes Zedillo as saying he will accept no loan conditions that
will "undermine Mexican sovereignty." It is the kind of thing a
politician says to allay nationalist fears-~not, as Helms
implied, an outright refusal to negotiate repayment terms.
  It is a classic Helms maneuver. The Mexican loan package is
complex, but the senator has sidetracked the entire debate by
turning a nonfact into a central issue. "No conditions"
becomes a refrain throughout the hearing, creating a false
impression of Mexican deadbeats trying to get something for
nothing from American taxpayers. Weintraub spends the rest
of the morning on the defensive, refuting something that no
one had any reason to believe was true in the first place.

INNUENDO AND DIVERSION

AFTER NEARLY A QUARTER CENTURY IN THE SENATE, HELMS UNDER-
stands how a determined minority of one can influence the
national agenda. Whether he is suggesting that the comman-
der in chief needs a bodyguard or demanding that Fidel Castro
leave Cuba "in a vertical or horizontal position," Helms is
well-known for his use of innuendo and diversion. Even the
Republican Party treats him as a rogue elephant, powerful yet
dangerously erratic. But the recent GOP stampede has given
Helms a respected position from which to trumpet his bitter
opposition to abortion, gay rights, racial equality, arts funding,
and aid to what he calls "foreign rat holes."


  His agenda is driven by a lifelong opposition to democracy
and diversity. In his first months as Foreign Relations chair,
Helms called for tougher sanctions against Cuba, accused Hait-
ian President Jean Bertrand Aristide of unleashing "vigilance
committees," and moved to gut support for developing nations.
On the home front, he introduced a bill to eliminate all affir-
mative action programs, which he denounced as "reverse dis-
crimination at the hands of ruthless bureaucrats."
  How did someone so mean-spirited end up in a position to
act on his divisive politics? For the most part, Helms wins
political battles by keeping the spotlight on the morality plays
he stages. To hear conservatives tell it, Helms is a personal
friend of Jesus Christ, a populist defender of the little guy, and
a bitter opponent of big government.
  Shifting the spotlight reveals a different Helms. A former
bank lobbyist whose fundraising machine has been fined for
breaking federal campaign laws, Helms favors a big-spending,
activist government-~one that aids those in economic power.
He voted to bail out the savings and loan industry, for exam-
ple, and has seldom met a big-ticket missile system he didn't
like. By contrast, he has voted to slash school lunches for
impoverished children, medical care for disabled veterans, pre-
scription drugs for the elderly, and wages for working families
(see "On the record," below).
  "Looking at the record, people ought to understand that
Helms is not representing them on the great majority of issues,"
says Rep. Melvin Watt, a North Carolina Democrat. "They per-
ceive that he stands up for the little guy, but he really stands up
for rich people rather than poor and working-class people."

Jesse Helms likes to trumpet his support of the tobacco indus-
try and his stands against abortion, arts funding, and foreign
aid. But a review of his voting record reveals that he has also
staked out lesser-known positions that place him squarely at
odds with the needs of his constituents.
  FARMERS: Voted against soil conservation, federal crop
insurance for hail damage, and temporary protection from
foreclosures during the farm crisis. As chair of Agriculture
Committee, failed to take action on bill making it easier for
farmers to get drought relief and other disaster assistance.
  VETERANS: Voted against $80 million in pensions and
$100 million in home loans. Supported massive cuts in medical 
care for disabled veterans. Opposed job training for unem-
ployed veterans of Korea and Vietnam, and compensation for
military personnel exposed to nuclear tests.

increases in Social Security benefits. Opposed funds for Meals
on Wheels and Medicare. One of nine senators to vote against
medical coverage for prescription drugs.

  Although Schoen is aware of the
widespread skepticism that surrounds
Kombucha, he's philosophical. "We

be a lot of resistance," he says. "I

will find new energy, increased mus-
cle mass, a greater sense of well-
being, and a decrease in fat stores,
provided this routine is supported by
a proper nutrition plan. The "peaked-
out" exerciser will find a sense of reju-
venation, an enhanced energy, and
depending on individual statistics, a
change in muscle fiber size or distrib-
ution. Some people might find that
their muscle size decreases, although
once they complete this routine and
return to a regular training regimen,
their gains will come quickly and sub-

the nutrition is in order. It allows the
metabolism to readjust, renewing a 
"stale" physiology. It allows muscles
to recuperate, joints to rest and heal,
and the overall body chemistry to
become healthful and empowering. I
call this routine The Four-Week

there is still an aspect of individuality

dence has loads of room) and forbid-
ding them to have daily Mass. Doubt-
less in the old days many of Vietnam's
Catholic elite might have deserved to
be brought down a peg or two. Today, 
however, the Church is completely dis-
possessed and yet even more of a chal-
lenge to the government.
  St. Joseph's Cathedral tells the tale
in sad grey walls representing fifty
years of neglect. Mass is permitted
only twice a day, at 5:30 A.M. and P.M.,
but the Sunday service we attended
was packed, and the papers reported
that on Christmas Eve there were
overflow crowds. As I pass the statue
of Our Lady in its very sorry state, I
nonetheless suspect that for all its tri-
als the Cross will remain in Vietnam
long after the hammer and sickle have
become a footnote.
  On my last day here, I make the
round of the art galleries. In Hong
Kong, where I live, Vietnamese artists
are quite popular and the prices have
escalated accordingly. Most prominent
of these is the late Bui Xuan Phai,
whose street scenes of Hanoi suggest
Degas and whose works go for about
three times those of any other Viet-
namese artist. Alas, the world's discov-
ery of Vietnamese art is having two
economic consequences. The first is a
booming business in fake Phais; he
seems to have produced more in the 7
years after he died than in the 67
years he was alive. The other is an ex-
plosion of bad art. In a nation where
average annual income is $210 and a 
painting can easily fetch $300, more
and more people are discovering the in-
ner artist in themselves.
  In an upstairs gallery, the young
women all speak excellent English. We
chat about America and the opportuni-
ties in Vietnam these days, and as they 
roll up a purchase, I decide to ask
about the imprisoned Dr. Que.
  After conferring with one another in
Vietnamese, they turn to me. "He is in-
volved with democracy and human
rights?" one asks.
  I admitted this was so.
  "That is not a good thing to be in-
volved in here."
  Indeed.

cover them in the much broader realm
of inquiry that we might call meta-
physics. Of course, there is something
in the insights thus offered; it is simply
the claim of their omnicompetence that
looks like overkill. Characteristically,
such schemes present a simple and ap-
pealing pattern of explanation which
seems flexible enough to fit many
cases. Evolution through the competi-
tion to survive is like that; so is the
Hegelian dialectic of thesis and an-
tithesis leading to synthesis. Once one
has got the hang of such a pattern, it is
rather easy to twist things into that
pleasing shape. Once one knows that
survival value is the key, then of
course there must be a lot of survival
value around. Ideas become self-fulfill-
ing. This leads to those conjectured
tales which Stephen Jay Gould has


pious tales to the effect that all that
happens is absolutely, and in an un-
qualified way, for the best. The real
world is more complicated, perplexing,
and interesting than any of these facile
accounts.
  Dennett is far too clever to fall for
the grosser forms of reductionism. He
calls them "greedy reductionism" and
chides the likes of B. F. Skinner and
Edward O. Wilson for being too crude
in their attempts at explanation. His
own reductionism is much more so-
phisticated. One of Dennett's gifts is
the ability to invent lively and tenden-
tious terminology and stories in order
to back up his line of argument. He


characterizes the battle over reduction-
ism as being "cranes" versus "sky-
hooks." The cranes are built from be-
low and they represent the complexity
and novelty that arise from the inter-
play of constituent bits and pieces, the
combined effects of many elementary
events. The skyhooks are to do duty as
representatives of organizing princi-
ples or acts of a holistic character,
whose nature and consequences will
not be discernible if we restrict our-
selves to a reductionist account. Of
course the name is chosen to suggest
that such top-down concepts are of an
implausible or frankly fabulous char-
acter. "Skyhooks are miraculous lift-
ers, unsupported and insupportable.
Cranes are no less excellent as lifters,
and they have the decided advantage
of being real." This is clever debating
technique but it is not the way to settle
a serious issue. Skyhooks are not as
unanchored as Dennett would have us
think.
  One of the serious questions that
many physical scientists wish to ask
about a purely Darwinian account of
the evolution of life is whether there
has been adequate time available to
accommodate the amazing variety and
complexity of change involved. Three
to four billion years may seem a long
period, but astonishing things have to
have happened, not least in the rapid
development of the hominid brain in 
the space of only a few million years. Is
the patient accumulation and sifting of
small genetic differences sufficient to
accomplish this? Those who ask the
question are not querying the idea that
natural selection has a role to play, but
they simply ask whether it is by itself
totally adequate as an explanation.
The questioners are not looking for a
gap into which to insert the finger of
divine intervention, but they may just
be seeking a more comprehensive and
persuasive scientific account. People
like Paul Davies (The Cosmic Blue-
print) are very impressed with the re-
markable drive to complexity present
in cosmic history. Dennett occasionally
refers to this time-scale problem, but it
seems that neither he nor any other
evolutionary reductionist is able to of-
fer a convincing answer to it.
  It seems entirely conceivable that
there are holistic laws of nature, cur-
rently unknown but in principle scien-
tifically discoverable, which drive the
"optimistic arrow" of increasingly fruit-
ful development. Dennett's own mode


by Sir Walter Scott is good enough for
the movies; why so few of his fictions
have been filmed remains a mystery.
Nor is this movie based on his novel;
rather, on a scenario by Alan Sharp, a
much lesser Scot. I recall such annoy-
ing screenplays of his as those for The
Hired Hand and especially Night
Moves, not to mention his award-win-
ning novel, the dreary A Green Tree in 
Gedde. He is, however, literate, and
not the typical Hollywood dunderhead;
for a historical adventure movie that
may be enough.
  Rob Roy is basically a British film,
shot on location in Scotland; that is
what saves it. First, the British actors,
such as John Hurt as the nasty Mont-
rose, Brian Cox as the Machiavellian
Killearn, and Andrew Keir as the sat-
urnine Argyll. Next, the gorgeous loca-
tions (I was tempted to write "loch-
ations"), compellingly shot by the
German cinematographer Karl Walter
Lindenlaub in Eastmancolor. Put Scot-
land and good color photography to-
gether and you have a marriage made
in Heaven. For it is not lush tropical
locales that come off best on color film;
they tend to look a bit gaudy, even
stagey. But take the chaste, strikingly
muted yet subtly varied colors of
Scotland, and film becomes seemingly
filmy, as if shot through a scrim, but
also with a certain patina, or perhaps a
sense of watercolors rather than oils,
insinuating rather than aggressive. It
is-~I cannot avoid synaesthesia-~in-
cantatory on the eye.
  Then, too, the stars. As the rebel-
lious hero Robert Roy MacGregor,
there is the dashing Irishman Liam
Neeson, in kilts for the first time,
something to thrill all lassies-~the
wee, the bonny, and even the Come


tious aural background; and the very
bit players and authentic extras con-
tribute handsomely to the epic sweep.
Under Michael Caton-Jones's pawky
direction, even Eric Stoltz manages to 
come across as a proper clansman.
Only one thing jars. The villain, a Brit-
ish fop and swordsman played with
wonderful loathsomeness by Tim Roth,
is shown as a deadly fencer under his
foppish exterior. Nevertheless, in the
climactic duel, Roth is so puny com-
pared to Neeson, you think the latter
could have stretched out one bare,
swordless arm and kept him at bay.
  Otherwise, though, the film fulfills
the modest expectations we have from
the genre; perhaps even a wee bit
more. I just wish it would not repre-
sent Scotland as a warm, sunny coun-
try; there is only so much disbelief a
body can suspend. ~


has given us a closer approximation of
what music sounded like from the six-
teenth century forward. (This has also
given us aper~us on Haydn and
Mozart, and opened up through the
recordings of Paul Badura-Skoda many
of the once "impossible" pages of the
last Beethoven piano sonatas.) Yet
"Baroque" is far from homogeneous.
Palestrina moves along more or less on
one level of meaning and involvement,
and Bach never attained the musical
depths and heights of Monteverdi. If
this is heresy, so be it.
  But there is corroboration in a num-
ber of new recordings, which I believe
bear me out. Baroque: Palestrina, Mon-
teverdi, Choral Works (EMI Classics)
offers the Choir of King's College,
Cambridge, the Early Music Consort of
London, and resonant soloists, per-
forming both Palestrina's Missa Papae
Marcelli and extracts from Monte-
verdi's Vespro della Beata Vergine. The
truncated version of the Vespro hardly
compares with the full work, which
some time back was issued by the New
London Consort on l'Oiseau Lyre,
though it contains the magnificent
Magnificat. Yet it is sufficient to show
how far Monteverdi had advanced both 
the ars musica, technically speaking,
and the content of music, as well as its

TECHNOLOGY

Small Business
Meets The Internet

The publisher of a small newsletter is
demonstrating that cyberspace has
something to offer small-business own-
ers-~and not just those who are techno-
logically advanced.
  Jo Roberts of Diamond Springs,
Calif., recently began her first foray
onto the Internet by advertising her Do
You Know Newsletter, a collection of
practical ideas and information on mat-
ters pertaining to the home. Roberts,
who only recently traded her electric
typewriter for a personal computer, is
hoping to attract cyberspace audiences
to her fledgling publication without
spending much money. Her newsletter
is available on the World Wide Web, an
information system that links sites 
across the Internet.
  In the past, collecting money has
been a barrier for small businesses
wanting to sell products electronically.
Credit-card transactions require a
business to have a hard-to-get credit


environmental and health standards.
British real-estate agents use the ratings
to promote properties that they are
selling. In the United States, the Green
Building Council, a nonprofit trade associ-
ation in Bethesda, Md., has just launched
a voluntary rating system for commercial
buildings. For information, call the coun-
cil at (301) 657-3469.
  Worldwatch suggests these strategies:
  ~ Exploit natural forces such as sun
and wind. Because half of the energy used
to make and run buildings goes to heat-
ing, ventilation, and lighting, designs that
draw the maximum benefit from natural
forces are the best way to save money and
reduce environmental impact. Planting
trees near buildings can cut cooling needs


up to 30 percent, according to the report.
  ~ Select efficient appliances and cli-
mate-control systems, which cost more
initially but save money in the long run. A
residential development in Texas cut
household utility bills by an estimated
$450 a year by using efficient appliances
and solar heating, which added about $156
a year to mortgage payments.
  ~ Use construction materials that don't
emit toxins or require much transporta-
tion or processing. Use materials that are
renewable, recyclable, or both.

Creditors Gain Some Benefits
The bankruptcy-reform law also
strengthens the ability of creditors to
recover goods they have sold to insolvent
businesses or individuals.
  Previously, a seller could reclaim mer-
chandise from an insolvent debtor only by
making the request within 10 days after
the debtor received it.
  The new law retains the 10-day dead-
line but gives the seller 10 more days to 
request the goods if the original deadline
occurs after the bankruptcy case starts.

Apart from putting numerous bank-
ruptcy-code changes in place, the
new law also calls for efforts to
consider further modifications.
The reform measure proposes a nine-
member commission to study additional
problems with the code and recommend
more changes.
  Gerdano says the commission itself
may be one of the most important changes
in the new law. "Additional recommenda-
tions are still needed to correct what
doesn't work anymore," he says.
  For now, however, bankruptcy attor-
neys say the recently enacted changes are
a step in the right direction.  ~


Which Chapter Is For You?


If your company is approaching insol-
vency, it may help to know more about the
various bankruptcy options that are avail-
able to you.
  Here are brief descriptions of three key
forms of bankruptcy:

Chapter 7
Individuals, sole proprietors, and corpo-
rations can use this provision to liquidate
assets and get out of debt. It requires the
sale of certain assets to satisfy the claims
of creditors.
  "Chapter 7 may be right for you if you 
have little property and are not concerned
with saving a large asset, such as a house,
from creditors," says Alice Griffin, author
of Personal Bankruptcy, What You
Should Know, a 141-page book from
Cakewalk Press, New York.


Chapter 11
Business people use this option to reor-
ganize a company and continue to operate
it. A major reason for reorganization via
Chapter 11 is that the value of the
business in operation is greater than the
value of its assets if they were to be sold.

Chapter 13
This method may be right for you if you 
have steady employment, including in-
come from an unincorporated business,
and you want to keep a valuable asset,
such as your home, says Griffin. Under
Chapter 13, debtors repay creditors in
installments over three to five years.
During that time, creditors may not start
or continue collection efforts. The new law
raises the debt limit in Chapter 13 to $1
million from $450,000.


they will actually save on compliance
costs. And with the program in its infancy,
some are still struggling to adapt to a
whole new way of doing things.
  For example, Cindy Deleo says manag-
ers at the tile company have had a tough
time fully understanding the new system of
regulation and have had to hire consultants
to help them sort out its ramifications.
  Although some companies already have
entered the "smog market" to buy or sell
credits through brokers, overall demand for
credits is not high, and so prices are low.
The largest transaction to date occurred in
June, when a large glass company bought 
credits to emit about 3 million pounds of
nitrogen oxides; it paid about 37 cents per
pound. Prices are expected to rise over the
next few years as the number of credits
allocated by regulators drops, says Anupom
Ganguli, planning and rules manager of the
air quality management district.
  Last July, when business increased dra-
matically at Western Metal Decorating Co.,
the firm decided to buy nitrogen-oxides
emissions credits. The 90-employee com-
pany, based in Cucamonga, "bakes" paint
onto metal cans for H.J. Heinz Co. and
other food processors.
  The ceiling on Western Metal's emissions
will drop in stages each year-~from 9,620
pounds last year to 1,836 pounds by 2003.


Angeles Federation of Labor, for example,
has expressed concern that when the prices
of pollution credits rise, some small compa-
nies may sell their credits and use the
proceeds to move operations to Mexico,
where environmental regulations are less
stringent.
  Many environmental groups have re-
served judgment of the program, but a few
are fighting it.
  One group, San Francisco-based Citizens
for a Better Environment, sued the air
quality management district over the mat-
ter last June in a state court. The organiza-
tion contends in the suit that regulators
doled out too many credits for the first few
years of RECLAIM and that the fledgling
free-enterprise program won't adequately
reduce pollution. "What we're alleging is
that RECLAIM is less effective than the
system it replaced," says Richard Drury,
staff attorney for the group.
  Nevertheless, supporters of the concept
think it will work, although it may need to
be reviewed and improved upon over time.
  California regulator Ganguli says the
free-market experiment will at least give
companies a chance to prove what they have
argued for years: that factory managers,
not government regulators, are best-
equipped to find the most effective ways to
cut pollution at their operations. ~

TRB ~~
FROM WASHINGTON

Ruse you can use

When Rupert Murdoch decides to
finance a made-for-TV version of The
Newt Gingrich Story, you can bet that one
dramatic scene will be the House leader-
ship meeting at which Gingrich commits
the Republicans to balancing the budget
by 2002. As described breathlessly by
Paul Gigot of The Wall Street Journal, the
Republicans' commander was faced with
demoralization among his troops. John
Kasich, the chairman of the House Bud-
get Committee, wanted to back off the
balanced-budget promise:

  When had this goal ever been "written in
stone"? he wanted to know.
  Whereupon Speaker Newt Gingrich imme-
diately piped up: "I move that we write it in
stone. Do I hear a second?"
  The second was heard, the mock motion
carried, and that's the last time John Kasich
has mused about not balancing the budget.

  More than the poll-driven Contract
with America, the Republicans' balanced-
budget promise has convinced many
otherwise levelheaded conservatives
that Gingrich is an American Thatcher
a revolutionary leader dedicated to dis-
solving the "bureaucratic welfare state."
The "fact that Mr. Gingrich didn't know 
how to make the numbers add up him-
self didn't seem to matter," David Rogers
and Gerald Seib of the Journal reported.
Great leaders take on great challenges,
after all. They don't necessarily bother
with annoying details: "In one stroke, the
speaker had plunged himself-~and his
party-~into a commitment that has huge
ramifications...."
  Those of us who suspect that Gingrich
is something less than a world-historical
figure are understandably skeptical. To
meet their budget goal, we note, the
Republicans must cut the deficit by
$1.3 trillion over seven years. That's twice
as big as the cut in President Clinton's
1993 budget plan. And Clinton did more
than half of his deficit-reducing with tax
increases. The Republicans say they will
do it with spending cuts alone-~indeed,
while lowering taxes, and without touch-


ing Social Security. We skeptics have one
question: How are they going to weasel
out of this bind?
  It's a good question to ask, even if you
sympathize with the GOP's zero-deficit
goal. Especially if you sympathize with it,
actually, since recognizing potential bud-
get scams is the first step to stopping
them. There are, it turns out, plenty of
ways to pretend to balance the budget
without really doing it. Here's a sampler:
  Time-shifting: Want to show no deficit
in 2002? Push losses back to 2003. The 
House Republicans' tax proposals, for 
example, are heavily "back-loaded,"
meaning their costs balloon over time.
True, it will be hard to put off the day of
reckoning for a full seven years-~one
reason Kasich got cold feet. But some
GOP tax breaks actually generate


money for a few years before


2002 target? Better yet, have
the government sell a bunch of
assets-~broadcast frequencies, loan port-
folios-~just in time to eliminate the
deficit for a year.
  Black boxes: "We have decided that
we're taking Medicare into a separate
box," Gingrich announced recently. "It
should not be entangled in the budget
debate." The speaker was clearly up to
some trickery, but nobody in Washing-
ton could figure out quite what. The
Medicare trust fund is scheduled to lose
$161 billion between now and 2002. Was
Gingrich saying he was going to treat this
as "off budget"-~that he would only bal-
ance the budget before counting the
trust fund losses? That was too big a scam
even for Gingrich. Republicans could
hardly exclude Medicare, just because it
is generating losses, while counting Social
Security, which is currently generating
large surpluses. It's easy to balance a 
budget if you simply don't count any pro-
gram that loses money.
  But the "separate box" idea suggests a
less blatant, yet equally effective, ruse.
Republicans could note that the trust
fund is going broke, then call for a com-
mission to "reinvent" the program and
save, say, $250 billion over seven years.
("Reinvention" is to Gingrich what
"waste, fraud and abuse" was to Reagan,
a way to pretend that huge budget cuts
can be achieved without actually hurting
anyone.)
  Who could object if this Medicare
commission-~which Senator Bob Dole
has already called for-~takes a year or


two to come up with its recommenda-
tions? In the meantime, the Republicans
can count the $250 billion in projected 
savings as part of their bold budget plan.
  Entitlement caps: How can Republicans
appear to control entitlement programs
other than Medicare-~programs such as
Medicaid, farm subsidies, civil service
and military pensions? Simple. Cap 
them. Write a law saying their cost shall
be held to-~well, you can really fill in any
number you want. If costs exceed that
level, decree that the requisite amount
will automatically be "sequestered."
Sound familiar? This is the mechanism
that the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings bill
tried to use to control the budget. The
approach failed, of course, because when
the budget targets were breached and
the time came for a big sequester,

are anti-Mexican or related to "hate." The
article, instead, suggests hypocrisy in be-
ing pro-NAFTA and anti-bailout.
  As I understand it, Phil Gramm and Al
D'Amato are making the case that a few
billion dollars will mainly help foreign
investors in Mexican debt instruments
and not Mexicans. I have read accounts
that report that what money has gone in
since the most recent peso drop has been
snatched out just as fast by investors in
order to close out their positions. The
dollar amount may be enough to help
investors, but the fundamentals of the
Mexican economy and currency man-
agement will overwhelm our cash ship-
ment and dictate Mexican well-being.
Gramm and D'Amato are also making
the point that bailing out what should be
high-risk investments reduces the associ-
ated risk, encourages further high-
default investment and therefore the
likelihood of more bailouts.
  There may be intelligent counterpoint
to these arguments. Until then, I remain
unconvinced by Wright. Furthermore, it


their paternalistic pockets. Secondly, who else could
have bid for the loot? Foreigners would have been wary
of such massive investment in such an unstable country,
if indeed they had been allowed to buy up so much of 
Russia. And the average Ivan had neither the resources
nor the technical competence to take over large-scale
state property.
  In other words, given the Soviet heritage, to create
a "capitalism" that would not be nomenklatura-
dominated was structurally unfeasible. Speed, moreover, 
even at the cost of major compromises with the old
order, was vital if there was to be any transition at all.
The evidence is now overwhelming that in a "gradual"
transition from Communism the nomenklatura opts


economy is to revive. As a sign of this new restraint, after
the ruble's crash last October, the government finally
replaced the spendthrift Viktor Gerashchenko as direc-
tor of the Central Bank with the competent technician,
Tatiana Paramonova.
  The prospect of an upturn is all the more plausible
since it is clear that a lot of people are getting rich in
Russia. Though we hear much of the new indigence of
the population, of retirement pensions destroyed and
of 30 percent of the nation living below the poverty
line, it is also true that New Russians are successful 
entrepreneurs. Like erstwhile petro-Arabs, they have
become lavish spenders in the world's luxury spots from 
the Riviera to California. In 1994 $20 billion in new

realities by imposing meaning on other-
wise meaningless things. Thus we have
language and money and weddings and
academic gowns and guest passes. The
world bifurcates into the created and
the uncreated, though there cannot be
the former without the latter.
  But isn't all this obvious, even banal?
Not banal enough, in our post-post-
structuralist intellectual life. I wonder if
Searle would have written this book were
it not for the polemical purpose of refut-
ing certain fashionable doctrines to the
effect that reality itself is a construction
from human institutions; and yet, even if
Searle's book may be low on primary


philosophical thrills, it is bursting with
plain and necessary right-headedness.
He has performed a genuine service in
bringing his rigor to bear on the lazy 
and pernicious relativism latent in the
idea that reality is just what we humans
choose it to be. The Construction of Social
Reality might not exist if it were not for
the bad ideas of other people, but there
are many important books about which
that may be said.

COLIN MCGINN is professor of philoso-
phy at Rutgers University and the author

The Limits of Inquiry (Blackwell).


It's not easy to pick up a book
about the impending death of
a practice once thought to be
at the heart of the well-lived
life. I mean the practice of reading, espe-
cially the kind of serious reading we were
taught was not only the means to an edu-
cation, but its self-delighting end. And
though it may be comforting to hear
one's twilight fears echoed and elabo-
rated by someone so steadily persua-
sive as Sven Birkerts, it's hard to shake
the feeling that his book would more
profitably sit in the hands of those
who are least likely to turn to it: the grow-
ing number of "wired" citizens who con-
sider books, and book-reading, quaint
atavisms in the evolution of information
technology. This book's message is apt to
seem to them as distant as its medium.
  The medium in this case is the old-
fashioned discursive essay-~personal, re-
flective, edifying and (true to the title of
the collection) elegiac. Through the fif-
teen essays gathered here, two themes 
march solemnly, purposefully and often
hand in hand. The first is that the read-
ing of good books is an essential, and
essentializing, activity: that it deepens
and individualizes us, cultivates our in-
wardness and even our souls. The second
is that the act of reading-~specifically,
the serious and solitary engagement with
works of great literature-~is endangered 
by the rise and expansion of the modern
technology of electronic "interactivity."


  Few readers will have difficulty em-
bracing the first theme. Indeed, as read-
ers, they will have a harder time believ-
ing that anyone who doesn't engage
with great books can possess a soul
worth wondering about. This readerly
species of hubris in fact merits consid-
eration, not least because it persists
despite the efforts of some of the more
canny modernist writers to challenge its
blinkered arrogance. Joyce's Leopold
Bloom is a perfect case in point. This
supreme creature of the Dublin middle
class, this urban stroller and relisher of
the everyday, is not a reader in the sense
Birkerts would understand. That is,
Bloom would never sit down of an
evening with a novel by Flaubert; a line
from Yeats would probably baffle him.
Yet Joyce makes it abundantly clear-~
it is practically the point of his novel-~
that Bloom, in another sense, is a pro-
foundly discerning reader of the world's
manifold and seemingly random signs,
whether they be details from ephemeral
newspaper stories or advertising slogans,
the muttered words of his fellow citi-
zens, or the shifting moods of his wife.
That a writer of such exquisitely man-
darin learning could have arrived at so
democratic an appreciation of the inte-
rior life of an extraordinary ordinary
man is one of the marvels of Ulysses.
  The matter of Bloom is not tangential
to Birkerts's larger argument, as Birkerts
well knows. One of his essays explicitly


takes on the charge that literary sensi-
bility (or what Birkerts calls "coherent
inwardness") is no more than an elitist
affectation. To some extent, though, all
of the essays here force one to ask
whether "people of the book" are in-
deed guardians of the sacred and the
true, or just well-intentioned but ulti-
mately misguided idolaters who mistake
the vessel for the contents in their ef-
forts to perpetuate a cult of esotericism,
high learning, difficulty.

  Birkerts makes a good case
against the second con-
clusion and in favor of the 
broadest, most democrat-
ic claims of a literary education. He
does so partly through a sympathetic
autobiographia literaria that tells how he
came to books and how his life has
been shaped in service to them. Birk-
erts's literary education had a very
unstuffy, American quality-~after col-
lege, he supported himself by working 
in bookstores, fighting off depression
and self-doubt with voracious reading-~
and the self-mocking candor with 
which he describes himself is winning.
"I saw my role," he writes of his book-
store years, "as quasi-priestly: I was 
channeling the nourishing word to the
people who wanted it most. I had to 
feel that because, otherwise, I was just
putting in time at a low-paying retail
job, not at all ministering to the life of
the culture or moving along a worthy
career path."
  But even while the priestly metaphor
is ironic here, it hints at a somewhat less
democratic notion of the literary life.
Simply put, Birkerts believes that litera-
ture has a salvific purpose, though salva-
tion, to him, is very much a worldly mat-
ter: its other name is individuality. We
go to serious reading, Birkerts suggests,
out of a sense of self-insufficiency (a sec-
ular variant, one might say, of Original
Sin): "To open a book voluntarily is at
some level to remark the insufficiency
either of one's life or of one's orienta-
tion toward it." And what do readers
accomplish in reading? Typically, Birk-
erts explains, they establish their "in-
wardness, the more reflective compo-
nent of their self, in the space that read-
ing opened up." That space is more tem-
poral than physical-~not the time of 
sequential, measurable units but time
beyond time, in which the reader can
see that, "God or no God, life has a uni-
tary pattern inscribed within it, a pat-
tern that we could discern for ourselves
if we could somehow lay the whole of
our experience out like a map."
  If such arguments have a familiar ring,
it is because Birkerts embraces the
Arnoldian ideal of art as the last stay
against anarchy, the noble stand-in for


Leven-~himself a former shrink-~has taken 
a heavy conceit and lightened it into com-
edy, which is what it deserves. Brando en-
joys himself hugely, especially in his scenes
with Faye Dunaway, who plays his wife. In
defiance of the laws of gravity, the big man
rises to the occasion and lifts the movie with
him.-~A.L. (4/10/95) (Village Theatre VII,
Cinema 3rd Avenue, and Lincoln Square....
~ Criterion Center; through May 18.)
DREAMING OF RITA-~In Jon Lindstrom's com-
edy, Per Oscarsson is a widower in search of
the love of his youth, a Rita Hayworth look-
alike. Written by the director and Rita
Holst. In Swedish. (Quad Cinema.)
THE ENGLISHMAN WHO WENT UP A HILL BUT CAME
DOWN A MOUNTAIN-~Hugh Grant, who became 
a romantic icon with "Four Weddings and a 
Funeral," again unleashes his bashful-boy
smile and cloaks himself in an aura of


modest, befuddled sincerity. But the
illusion of ease has vanished, and 
his charm has gone with it. Christo-
pher Monger, the writer and direc-
tor, works just as strenuously to en-
chant us, and, like the star, he
overtaxes his lightweight virtues. For
a while, this slight anecdote about a
Welsh village during the First World
War seems an amiable anachro-
nism-~a throwback to the eccentric-
community formula of Ealing com-
edy. But Monger tries to pile more
meaning onto his story than its frag-
ile structure can support, and he 
buries the small good thing he started
out with. Also with Colm Meaney,
Ian McNeice, Kenneth Griffith, and
Tara FitzGerald.-~T.R. (5/15/95)

ERMO-~A Chinese peasant (Alia) takes a 
second job, has an affair with her neigh-
bor, and sells her blood, all in her
quest to buy the biggest TV in the
village. Directed by Zhou Xiaowen. In
Mandarin. (Lincoln Plaza Cinemas.)
ETERNITY / IS THAT ALL THERE IS?-~Two docu-
mentaries. The first, directed by Law-
rence Johnston, concerns Arthur Stace,
who spent forty years writing the
word "eternity" in chalk on the streets
of Sydney. The second is Lindsay An-
derson's last film, a self-portrait he
directed for BBC Scotland. (Film Fo-
rum; through May 23.)
FRENCH KISS-~Meg Ryan, Timothy Hutton,
and Kevin Kline in a film by Lawrence
Kasdan. (Reviewed this week in The 
Current Cinema.) (Movieland 8th 
Street Triplex, Murray Hill Cinemas,
Gotham Cinema, Orpheum VII, Chel-
sea Cinemas, Regency, and Embassy.)
FRIDAY-~Ice Cube stars in a comedy he


co-wrote (with D.J. Pooh) about life in South
Central Los Angeles. With Chris Tucker. Di-
rected by Gary Gray. (Movieland 8th Street
Triplex, 19th Street East 6, Gemini, 86th
Street East Twin, 84th Street Sixplex, and

GORDY-~Country-music singer Doug Stone stars
in a family comedy about a piglet who sets
out to save his parents and siblings from
the slaughterhouse and becomes a national
celebrity. With Kristy Young, Michael Roe-
scher, and Tom Lester. Directed by Mark
Lewis. (Village East Cinemas, First & 62nd
Cinemas, East 85th Street, 23rd St. West
Triplex, and Lincoln Square.)
JEFFERSON IN PARIS-~The subject of Thomas Jef-
ferson's five years as ambassador to France
is so rich and engaging that it should be
impossible to make a dull film about it;
nevertheless, the producing and directing
team of Ismail Merchant and James Ivory
have pulled it off. The period detail is numb-
ing, and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala's script sounds
like a stash of letters being read aloud.
Nothing sparks between Nick Nolte, as Jef-
ferson, and Greta Scacchi, as the married
woman with whom he is in love, and the
high point of his ardor for the black maid


with whom he is alleged to have had an
affair (Thandie Newton) is the furtive un-
buckling of a shoe. When Gwyneth Paltrow,
who plays Jefferson's impatient daughter, tears
off her fancy wig and stuffs it into a vase,
we know just how she feels.-~A.L. (Paris.)
KISS OF DEATH-~Barbet Schroeder's workman-
like remake of the 1947 crime melodrama,
about the perils of a small-time New York
crook who becomes a stool pigeon. Despite a
wonderful cast-~which includes David Ca-
ruso (as the sensitive squealer), Helen Hunt,
Samuel L. Jackson, and Stanley Tucci-~and
a crafty, low-key screenplay by Richard
Price, the picture feels a little lethargic.
Only Nicolas Cage, who plays the chief vil-
lain-~a positive-thinking, bodybuilding thug
named Little Junior-~manages to dispel the
over-all air of weary professionalism.-~T.R.
(5/1/95) (Murray Hill Cinemas, First & 62nd


Cinemas, Park & 86th Street Cinemas, Wa-
verly, Chelsea Cinemas, Lincoln Square,
Olympia, and Criterion Center.)
A LITTLE PRINCESS-~A wealthy Anglo-Indian ten-
year-old (Liesel Matthews) is sent away to
the strict Miss Minchin's School for Girls
when her father (Liam Cunningham) is
called up to fight in the First World War.
With Eleanor Bron as Miss Minchin. Di-
rected by Alfonso Cuar~~n. Written by Rich-
ard LaGravenese and Elizabeth Chandler,
based on Frances Hodgson Burnett's 1888
novel, "Sara Crewe." (Gemini.... ~ Village
Theatre VII, Orpheum VII, 84th Street Six-
plex, and Criterion Center; starting May 19.)
MY FAMILY-~Like Gregory Nava's first feature,
"El Norte," this portrait of three generations
of a Mexican-American clan in East Los
Angeles occasionally goes haywire on senti-
ment. The big-canvas approach works best
at capturing the way large immigrant fami-
lies produce utterly disparate people who are
nevertheless helplessly connected. Though
the supporting cast is spotty, Eduardo Lopez
Rojas is exceptionally fine as the patriarch,
a befuddled and repressed optimist; Esai
Morales smolders charismatically as his luck-
less son; and Jimmy Smits, playing an ex-


con, overcomes some implausible dialogue
to get at the sweetness and hurt underneath
his macho shell. With Edward James Olmos.
Written by Nava and Anna Thomas.-~S.K.
(Village East Cinemas, 19th Street East 6,
New York Twin, Orpheum VII, Lincoln Square,
and Criterion Center.)
NINA TAKES A LOVER-~In writer-director Alan Ja-
cobs' feature-film d~~but, a San Francisco jour-
nalist (Michael O'Keefe) working on a story
about marriage encounters a housewife (Laura
San Giacomo) who is having an affair with a
Welsh photographer (Paul Rhys). (Lincoln
Square.)
PANTHER-~A fascinating, completely hysterical
dramatization of the founding and the de-
mise of the Black Panthers movement. Ka-
deem Hardison plays Judge, a catatonic 
Vietnam vet who is singled out as a confidant
by Bobby Seale (Courtney B. Vance) and


Huey Newton (Marcus Chong) and as a
potential informant by an F.B.I. agent
(Joe Don Baker), and who functions as
a Nick Carraway-style ambivalent ob-
server. The father-and-son team of
Melvin (writer) and Mario (director)
Van Peebles throws in everything plus
ten kitchen sinks: real and simulated
documentary footage, gratuitous punches
and gunshots in glorious surround-
sound, buddy-movie elements in the
interaction of Bobby and Huey. By the
end, Judge is an action hero dodging 
pigs and revolutionary hotheads-~as well
as the mob, the F.B.I., and a drug-
dealing black Judas, who have con-
spired to annihilate the Panthers by
flooding the ghetto with heroin. With
Dick Gregory as a gentle minister, An-
thony Griffith as Eldridge Cleaver, and
the fresh young Wesley Jonathan as
Little Bobby Hutton; Mario Van Pee-
bles appears in a rally scene as Stokely
Carmichael.-~S.K. (Village Theatre VII,
19th Street East 6, 34th Street Show-
place, New York Twin, Orpheum VII,
84th Street Sixplex, and Astor Plaza.)
THE PEREZ FAMILY-~Juan Perez (Alfred Mo-
lina), a newly released Cuban political
prisoner on his way to Miami to find
Carmela Perez (Anjelica Huston), the wife
he hasn't seen for twenty years, is iden-
tified through a clerical error as the
husband of a passionate young refugee
named Dottie Perez (Marisa Tomei). Di-
rected by Mira Nair ("Mississippi Ma-
sala," "Salaam Bombay!"). Written by
Robin Swicord, from Christine Bell's 1991
novel. (Village Theatre VII, First & 62nd
Cinemas, Chelsea Cinemas, Lincoln
Square, and Embassy.)
PICTURE BRIDE-~A nice-looking, earnest fem-
inist lesson, about a young Japanese
woman (Youki Kudoh) who enters into


an arranged marriage with a sugarcane
cutter (Akira Takayama) in Hawaii in 1918.
The picture examines the role of the Japa-
nese contract laborers in the early part of
this century and the limited choices avail-
able to the women who joined them. Al-
though the  director, Kayo Hatta, and her
co-writer (and sister), Mari Hatta, have
added some Hawaiian folklore and a little
Magic Realism, the characters are stereo-
typed composites of sociohistorical forces.
Even as history, though, this film fails to 
answer the most basic question: what was it
like to bend over all day in a hot field
cutting sugarcane? In Japanese and En-
glish.-~S.K. (Angelika Film Center and 68th
St. Playhouse.)
ROB ROY-~Michael Caton-Jones's film about the
eighteenth-century Scottish outlaw Robert 
MacGregor uneasily straddles the line be-
tween swashbuckler and prestige picture. In
Alan Sharp's screenplay, Rob (Liam Neeson)
is a rugged, principled man at war with
artful English fops (Tim Roth and John Hurt).
This should make for rousing spectacle, but
somehow it doesn't. With Jessica Lange as
the hero's loyal wife, the picture is actually
more effective as a conjugal-love story than
as a ripping yarn.-~T.R. (4/17/95) (Mov-


and C.E.O. of Archer-Daniels-Midland;
Robert Strauss, the former Democrat-
ic National Committee chairman; and
Dan Lufkin, a founder of the Wall
Street firm of Donaldson, Lufkin & 
Jenrette. To run Columbia over all, he
recruited a friend, Alan Hirschfield. To
run the studio, he hired David Begel-
man, Barbra Streisand's agent, whom
Ray Stark had recommended. The stu-
dio made a comeback, and Stark and
Allen became close. Stark introduced 
Allen to the powers of Hollywood, and
he introduced him to the pleasures of
Sun Valley. Allen and Stark were in-
congruous friends: one brassy, the other
private; one a shameless self-promoter,
whose official six-page biography boasts
of his "unique personality," the other so
modest that in 1979, when he was dat-
ing the actress Ann Reinking, he did
not tell her that he had tackled a rob-
ber on Madison Avenue, wrestled the
gun away, and held the man down un-
til the police arrived. Reinking, who
later became Allen's second wife, read
about it in the New York Post. "If
Herbert were a girl, I'd marry him,"
Stark says. "He's the perfect kind of 
companion."
  Life at Columbia was not all glam-
our. In September of 1977, Allen
learned that David Begelman had
forged signatures on three studio checks
worth a total of forty thousand dollars.
Hirschfield wanted to fire Begelman
immediately. Stark wanted to give


Begelman, a friend, a chance to explain.
Allen sided with Stark.
  At first, Columbia executives quietly
turned the matter over to the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the Los
Angeles District Attorney's Office,
but when the publicity continued the
board stripped Begelman of his titles
and his options and removed him from
the board. Allen and Stark were an-
noyed; they continued to consult Begel-
man, and in December Hirschfield tried
to placate them by reinstating him as
the head of the studio, only to ease
him out again in February of 1978. In
David McClintick's best-selling book
"Indecent Exposure" Allen was por-
trayed as a cynic. Friends felt that he
was just being loyal. To this day, Allen
expresses no regret. He refuses to think
of Begelman's act as thievery, saying
that he had had a mental breakdown.
He attributes the furor to a "post-
Watergate morality," and says of the 
matter, "Given the morality of the day,
and the uproar in the press, it was un-
realistic to think he could be reinstated."
There was one other casualty of this
sorry affair: Alan Hirschfield. Before
1978 ended, Allen had replaced him
with Fay Vincent, who was then a law-
yer with the S.E.C.
  In 1981, Donald Keough, the presi-
dent of Coca-Cola and its No. 2, vis-
ited Allen. Domestic sales of Coke had
reached a plateau, Keough told him; the
company was looking for ways to shore
up domestic earnings and would be in-
terested in acquiring Columbia if it was
available. Keough recalls being stunned
when Allen, instead of trying to sell him
on the value of Columbia, warned him
that the entertainment business con-
tained unwelcome surprises, insufferable
egos, and uninvited publicity, and that
entering the field might mean Coca-
Cola's wholesome name would be tar-
nished. "He raised a lot of objections
that he thought we might like to con-
sider," says Keough, who soon became
a close friend of Allen's. "He was like
Aquinas. It was sort of symbolic of
Herbert." Despite Allen's warnings,
Coca-Cola wanted to buy, and in
March of 1982 Allen sold Columbia for
seventy-two dollars a share, or nearly
thirty dollars a share more than its stock
price. Since Allen had paid roughly 
three dollars a share for the stock a de-
cade before, the deal was a dream for


ing a cut-rate franchise to Washington,
where large sectors of the Orioles' fan
base make their home.) The O's, whose
assets include the delectable downtown
Camden Yards-~the very model of a
modern major stadium-~and the game's
prime active hero, Cal Ripken, Jr., drew
ninety-seven per cent of capacity for
their home opener and have already sold
eighty-five per cent of the available tick-
ets for the remainder of their season.
The best P.R., one might almost say,
comes naturally.
  If my own state of mind about the
immediate condition of the pastime is
any indicator, bad feelings about base-
ball now center on the apparent inde-
structibility of the long feud between the
two embittered parties, and the fact that
the strike seems to have settled nothing.
Negotiations between the owners and
the Players Association, which had
seemed to be edging closer to a compro-
mise settlement just before Judge Soto-
mayor's intervention, have screeched to
a stop, and there is persistent talk that
both sides are now girding for another
showdown at World Series time next
year. For the present, both sides are left
with a shattered economy that will con-
tinue to offer very high salaries to a rela-
tively small number of star players-~
about fifteen per cent of the total, that
is-~and much less to the remainder.
Major-market clubs like the Yankees
and Braves and Colorado Rockies will
continue to snatch up the available top
pitchers and fielders and sluggers, as
they have lately done with the likes of
Jack McDowell and Marquis Grissom
and Larry Walker, and have-not teams,
such as the Expos and Mariners and Pi-
rates-~the small-market franchises


DANCING


TWYLA THARP'S imagination is
purely kinetic. It is notably not
literary (the more she toys with
story lines and notional inspirations, the
more she proves herself unsuited to them),
but neither is it visual. I'm not questioning
the visual attractiveness of her work. She
was an art-history major and at one time
the wife of a painter; and she has visual
taste. But not visual imagination. The ab-
sence of a visualizing capacity creates the
odd rift between feeling and form that
makes some of her work, despite the 
devouringly kinetic energy, enigmatic in
the wrong way. One simply does not see
what she sees. A choreographer's visual
imagination is more like a sculptor's than 
like a painter's. Even Tharp's best work
denies or is sublimely innocent of the Re-
naissance perspective that informs the
proscenium stage. Tharp moves across,
around, and in between stage areas, set-
ting up clouds of bee-like activity in the 
interstices of the Renaissance grid or
channelling her dancers through it like
a traffic cop. She comes straight at you 
and flies off-~not on a tangent but on a 
tangent's tangent. It can be breathtaking.
The great fault line in Tharp can promote
ingenious effects on its own, and the
bursting kineticism has often concealed it
completely. But the center cannot always
hold. Sometimes it's only velocity that
stands between Tharp and disaster.
  Tharp has just made three ballets for
American Ballet Theatre. The best is a
jazz panorama, a collaboration with
Wynton Marsalis called "Jump Start."
"Americans We" is about the nineteenth
century in scenes and anecdotes-~the
things Tharp is least good at-~alternat-
ing with the fully revved-up bravura
dances she does well but overdoes here.
"How Near Heaven," the only one of the
three pieces that enters the repertory this
season, is almost totally opaque. I've seen
it three times, twice at the Kennedy Cen-


ter, where it had its world premi~~re, and
again at the Met, where the new works 
were presented together on an all-Tharp
evening, and I am no nearer Heaven than
I was the first time. "How Near Heaven"-~
the title comes from Emily Dickinson-~
has two women dancing nearly identical
roles in what appears to be a metaphysi-
cal drama. The forces in play are repre-
sented by male partners, male groups, fe-
male groups, and mixed couples, all of
whom come and go in different combi-
nations, wearing flowing silk costumes by
Gianni Versace. As you sit through the
piece trying to decipher its meaning, your
attention fastens on little incidents em-
bedded in the flow-~a pot-smoking
party, a funeral.  But they don't add up.
What adds up is the lingerie-~the silk 
costumes changing from white to black
and back again, the men appearing with-
out their tops, and the one couple in sky-
blue silk who keep coming and going
without changing. When the Eternal
Ones make an exit in silence as the lights
fade, you think the piece must be over,
but the lights fade to dark, stars come out
on the backcloth, and it starts all over
again. "How Near Heaven" is Tharp at
her mushiest-~it even has a mushy con-
sistency. The music is Benjamin Britten's
"Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge."
Britten has his own scaffolding, and his
surface is tense and glossy. Tharp trans-
lates none of this to the stage. His taffeta
strings and her macram~~ are from sepa-
rate worlds; never for one moment do
music and choreography get together in
this ballet.
  For choreographers who were brought
up in ballet, as Tharp was not, a formal
capacity for visualization is not really a
gift; it is an asset built into their training.
When literariness or picturesqueness is
getting Tharp into trouble, when she's
aiming at major effects and misfiring,
there's no big picture clearly in motion

and Asian nation, the war was a disaster
without parallel in history. What the butch-
er's bill shows-~and what the end of the
cold war makes it easier to acknowledge-~
is that the war against Nazi Germany was
overwhelmingly fought and won by the So-
viet Union. The British and American cam-
paigns in Western Europe and North Africa
were almost sideshows.
  Body count: Take the most basic index,
the body count. Most of the casualties of
World War II came on the German-Soviet
front. The Soviets lost 10 million soldiers
and at least that many civilians; by some
estimates 15 million civilians died, mostly
from starvation, forced labor and German
reprisals. Only the European Jews and
Gypsies lost a larger percentage of their
population. Germany lost 4 million sol-
diers, most of them on the eastern front;
another 3 million German civilians died,
perhaps two thirds of them in forced expul-
sions from Eastern Europe. By contrast, the
United States lost 408,000 troops in both
Europe and the Pacific, while Britain lost
244,000 men, plus 60,000 civilians. There's
another reason why the American perspec-
tive on the war is unique. The economy of
every other combatant was devastated, but
America's grew by an average of 10 per-
cent a year. By 1945 the United States had
achieved a global economic supremacy un-
matched in history (and now fading).
  What's amazing about World War II is
how little it settled. Yes, Hitler was defeat-


ed, and on VJ Day the following August,
the Japanese empire collapsed. But in the
bloody dawning of the post-cold-war world,
we see that the issues that underlay World
War II confront us still, no easier to answer
now, it turns out, than in what the poet
Auden fashionably reviled as the "low dis-
honest decade" of the 1930s. Roosevelt and
Churchill dreamed of a new world order
mediated by the United Nations (benefi-
cently controlled by the great powers sit-
ting on the Security Council). The cold war
sidetracked that dream. For a brief period
in the early 1990s, during the Bush adminis-
tration, it looked as if the dream would be
revived. But now "new world order" has
become a term of opprobrium for many; the
American mood has swung sourly against
the United Nations-~indeed, against all no-
tions of multilateralism.
  The future and security of Central Europe
are a major piece of unfinished business. The
way World War II ended resolved for nearly
50 years the problems of Central Europe: the
Soviet Union simply absorbed the region.
Now that the states of Central Europe are
free once more, the problems of their securi-
ty are with us again. It is not at all clear that
current U.S. policy-~the so-called "Partner-
ship for Peace"-~is in reality very different
from the deeply ambiguous security guaran-
tees that Britain and France offered those
same states in the 1930s.
  In retrospect, the two world wars and the
cold war are in some fashion a definable


Epic victories: Battle flags in Red Square


BILL CLINTON LOOKED MORE THAN A
little displeased when he emerged
from his three-hour summit with Bo-
ris Yeltsin to answer questions last week.
He was going to have to wing it; overzeal-
ous Kremlin security had bottled up the
senior staff who were carrying his opening
statement. Not that there was much to say.
On substance and even symbolism, Clinton
had been outmuscled. Yeltsin stuck to plans
for selling nuclear reactors to Iran, re-
mained hostile toward NATO's expected
eastward expansion and ignored Clinton's
pleas for a permanent ceasefire in Chech-
nya. As if to underscore the intransigence,
Russian helicopters that day fired rockets
into farmhouses in a Chechen village.
  For all the White House's talk about
a tougher, less Yeltsin-centric approach
to Russia's rogue behavior, Clinton still 
seemed oddly protective of his counterpart.
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole branded 
the gathering "a failure" and called for a
reassessment of U.S. aid. Even nonparti-
san observers were nonplused. "This rein-
forces the impression that this administra-


tion has a pro-Yeltsin policy, not a pro-
democracy policy," says Michael McFaul of
the Carnegie Endowment in Moscow.
  Knowing what was coming, the White
House had labored for weeks to lower ex-
pectations. The U.S.-Russian relationship,
it argued, was too important to be "held
hostage" to a few thorny issues. As he flew
home, a weary Clinton appealed for a new
view of summitry in the post-cold-war era,
in which the stakes-~and the prospects for
breakthroughs-~are diminished. "Once in a
while something spectacular will happen.
Once in a while a wheel will run off and
something bad will happen," he said. "But
we need to view this in the context of a 
steady effort." No wheels fell off in Mos-
cow, but a couple continued to wobble.
  ~ Chechnya: Yeltsin was unyielding about
his brutal suppression of the Chechen re-
bellion, ignoring Clinton's entreaties for a
political solution. He likened the uprising
to Oklahoma City-style terrorism and char-
acterized Russian activity in the region as
mostly "creative work," such as rehabilitat-
ing buildings. Clinton's attitude to such


oughly analyze the contract details and not
find a single rotten thing in it."
  ~ NATO: On the delicate question of Eu-
ropean security, Clinton did manage to 
wrest a concession. Yeltsin agreed to move
Russia into the Partnership for Peace-~a
U.S.- and NATO-inspired organization de-
signed to foster cooperation with countries
of the old Soviet bloc. Yeltsin's willingness to
sign membership documents eases tensions
triggered last December when he predicted
that NATO plans would bring about a "cold
peace." But deep differences over NATO's
expansion to the east remain unresolved.
The two men agreed to discuss the matter
again at the G-7 meeting in Halifax next
month, but they are unlikely to come to
terms. And despite U.S. insistence that Rus-
sian opposition won't slow expansion, some
Eastern European countries are dubious.
  Clinton did his best work last week out-
side the Kremlin, face to face with the Rus-
sian people. In a thoughtful speech at Mos-
cow State University, he urged students to
stay the course with democracy. He ate
breakfast with opposition leaders, who told
him how moved many people were by his
presence at a parade of Russian veterans.

rest of America gets on with its affairs, the
hard part has only just begun for the fam-
ilies of victims. "Let the healing begin," said
evangelist Billy Graham four weeks ago at
the memorial service televised throughout 
the nation. His call was wildly premature.
Throughout the city, the aftershocks of the
homemade bomb that took 168 lives and
wounded more than 400 others are still 
being felt. One family that lost a child con-
tinues to set an extra place at the dinner
table. A rescue worker keeps splashing his
face with cologne yet still can't rid himself
of the stench of rotting bodies. A woman
who lost all her children in the blast asks,
numbly: "Am I still a mother?"
  Grief is a complex process. Unlike be-


in theological perspective. "God did not do
this," he reminded a congregation of 250
friends and family members, lest any of
them were tempted to blame the Creator.
"Evil people did." Others, though, suggest-
ed that the tragedy was somehow God's
will, or sought to comfort families by telling
them that their children were now little
angels in a place beyond all pain.
  But Grollman believes the need to blame
is a normal part of the grieving process,
especially when death comes unexpectedly
and without reason. "No one likes to lose
someone in this life, even those who believe
in an afterlife," he says. From his own study
of clerical reactions to death, Grollman
finds that "many clergy do not believe the
bromides they tell others at funerals. I told
a meeting of clergy in Oklahoma City that
it's OK to be angry at God. He's big enough
to take it."
  Calm Waters: A mass tragedy can reopen
barely buried hurts. People are "regrieving
from previous losses," says John Dudley, a
school counselor from Lincoln, Neb., who,
like hundreds of others, went to Oklahoma
City to help out. One therapist came
to the aid of an elderly woman in Okla-
homa City, at a meeting of Calm Waters,
one of several support groups aiding the
survivors throughout the area. She com-
plained of feeling sick-something that
hadn't happened when her husband died 
last February.
  Grief takes many forms. When a parent
dies, the past dies too. When a spouse dies,
the present disappears. And a child who
dies takes a parent's future with him. Al-
though grief is a universal emotion, coping
with it is a skill that must be acquired. But
studies show that most Americans are well 
into their 40s or 50s before they experience
the death of someone close. Moreover,
"grieving has been greatly affected by
changes in the family like the increase in
divorce, remarriages and the movement of
grown children far from home," says John
Carmon, a funeral director in Windsor,
Conn. Carmon is one of a growing number 
of funeral directors who employ grief thera-
pists to help survivors cope months after
the funeral. "Many people today have no 
faith or family," Carmon finds. "Even
strongly religious people don't necessarily
have the coping skills that the intact family
used to bring to death 30 years ago."
  The worst depression that survivors ex-
perience usually comes six months after the
death of a loved one. But grieving is a life-
long process, experts say, a pain that never
goes away and only gets less bad. A single
bomb blew holes in families across three 
generations. And in Oklahoma City, survi-
vors will be grieving well into the next
millennium.

  Robinson concedes that it is "disquiet-
ing and uncomfortable in a racist environ-
ment" for blacks to denounce black lead-
ers, even vile ones. That's a problem every
hyphenated American minority group
faces: how much dirty laundry to expose
to outsiders who are not always sympa-
thetic. Gwen McKinney, president of a 
black public-relations firm in Washington,
says that ostracizing Nigeria is a "double-
edged sword." While protesters march,
Congress is putting foreign aid to Africa
on the chopping block. Will the protests
encourage the aid cutters? Will the cam-
paign unintentionally reinforce negative
stereotypes of the "Dark Continent"? Ste-
ven Barboza, a New York writer who
follows international affairs, is appalled 
by the situation in Nigeria. Yet he is reluc-
tant to support an economic embargo be-
cause that puts an African nation on the 
same footing as Iran, a supporter of inter-
national terrorism.
  Africa has taken on a romanticized status
for many black Americans who, under-
standably, would prefer to blink at some of
the continent's harsher realities. Clayton
Riley, a former New York talk-radio host,
says U.S. blacks need to see Africa for
"what it really is as opposed to the myths
and the dreams." That's hard to do, while
the neighbors are watching.

So it's not just a matter


of our scoping-out digital cameras; it's also a matter of the
systems makers scoping-out us. Because the best we can
say about standards of judgment in multimedia and video
is: it depends.
  The Sony Jumbotron that makes you blind at five feet
looks as crisp as an RGB Laserdisc across the stadium. Our
assessments must be case-specific again, just like the other
fields where digital cameras are considered. How much of
a luster you need, and how much you'll get, are the issues
in balance for every production. You'll never go larger than
a monitor screen? Buy a digital camera, and enjoy! As long
as you're sure you'll never have to crop too much into any
image. And yes, cropability is one major difference be-
tween 640 x 480 resolution, and something higher.
  The 640 x 480 specification fills a 14-inch computer
monitor, but "floats" in the middle of a 20-inch screen.
Dub the digital image to NTSC videotape and run it on
TV monitors, however, and you can fill almost any size
screen. Do you know the conditions under which your

according to Bob Seitz, president of Visual In-Seitz, an
AV production company in Rochester, New York. "When
one of my staff asked what the real benefits are of a digital
camera," he said, "I made a flow-chart outlining the steps 
and their typical costs for images that start on film, and in
digital formats. The figures for digital were about half."
  The figures are generalizations, and make certain as-
sumptions, such as the perfection of the digital image on
the first take without the need for reshooting. Still, as a
rule-of-thumb for tabletop photography destined for the
presentation screen, Seitz' figures are about as close to a
rule-of-thumb as any estimate can come.

VIDEO FUTURES
One of the golden promises of digital cameras has been
the prospect of an electronic presentation system-~the


systems as such, than because of the limits inherent in cur-
rent display apparatus.
  Most video projectors, after all, are geared for NTSC 
resolution. And although there are so-called data-grade 
and graphics-grade electronic projectors, they're extremely
expensive and therefore not widely installed at this point.
High-definition TV projectors, such as those conforming
to the old 1125/60 analog standard, could make the most
of a high-resolution digital image. But unfortunately, hi-
def means more than just simple pixel resolution. Most
such standards propose a panoramic screen, with an aspect
ratio in the vicinity of 16:9. The CCDs commonly used
in digital cameras are more like 3:2 (film ratio) or 4:3
(NTSC ratio). Going to the wider screen could require
cropping, again.
  Still, the digital camera finds many surprising uses in
multimedia presentations suggesting, once more, that pre-
sentations may prove to be among its most natural mar-
kets. "We make a lot of composites," said Seitz, "in which


adapter. VCRs accessed information 
too slowly and the cost of videodisc
players and mastering videodiscs lim-
ited their use to high-end or high-
volume applications.
  Apple's QuickTime Movies pro-
vided the first glimpse at true com-
puter video. Microsoft followed with
the AVI file format for the PC. Both
of these formats demand serious re-
sources from the host computer's
CPU, create huge unwieldy files, and
yield marginal quality without expen-
sive hardware assistance. MPEG de-
livers on the promise to eliminate
these problems.
  In this review I look at one high-
end, real-time MPEG encoder and
two more-affordable MPEG decoders.
A wave of less-expensive real-time
MPEG encoders is expected soon.
Coupled with the already lower-priced
MPEG decoder boards, this technol-
ogy upgrade will further reduce the
cost of full-screen, full-motion video.
  ENCODING
  With compression ratios as high as


200:1, MPEG produces very usable
30fps video with data rates as low as
150KB per second (9MB per minute).
This rate can be handled by a 1X
speed CD-ROM and translates to 60
minutes of "almost VHS quality" on
a standard CD.
  MPEG 1 NTSC resolution is 352
x 240 pixels, with color depth rang-
ing from 15 to 24 bits. Compressing 
an MPEG stream of audio and video
in real-time requires tremendous pro-
cessing power. MPEG compression

rates, we encoded video at 1.2, 2.5,
3.5, 4, and 5MB per second with
PrimeView. MPEG streams recorded
at 1.2MB per second. (1X CD-ROM
speed) were very respectable, but at
data rates of 2.5MB per second and
greater the output looked noticeably
better. There was little or no differ-
ence in picture quality above 3.5MB
per second. To capture above 3.5MB

ing at the bit to include Web client technolo-
gy in their products. But there's no consensus
on which of the two standards to adopt.
  Mosaic, developed by the National Center
for Supercomputing Applications at the 
University of Illinois, comes with an unusual
licensing agreement. A master licensing
agreement between NCSA and Spyglass
means NCSA doesn't handle requests for
licenses. In 1994, Spyglass developed En-
hanced NCSA Mosaic (a modified version of
the Mosaic found free on the Net) and now
licenses it to software publishers, hardware
manufacturers, and book publishers.
  You can find Enhanced Mosaic technol-
ogy in such products as Spry's Air Mosaic
(Spry has recently been acquired by 
CompuServe), Luckman Interactive's Super
Mosaic, and Quarterdeck's Qmosaic, as well 
as in hardware from Digital Equipment
Corp. and in books from publishers such as
O'Reilly & Associates and Ventana Press.
  A recent major addition to Spyglass's sta-
ble is Microsoft, which has licensed
Enhanced Mosaic for Windows 95. But
Microsoft hasn't yet made clear whether or in
what form Enhanced Mosaic might appear.
  Unlike NCSA, Netscape Communica-
tions Corp. freely licenses the Web browser
it developed. Netscape Navigator has over-
taken the FTP version of NCSA Mosaic as
the most frequently used "free" browser on
the Web, but-~strictly speaking-~it's not a

from scripts written in a simple scripting
language. You can use drawing tools and
add bitmaps to adjust and add to a dia-
gram, but the diagram's structure is con-
trolled by its script.
  Does this approach makes sense? It
does if you'd rather put your energy into
defining structure than into depicting it.
Moreover, the program assists so well
with script generation and offers so many
well-designed alternatives regarding the
final appearance of its diagrams, that
many users will be relieved not to have to
rely on drawing tools.
  You enter scripts in a supplied editor;
you can also import them from your own
editor. You can split the screen to show
both diagram and script, or toggle be-


tween screens. A click in the diagram
window updates the diagram to the cur-
rent state of the script. In the script, you
type the text that will appear in each dia-
gram shape and use punctuation to indi-
cate connections between shapes. A peri-
od denotes a sequential step, for
example, while a question mark intro-
duces a yes/no branch. Acquiring a work-
ing knowledge of the language will take
only about an hour.
  You can diagram first and study later,
thanks to 108 sample scripts for numerous
common diagram archetypes. The ability 
to diagram first is new to this version and
makes the package more accessible than
previous versions. Templates (there are
32) include fill-in-the-blank placeholders 
containing instructions such as "<State-
ment on Yes Branch>". When you put


Style choices are recorded in a separate 
file that can be merged with any script file
to achieve consistency across diagrams.
To facilitate global changes, the program
offers a button that you click to cycle
through canned formatting combinations
appropriate for the current diagram.
Other packages achieve the same effect 
by saving customized templates or offer-
ing similar features. To help you make 
local changes, a right mouse-click brings
up a one-stop property dialog. You can
also drag handles to change a symbol's 
size or shape (but not its position), or click
on a draw palette to add boxes, straight 
lines, or text. For further adornment, all-
Clear supplies 50 clip-art images.
  allClear lets you link diagrams and at-
tach a node to any file. You can store the
linked diagrams in one file, rather than go
through the arduous process of linking files
on your disk. The package also lets you dis-
tribute a runtime version of flowcharts.
  Printing features include scaling to a
single page, intelligent page breaks, the
option to omit blank pages, and page
mapping. If you map, a footer indicates
the numbers of continuing pages on the
top, bottom, left, and right.
  The program has OLE 1.0 server and 5
Lotus Notes/FX support, exports .WMF
files, and can generate diagrams from data
stored in .WK1 and .DBF files. With just a
bit of preprocessing, you can make your 
.DBF file a data source for an organization
chart, so that diagram boxes automatical-
ly pick up personnel data in .DBF fields.
  allClear III's modus operandi may not
be suitable for all users, but it's a remark-
ably effective way to generate a wide
range of stylish diagrams.

Suitablility to Task:
Flowcharting Software
The art of creating a flowchart can be
pretty straightforward. But when
you're trying to develop a coherent
chart, you might find a messy, non-
sensical array of lines and shapes on
your hands if the package you're
using doesn't offer plenty of automa-
tion and customization features.

We rate each product for Power and Ease. Power
refers to the wealth and strength of features, and
Ease addresses implementation. Usability is figured
into each product's Ease rating.
In our Chart Manipulation task, we evaluate
packages' chart types, creation tools, and variety of
templates. We also evaluate the ability to insert a
line automatically between two shapes and respond
intelligently when the user breaks a connecti on.
Also in this task we rate the packages' abilities to


attach fields to shapes and import field data from
spreadsheets and databases.
In our Output task, we rate the packages' printing
and exporting features. The print features we
evaluate include the ability to let users scale a chart
to arbitrary levels and force a chart to fit a page. We
also look for a print-preview or show-page feature.
In evaluating export features, we rate packages
well if they let you export files to .WMF, .BMP, and
other standard formats.
In our Integration/Programmability task, we look
for OLE 2.0 client and server support, hierarchical dia-
grams, and the ability to set up charts so that a user
can click on a shape to launch another application.


Windows 3.0 to Windows 3.1. The Win-
dows 3.0 documentation reverses the
meanings of the two parameters, labeling
the first double-word parameter as re-
served and the second word parameter as
wReturnCode. Also in the 3.0 documen-
tation, the wReturnCode value is de-
scribed as the value Windows returns to
DOS as its return code. While this value
has no meaning if Windows is restarted or
the system is rebooted, it can be valuable
for those times where the Windows ses-
sion is simply terminated.
  The ExitWindowsExec function pro-
vides a convenient way for an application
to end a Windows session, run a DOS ap-
plication, and return to Windows after the
DOS application has closed. This function
takes two parameters: a pointer to a string
containing the DOS application to run
and a pointer to the parameters to pass to
the DOS application.
  Both ExitWindows and ExitWindows-
Exec return a Boolean value indicating
the success or failure of the functions.
While it might seem strange that a func-
tion shutting down Windows could fail, it 
is a common occurrence. The reason is
that all Windows applications are notified
that Windows is shutting down and must
agree to the shutdown. Most users know
that shutdown will fail if a DOS session is
running and the PIF says not to "Allow


Windows is loading. Though less conve-
nient, the LOAD= and RUN= lines do
have one important advantage in that they
are processed before the Startup group.
With the LOAD and RUN keys, you can
ensure that a given program is loaded first.
  Now that we have reviewed how Win-
dows starts and ends, it is time to look
again at SaveIt. SaveIt's functions can be
divided into four parts: knowing when
Windows is shutting down, determining 
the programs running when the shutdown
occurs, knowing what programs the Pro-
gram Manager will start when Windows
restarts, and launching the appropriate 
programs when Windows restarts.
  Detecting that Windows is shutting
down is simply a matter of checking for
the WM_QUERYENDSESSION and
WM_ENDSESSION messages. When
SaveIt receives a WM_QUERYEND-
SESSION, it performs the work to deter-
mine what programs need to be started
next time. The list of these programs is
then saved in SaveIt's .INI file. SaveIt re-
turns TRUE when it processes the
WM_QUERYENDSESSION message
to indicate it is okay for Windows to shut
down. When the WM_ENDSESSION
message is received, a check of the
wParam parameter is made to be sure that
Windows is indeed shutting down. If so, 
SaveIt adds its program name to the
LOAD= line so that it will be started

market until late this year, businesses will
not be ready for it and will have to spend mil-
lions of dollars training employees to use it,
according to a market research report by
International Data Corp.
  Business will spend $105 million in 1995 to
train employees to use Windows 95, says
Boston-based IDC. Training and technical sup-
port costs for Windows 95 will rise to $800 mil-
lion by 1998, IDC believes.
  That's in addition to $2 billion that business-

KEY VICTORY ~ Computer manufacturers
do not have a legal obligation to warn PC users
about the potential danger of overusing comput-
er keyboards, ruled a jury in Hastings, Minn.
  The jury's verdict absolved IBM of liability in
a suit brought by former high school secretary
Nancy Urbanski. Urbanski claimed that faulty
design of the keyboard was to blame for repeti-
tive stress injuries that forced her to quit her job.
  After nine weeks of trial, though, the jury
took only a few hours to return its verdict. The
jury found that IBM's keyboards were not 
faulty and that the company had no obligation
to warn users about the dangers of overuse.
  Ironically, the jury also absolved co-
defendant Apple Computer Corp. of liability a
week after Apple reached an undisclosed
out-of-court settlement. Apple's settlement
followed on the heels of a revelation that its


attorneys had withheld documents from the
plaintiff's law team during pretrial discovery.
  The trial could have far-reaching ramifica-
tions. Steve Phillips, one of the attorneys repre-
senting Urbanski, represents more than 1,000 
other plaintiffs filing suit against computer
manufacturers. Like Urbanski, they claim they
suffered injuries as a result of faulty keyboard
design or because manufacturers failed to 
warn them of the dangers of overuse. An IBM
representative said the Urbanski verdict shows
that both research and the law were on its side.

boards. Compaq was acquitted last year in a

nancing or locate new in-


vestors. While a well-written and
professionally prepared financial plan is essen-
tial in obtaining needed capital for growth,
these planning documents represent a snap-
shot in time and generally are filed away never
to see the light of day again.
  Real strategic planning, however, is one of
the most valuable tools a business can use in
charting its course. Used as an ongoing tool, a
marketing and business plan can help man-
agers focus their energy and resources in areas
that will improve profitability. Planning can
provide a clearer understanding of the market-


place and the strengths and weaknesses of the
competition, as well as help businesses formu-
late clearer strategies and allocate funds to 
areas that will maximize returns.
  Why is this invaluable tool so seldom used?
The reasons are simple. First, it requires the ac-
tive participation and input of top manage-
ment; it is not something that can be handed to
a consultant or a planning department to put
together. Second, it requires constant moni-
toring and refinement. Third, it requires busi-
ness owners and managers at all levels to
change the way they do business. Planning re-
quires thought before action, proactive (not re-
active) management, and allocation of funds 
based on return on investment.
  Whether you are looking for that snapshot
in time or you are willing to change the way
you run your business, there are several soft-


ware options that can help you get the job
done. Here's a look at some software pro-
grams, ranging from the best-selling planning
tools to put together a professional sales docu-
ment to serious software for improving your
business and bottom line.
BIZPLANBUILDER ~ BizPlanBuilder is the
No. 1 seller largely due to its simplicity. The pro-
gram uses templates to prepare the plan, which
differ based on the type of computer (Macintosh
or DOS) and software used. The overall layout 
of the plan is fairly comprehensive and, with the
template approach, easy to modify.
  The integrated financial template is well or-
ganized, easy to use, and provides for suffi-
cient detail to handle most businesses. The
financials are generated by entering assump-
tions, basic history information, and pricing
and cost data. In addition to basic statements,
the financials include break-even analysis,
ratio analysis, gross profit analysis, and a per-
sonal financial statement.
  Since it's an integrated template, however, 
the file cannot be modified (lines or columns
added or deleted) without undermining the in-
tegrity of the financials.
  BizPlanBuilder is suited for the first-time
planner. While it uses templates, is composed
of separate narrative and financial sections,
and presents a predefined format that's not 
suited for all businesses, the financials are basi-
cally sound and easy to use. The manual and 
sample plans offer good insight as to what is
needed for a professional plan. It's most suit-
able for developing plans to present to banks

tors to fit your specific needs. You are pro-
vided with various display options, entry
notations, and unit conversions. PentaCalc Pro
also can graph any one-variable function.
  The two components of PentaCalc Pro are
the display interface, similar to the display
on a handheld calculator, and calculator
interface, which looks like a calculator
keyboard. The display interface consists of a
title bar, menu bar, tape display, and entry
display. Interfaces can be attached to one
another, resized, and scaled.
  The tape display not only shows a record of
your calculations, but can include memo nota-
tions next to any entry so you can remember 
what a calculation was for. The tape is "live,"
which allows you to make recalculations from 
any point in the tape by editing both numbers
and operators using standard Windows
methods of inserting, deleting, etc. Tapes can
be printed and saved as files. You can quickly 
transfer the results of your calculations be-
tween PentaCalc Pro and other Windows ap-
plications by using the clipboard.
FINANCIAL CALCULATIONS ~
PentaCalc Pro includes several tools for
financial calculations such as amortization
tables, compound interest, cash flow,
bond yields, depreciation, percentages, and
interest rate conversions.


  For instance, assume your business has a
large amount of money to invest and you
must weigh the investment options. You are
faced not only with varying interest rates, but
with different compounding periods. Bank ac-
counts generally pay interest monthly or
daily; stocks pay dividends quarterly; most
bonds pay interest semi-annually; and some
options only pay annually. To make a compar-
ison, you must convert the nominal interest
rates to effective interest rates.
  For these calculations you would use
PentaCalc Pro's Business calculator, which
contains interest rate conversion buttons. 
These buttons figure nominal and effective
interest rates, using either periodic or contin-
uous compounding. To calculate a conver-
sion, click on the appropriate calculator key
for the compounding period: Per for peri-
odic or Con for continuous.
  For periodic compounding only, type in the
number of periods per year and click on the 
P/Yr key. Then type in the nominal interest
rate and click on the Nom% key (or the effec-
tive rate and click on Eff%). Finally, click on 
the Eff% key to calculate the effective interest
rate (or Nom% to calculate the nominal).
  Suppose you are considering three different
investment options: one pays 7.4% annual in-
terest, compounded quarterly; another pays 
7.38%, compounded monthly; and the third pays


7.32%, compounded continuously. Where
should your business put its money?
  From the PentaCalc Pro menu, select
Calc, Financial, and Business to switch
to the Business calculator. Then click on
Options and make sure the following
are selected: Degrees, Fixed 2, Decimal,
and Algebraic.
  Enter the first calculation by clicking
on the Per key, typing 4, clicking on the
P/Yr key, typing 7.4, clicking on the
Nom% key, and then clicking on the 
Eff% key to display an effective interest
rate of 7.61%.
  For the second calculation, type 12,
click on the P/Yr key, type 7.38, click on


the Nom% key, and then click on the 


Eff% key to display 7.63%.
  For the third calculation, click on the Con
key, type 7.32, click on the Nom% key, and
then click on the Eff% key to display 7.59%.
  The second option pays a higher effective
interest rate, and would be your investment
choice.
ADD IT UP ~ Besides its many calculation
options, PentaCalc Pro contains conveniences

  Security-~probably no other subject in a 
data-intensive environment causes as much
discussion or has the most destructive po-
tential if not handled properly. From a busi-
ness with a standalone computer to the
company with hundreds of networked PCs,
the issue of security must be addressed.
Although companies may spend a great deal
of effort choosing the right hardware and
software, system security often is forgotten
in planning.
  A good system allows easy data access for
those with system rights, but makes it difficult
for those who don't belong. System access
boils down to identification and authentication
with user IDs and passwords. Security should
protect against unauthorized access as well as
accidental damage.
CONSIDER YOUR SYSTEM ~ As a
quick security test on your present com-
puter system, write down what you think
constitutes an acceptable, secure system. If
your system doesn't satisfy all of the cri-
teria, then it's time to think about im-
proving security. Clarifying your business'
security expectations along with a system 
training program for employees helps en-
sure and maintain integrity.
  Software manufacturers have been keenly
aware of the security issue for some time.
Several protection methods are used to

Germs In The Oil Patch


JACKSON, MI-~Energy researchers hope in-
visible allies-~bacteria-~can help them recov-
er oil from underground fields.
  Producers have long injected water into oil 
reservoirs to push black gold toward wells.
Once the water has swept through the most
permeable layers of sand, however, it contin-
ues to flow through only those layers, leaving
oil trapped in less penetrable regions.
  Hughes Eastern Corp. is enlisting germs to
change all that. By dosing water with plant fer-
tilizer, engineers hope to stimulate the growth 
of bacteria that will plug the spaces between
sand grains in the water-swept layers. Water
can then be forced through unswept layers.
  Workers have already added nutrients to
water pumped into four oilwells near Vernon,
Alabama. In about six to eight months, Hughes

Warship Wheels
PANAMA CITY, FL-~What more chal-

than the deck of a Navy ship? Space is tight,
passages are steel-edged and the work-~
toting live missiles-~is hazardous.
  But the Omni-Directional Ordnance
Handler, recently tested at the Naval Sur-
face Warfare Center, appears to pass
muster. Developed by a Swedish inventor
in the 1970s, the vehicle moves on four
unconventional 18-in. wheels. Elliptical
rollers, offset by 45~, encircle each wheel
hub. A computer controls the rotation 


orientation while moving.

since one of its 32-character messages
is airborne for less than a second,
callers in the vicinity won't hear much
more than a blip. If repeated bursts 
prove annoying, one solution is for the

Zender's nine-volt battery.) Infrared

everything is basically in place-~torch
fragments, stone tools, fire pits, and
bones. We have well-preserved evi-
dence of all the activities that were go-
ing on in and around these paintings.
And that's critical."
  The most conspicuous artifacts are
large bones, which have been cemented
to the floor by dripping, limestone-rich
water. Specialists have identified them 
as the remains of about 40 cave bears,
a ten-foot-tall extinct relative of the 
grizzly bear. Also spotted by Chauvet
and confirmed by specialists are the
perfectly preserved footprints of bears
intermingled with the footprints of hu-
mans. "There's been considerable spec-
ulation about cave bears and the possi-
bility that they were the focus of some
sort of religious activity," says White.
"We now have real evidence that we
can use to evaluate that notion."
  Several explanations for Grotto
Chauvet's bear remains have been pro-
posed. In one scenario, the bears wan-
dered into the cave to hibernate and
died in their sleep; the hunters found
the cave full of bones and decorated it
with paintings. This theory is support-
ed by the discovery of bear claw marks
on the wall under some of the painted
animals. Other possibilities are that
bear bones were scavenged and
brought to the cave or that wild bears
were killed on the site. But it is also
conceivable that there is no connection
between the remains and the artwork.
"There's no guarantee that the pres-
ence of the bear bones had anything to
do with humans," warns White.
  What he finds most intriguing is the
large limestone block in the center of 
the deepest gallery with a bear skull on 
top of it. "When humans come into


these places and start picking up skulls
and posing them in specific places, it
starts getting interesting," he says.
  Denis Vialou, a professor of prehis-
toric art at the National Museum of
Natural History in Paris and one of the
few experts so far allowed in the cave,
points out that bones have been found
at other sites, including the famous
Lascaux cave about 150 miles west of 
Grotto Chauvet, as well as a cave
Vialou excavated 20 years ago called
Fontanet. "When Lascaux was discov-
ered they found reindeer bones on the
floor," he says, "but on the cave walls,
there is just one reindeer. There was no
relationship between the art and the

BRAIN


bottleneck in the brain


the chronically uncoordinated have
long endured taunts about their al-
leged inability to walk and chew gum
simultaneously. But put the jokes on
hold: Psychologists say that doing two
things at the same time can be much harder than we think.
  That's true even when the tasks are simple, says
University of California at San Diego psychologist Harold
Pashler, Ph.D. A three-year-old might be able to perform ei-
ther task alone. But because of a bottleneck in our brain,
even a Nobel Prize winner can't do them simultaneously.
  The major hurdle, apparently, lies in the brain's decision-
making and memory-retrieval systems. When simultaneous
tasks both require us to make a choice or summon a mem-
ory, a mental traffic jam occurs. The second decision must
await completion of the first (although we can act on the
first decision while making the second).
  Pasher's work with split-brain patients, described in
Neuroreport (Vol. 5, No. 17), suggests the bottleneck oc-
curs in the brain's more primitive regions. In these patients

The most effective ways of

about other people often involve stereotypes, which
society frowns upon. Forbidden thoughts have an
intuitive quality to them: It's the things we're not
supposed to think about that often seem most alluring.
  They're clearly linked to our decision-making
mechanisms, our ability to distinguish "right" from 
"wrong," and our capacity to avoid dangerous,
unfavorable outcomes. They may also be associated
with our creative processes.
  However, they can spin wildly out of control. In
extreme cases, forbidden thoughts may become so
powerful that they break out as actual behavior. More
often, though, they get "stuck," become virtually
impossible to dispel, and wreak havoc on our mental
and physical health.
  Much research has focused on the process of thought
suppression-~that is, on the ways we try to banish
unwanted thoughts-~and on the consequences of
suppression. But researchers have also investigated how
and why certain thoughts become forbidden in the first
place. What emerges is an intriguing and complex
picture of the mind, encompassing everything from
genes and neurotransmitters to self-esteem and "family
values." Ultimately, the dilemma of forbidden thinking
rests on the courage to believe in ourselves.

wired for worry
Studies suggest that our individual
vulnerability to forbidden thoughts is
partly inherited, and that some of us are
simply "wired" to dwell on worrisome
thoughts. Yet studies also show that
nearly all of us can be made vulnerable
through a variety of external influences-~influences
that, in many cases, are intensifying. In fact, some
psychologists speculate that our culture's increasingly
fluid and permissive value systems may paradoxically be
rendering us more vulnerable to forbidden thoughts-~
and less able to cope with them.
  "At one time, we had much narrower standards of
what thoughts were right and wrong-~and nearly
everything was wrong," says the University of
Washington's Schwartz. "Today, it's far less clear where
those lines are." And without those societal boundaries,
many psychologists say, people may be over-
compensating with unrealistic, self-imposed
boundaries-~and unwittingly making whole categories
of thought "forbidden."
  This is especially prevalent in the sexual arena. Ours 
is a culture that promotes sexual fulfillment and
liberation while simultaneously insisting on restraint
and "responsibility." Absent any clear standards for
"healthy" thinking, some individuals attempt to ban
their own sexual thoughts with such vigor that they
close off an entire sector of experience.
  The notion that we somehow create forbidden
thoughts may sound strange. Yet many investigators 
argue that what we commonly refer to as "thought"
doesn't begin as either "good" or "bad," but simply as a

early age, and while still quite young can be
taken outside to pee on the lawn. Dogs are
already learning entertaining tricks while
human children can't do much more than
pull things over on top of themselves. Dogs
are a lot cheaper at every stage of develop-
ment and you don't have to worry about
them growing up, leaving you, and telling a
therapist what a miserable parent you were.
  7. You can't expect your children to
serve as cheap labor for you. Some poten-
tial parents are seeking a practical use for 
children. Families used to breed children
for labor, to work in the mines or the mills,
and the children were rewarded with a lit-
tle pay and a lot of honor. Growing up in
the country, I had farm work to do and an-
imals to feed and tend, and I loved it be-
cause it made me feel useful. In some parts
of the world, families have seeing-eye chil-
dren for the blind adults. Children are nat-
ural, eager apprentices, excited to learn
whatever the parents know how to do, de-
lighted to follow the parents around learn-
ing their skills. There should be no thought
of having someone around the house who
doesn't share in work needing to be done.
Children, if they are to become adults,
should be functional and proud of it.
  Somehow it doesn't work out that way
nowadays. For one, child labor is now ille-
gal, as every child knows. And anyone who
has tried to teach a child to do his or her
chores can immediately see the folly in that
effort. It takes far more effort to get a child
to clean his room or take out the garbage
than it does to do it yourself. I see rich kids
who will cut a deal with their parents and
earn what in other families might be a
week's wages for washing the car. It is as if


Having a baby with a guy who is afraid of
commitment and family life, afraid of hus-
bandhood and fatherhood, will not reli-
ably bring him closer to you. And if he 
doesn't like you very much to start with,
he's not likely to like you better when you 
wake him up in the middle of the night to
throw a hungry, wet, feces-smeared,
squishy noisemaker at him.
  The most inescapable fact of human bi-
ology is that females can create life from
their bodies and males cannot. Patriarchy
was invented to give men some feeling of
involvement in the creation of life. But be-
neath the patriarchal posturings of male
ownership that cover the sterile shame of
male uterus-envy, there is full awareness on
the part of men that they can never experi-
ence anything comparable to the 
mother-child relationship. As a result, men

  5. Thou shalt not make a child feel guilty for
not loving you enough. Make a child feel guilty only
for hurting other people.
  6. Thou shalt not teach a child to fear. Instead
you will let the child teach you to stop fearing the
things you fear now.
  7. Thou shalt not teach a child any of the tra-
ditional nonsense about gender, about what he or 
she is permitted to feel, what he or she is per-
mitted to do.
  8. Thou shalt not let your gender determine
your functioning as a parent. Specifically, do not let
yourself get trapped into doing a great deal more


or less of the parenting than your partner. Such a
triangle will eventually destroy all three relation-
ships. Children need fathers as much as they

  Psychiatrist Peter Kramer, M.D., au-
thor of Listening to Prozac, a book that
brought him his own measure of fame,
found himself facing a huge media
maw. "There is so much specialized me-
dia that the amount of material they re-
quire is extraordinary. I was amazed at
the number of outlets on my book tour.
Any small city has cable stations, drive-
time morning shows, women's shows-~
you name it. The sheer amount of ma-
terial needed to run the media we
consume is enormous, so you have to
create lots of characters."
  In the beginning was the image.
Thirty years ago in his landmark book,
The Image, historian Daniel Boorstin
defined modern fame in terms that have
resonated ever since. "The hero was dis-
tinguished by his achievement, the
celebrity by his image. The celebrity is a
person well known for his well-known-
ness. We risk being the first people in
history to have been able to make their
illusions so vivid, so persuasive, so real-
istic that we can live in them."
  The images, in turn, transmute
celebrities into commodities to be sold
for a price. In Claims to Fame: Celebrity


in Contemporary America (University of
California Press), Yale's Joshua Gamson
quotes 1930s screen star Myrna Loy. "I
daren't take any chances with Myrna 
Loy, for she isn't my property....I
couldn't even go to the corner drugstore
without looking 'right,' you see. Not be-
cause of personal vanity, but because the
studio has spent millions of dollars on
the personality known as Myrna Loy."
  As our culture generates its endless
images, we are fed more and more in-
formation about people who are less
and less real. There is increasingly tight
control of the image by the image mak-
ers-~the publicists, managers, and
agents behind the scenes. Press agents
and publicists arrange the locations of 
interviews, channel the discussion into
approved areas, and influence a maga-
zine's selection of a writer by refusing to
cooperate with any scribe they feel will
not benefit the celebrity. A media outlet
that publicizes scathing information
about a star risks alienating a publicist
who controls an entire stable of stars.
  The same control is exercised over 
photos, as well as copy. Celebrities con-

a step forward. The automaker has reread its
own history and simultaneously tossed aside
several precedents. The 456 GT exceeds the
luxurious creature comforts and elegance of
Ferrari's previous four-seater, the 412. In fact,
the car's elegant accoutrements have been
teamed with the styling panache and perfor-
mance reminiscent of, but surpassing, the dev-
astating 365 GTB/4 Daytona coupe.
  The 456 GT 2+2 boasts a clean-sheet-of-paper,
442-bhp V-12; a 6-speed transmission; electroni-
cally actuated, fully independent suspension; 
four enormous ventilated disc brakes with ATE-
supplied ABS; and a ZF limited-slip differential.
  The car's instantly admirable shape is formed
by featherweight aluminum panels welded
(thanks to a unique new process) to a tubular
steel chassis. Lightweight composite materials
form the hood and the headlight pods.


  The 456's wonderfully sleek lines are a delight
from any angle. Pininfarina did more than revive
styling cues from the best of this model's prede-
cessors. Careful airflow management over and
under the car is due to the 456 GT's computer-
engineered underbody, cleverly drawn front spoiler,
and unique F1-technology-derived moving rear
spoiler, which is integrated into the rear bumper.
These elements help minimize lift at velocities we
can only imagine on U.S. highways.
  Inside, there is surprising room for four
adults, highlighted by sumptuous Connolly
leather, brushed aluminum panels, a tall
chromed shifter, and big instrument dials
reminiscent of those in the old 250 GTO.
Sybarites will admire the car's butter-soft match-
ing fitted luggage. Safety advocates will be
made confident by Ferrari's first dual air bag
installation. For clients who prefer not to shift,


a Valeo automatic gearbox is planned, along
with still more luxurious touches.
  Most surprisingly, when it was introduced in 
Europe, the 456 GT handily outperformed Fer-
rari's flagship, the mid-engined 512 Testarossa.
Although this has changed with the introduc-
tion of the Ferrari 512 M, the point was not lost
on marque aficionados. Now you can have all
the blistering performance for which Ferrari is
famous in a dramatic package that encourages 
fast motoring, with a bonus-~there's room for 
four lucky people.
  Ken W. Purdy, who loved Ferraris, would no
doubt be astonished by the performance of this
car-~but he wouldn't be very surprised. Ferrari has
done it again. If you have any doubts which car-
maker consistently builds the world's best exotics,
they will be dispelled in five minutes behind the
wheel of the incomparable Ferrari 456 GT.

oil and grease. Cyclists can then use
the saddle as a carrying handle or roll
the bike along on its suitcase-style
castors.
  The bike is parked by swinging the
rear wheel underneath the main
frame, which reduces the bike's
length by half and allows it to stand
on its own. (This is also the first step
in the folding procedure.)
  Other useful features include
detachable front and rear carriers that
have compartments for documents,
tools, clothes, etc. The front bag can
hold a briefcase or laptop computer
with virtually no effect on handling,
since the bag is attached to the frame,
not the steering assembly.
  The Brompton is available in both a
basic and fully equipped model. The
latter version has a lighting system,
back rack, and five-speed gearing,
none of which affect foldability.
  Already one of the most popular
folding bikes in Europe, the British-
made Brompton is now available to 
U.S. consumers for the first time,
exclusively through Linear Manufac-
turing of Iowa. The company offers a 
10-year warranty on every Brompton
frame it sells. Suggested retail prices
range from $740 to $1,000.

Re-inventing the Wheel
  A high-tech spin has been put on
the bicycle wheel-~and it may be one
that increases your speed.
  The rev-X wheel, as it is called, is
designed to be both lighter and 
stronger than a typical bike wheel. Its
aerodynamic, ultrathin spokes are
made of carbon fibers and Kevlar, the
same material used in the construc-
tion of military aircraft.

  Correction: In the March 1995
Recreation section, the "Shooting Costa
Rica" article contained factual errors.
The name of the bed-and-breakfast 
should have been Aviarios de Caribe,
and Skin Diver Magazine was incor-
rectly referred to as Skin Diving. Also,
Jay Ireland's contribution to the book
Such is Life in Costa Rica: Underwater
was omitted.


  This unique composition gives
the eight spokes of a rev-X wheel
twice the tensile strength of conven-
tional 32-spoke wheels. The material
is also lighter than metal; each
wheel only weighs about 26 ounces.
This can decrease a bicycle's weight
by up to half a pound, a considera-
tion for serious bikers. The wheel 
was developed by Spinergy, a sports
technology company based in 
Wilton, Conn.
  After only one year on the road, the
rev-X is already being used by many 
competitive cyclists, including the Saturn


Cycling Team and the Team New
Balance/Cannondale. Rev-X has also
received a silver 1994 Industrial Design
Excellence Award (IDEA) from the
Industrial Designers Society of America
and Business Week. It was recently
named Product of the Tour by Spokes
magazine during the 1994 Tour DuPont.
  Wheels come in 26- and 27-inch
diameters for touring bikes and a 26-
inch diameter for mountain bikes.
Retail price is about $500 per wheel.

that even many gun owners distinguish between what 
they believe is their sacred right to own weapons for
hunting or for the protection of their homes and the
NRA's insistence that that "right" allows them to stock
up on the kind of weapons that Colin Ferguson used to
spray deadly gunfire in a Long Island, N.Y., railroad car.
Even in pro-gun Montana, the influential Missoulian
newspaper editorialized, following Baucus' risky vote,
that "restricting access to these weapons no more in-
fringes on anybody's rights than laws restricting owner-
ship of live hand grenades."
  But just as it makes no sense to view the NRA as
King Kong, neither is it Bambi. The organization's 
obsessiveness, combined with its take-no-prisoners polit-
ical philosophy, is truly bad news for suddenly vulnera-
ble senators who are clearly in the majority on banning
assault weapons but who hardly need to keep remind-
ing the furious minority of voters of this fact.
  No public-opinion poll can measure the emotional
intensity of the millions of Americans who fear for the
fate of their gun collections. The NRA, which counts
3.5 million dues-paying members, is peopled with the
most dedicated single-issue voters in America. In 1994,
according to Gallup and Harris polls, more than 15 per-
cent of all voters -~ 23 million to 27 million -~ identified
themselves as NRA members.
  Gary Marbut Jr., who looks like a skinnier Dennis
Weaver and meets me at a family restaurant, did not
want to wait for the NRA to launch its national cam-
paign to defeat Baucus in 1996. So Marbut started one 
of his own. He tried to get a statewide resolution passed
calling on Baucus to resign last year, but this was disal-
lowed by Montana's attorney general, who Marbut says
is a close friend of the senator's. (Marbut's plan called for
a vote during Montana's annual Right to Keep and Bear
Arms Week in early March.) So Marbut threw his
statewide organization, the Montana Sports Shooting
Association, into the effort. Currently, its sole raison
d'~~tre would appear to be the political destruction of
Max Baucus. Raising money through advertisements in
gun magazines, Marbut and company have, according to
his own count, broadcast more than 4,000 anti-Baucus

A ratings from the NRA, seven more than the necessary
218 votes needed to win. Lest anyone worry that these
votes may not be firm, it should be noted that the NRA
is one organization whose marking system is not prone to
grade inflation.
  Even before the Oklahoma City bombing, both the
timing and the arithmetic of the Senate vote looked
trickier.  The procedural vote that ultimately allowed the
ban to pass last time around hung by a slender thread.
If Baucus or anyone else had voted no on that initial
vote, the ban would have failed. (Vice President Al
Gore, who can be depended upon to cast the tiebreaking
vote in the Senate when necessary, was busy debating
Ross Perot over NAFTA on the Larry King show when 
the vote took place.) No one claims to have an accurate

A STRIDE GUIDE FOR RUNNERS
Five ways to increase your stride length and run faster


  While I was tempted to lengthen my
own stride, I knew this would probably
backfire. Research has shown that most
runners naturally settle into their most effi-
cient stride. Forcing yourself to increase
this stride length often makes running hard-
er and less efficient because long strides
can create a "braking" effect. This doesn't
happen to the Kenyans, however, because
their long strides develop naturally from 
their workouts.
  When I discussed the stride-length
question with Godfrey, I discovered that this
ability to cover ground so effortlessly results
from simple drills. The Kenyans do lots of
hill running and other exercises that lead to
more explosive footstrikes, longer strides
and, ultimately, faster running speeds.
  You don't have to be Kenyan to devel-
op some of the same techniques yourself.
The following workouts will help:
  1. Boot camp hills. Find a steep hill 
that's at least 50 to 75 meters long, and


Years ago, women sat in kitchens 
drinking coffee and discussing life.
Today, they cover the same topics
while they run. Why? For many reasons.
The psychological and physical benefits vary.
Some enjoy the increased confidence, ener-
gy, muscle and bone strength, endurance
and cardiovascular health that running
bestows. Others run because of what run-
ning helps them lower-~their weight, blood
pressure, resting heart rate, anxiety and
depression. Some run for more than one
reason; some started running for one reason
and continue for another, as their goals and
needs change.
  Speaking for myself, I run for the love
of it and for all it does for me, from the abil-
ity to compete against others and against
myself to the calming day-in, day-out training
routine that is part of both my physical and
mental health.
  When I became a serious runner years
ago, I promised myself that if and when I
no longer found running enjoyable and 
rewarding, I'd stop. Years later, I'm still at
it; I still love it, and I continue to look for-
ward to achieving my running goals. This
love of running is a feeling every woman
can experience.

THE RUNNING LIFE
I run as early in the morning as I possibly
can, before the day comes into full swing.
My running gives me a chance to "air out"
problems or plans. I review my schedule
and prioritize the day. Sometimes I visual-
ize an upcoming race-~particularly if it's a
big one.
  An early run allows me to feel good
about myself for the rest of the day and to
get my "fix." Coffee doesn't do it for me; it's
running that gets me going. If I haven't had
my run, I'm irritable. I feel sluggish and
inept in dealing with daily activities. After I 
run, I feel I can deal with just about anything
that comes my way-~whether it's a business


call, getting my daughter out the door to 
school, keeping my son amused or all of
them simultaneously.
  Life is truly a balancing act. In one
hand, you hold your running, and in the oth-
er, you hold your job, family and other tasks
and challenges that you face on a daily basis.
For all the things that are important in your
life, you have to find that balance.
  With all I do in my life, I'm still trying 
to keep my balance. It's an endless challenge
in my life, as well as in the lives of so many 
women I know. In fact, when the Melpo-
mene Institute for Women's Health Research
in St. Paul asked women what, if anything, 
kept them from running as much as they'd
like to, the number-one obstacle named was
lack of time because of workplace demands,
followed by lack of time because of family
responsibilities.
  Only you can decide how to create a
harmonious balance. Ultimately, only you
know your body, your psyche and the
demands in your life. It may take a while to 
find that balance, but you'll know when it's
achieved. And when you do, it's like a good
race, like the runner's high.

WHAT WORKS FOR YOU
One of the early lessons I learned as an ath-
lete is the need for flexibility. Athletics, like
everything else, is a trial-and-error process.
You stay with what works, you discard what
doesn't. That's why flexibility is an important
ingredient in any training program.
  This has always been true in my career,
but perhaps nothing has tested that truth
like my two children: my seven-year-old
daughter, Abigail, and five-year-old son,
Anders. Since they were born, I've had to
change my training radically (and subse-
quently, often my goals). In doing so, I have
learned that some things work and some
don't. When Abby was born, for example, I
thought I could continue to train twice a day.
But I was just digging myself into a hole.


After a few weeks of frequent feedings and
sleep deprivation, I had to give up that sec-
ond run. It is a change that has remained
permanent. Now I work to make my one run
a day a quality run.
  If you're not flexible when you start out,
it's a trait you acquire by necessity. Before
children-~B.C., I call it-~I would have said I
could never be satisfied unless I ran twice a 
day at least five days a week. Cutting back,
however, left me energized, not fatigued;
renewed, not burned out. That's the beauty
of this sport-~it's adaptable.
  No doubt about it, combining an athlet-
ic career with motherhood definitely has its
ups and downs. To do well at both, I have
established my own personal set of priorities.
For any woman runner, priorities determine
how you spend your time, attention and
energy. I do tend to become more focused,
and a bit more selfish, when I'm training for
a major race, for example. For the most part,
other than my training time-~and barring
meetings or travel-~I spend my time with
my children.
  Also essential to fitting running into
your lifestyle is developing a sense of
wholeness. Unless you feel happy about 
yourself, as integrated as possible, you can't
expect to have success in anything-~from
running to mothering to any other job. I
cannot stress enough how great an effect
this has had on both my personal and pro-
fessional life.
  There's not a better feeling than when
you have found that moment of balance and
harmony when both running and life come
together. Then you truly know why you run
and that you couldn't live without it. ~

Two silver medals are proudly
displayed in Virginia Poyner's fam-
ily room in Franklin, Indiana. Poy-
ner, 51, won them at the World
Duathlon Championships in '92 and
'94. "Our age group is very, very com-
petitive," says Poyner, the number-one-
ranked U.S. female duathlete in the
50-54 age category.
  Fitness is a full-time job for the
grandmother of two. Besides teaching
aerobics and weight training at a health
club, she serves as fitness director at a
drug and alcohol rehabilitation center
for women. "Working out is a big part
of the women's recovery," says Poyner.
"Their self-confidence really blossoms."
  Poyner says her own turning 
point in athletics dates back to just
before her 40th birthday and her
retirement from teaching. That's when
she fulfilled her goal of running a 
marathon. "After that race," she says,
"I wanted to tackle an even bigger 
challenge."
  Ten years and 250 awards later,
Poyner has found her niche in du-
athlons. In the last four years, she's
qualified for Team USA and placed in
the top four in her age group at the
world championships. Says Poyner,
"This is such a treat in later life."

ture sensors further revealed convec-
tive plumes operating within the mixed
layers. The ocean's workings seemed to
be following the patterns we had ob-
served in the laboratory.
  Still, the overall vigor of salt fingering
my colleagues and I encountered dur-
ing C-SALT was somewhat lower than
we had anticipated. Also surprising to
us was that Williams's optical device 
showed the fingers to be tilted far from
vertical by the changes in velocity
(shear) between layers. The weaker mix-
ing seems to have resulted because the
interfaces proved to be a few meters
thick rather than a few tens of centime-
ters, as we had expected from labora-
tory experiments. More sophisticated 
physical models recently developed by
Eric Kunze of the University of Wash-
ington account for the thickness vari-
ations and the effects of the vertical
shear on the ocean's salt fingers.
  Measurements made during C-SALT
also highlighted an important thermo-
dynamic difference between salt fingers
and ordinary ocean turbulence. When 
turbulence from waves and eddies mix-
es the upper ocean, it distorts the nor-
mal temperature distribution as it con-
verts some of the kinetic energy of the
surface movements into potential ener-
gy in the thermal structure (by lifting 
dense parcels of water and depressing 
light ones). Some of this kinetic energy

firm that fingers can evolve in such vis-
cous fluids. Fingers also occur in metal
alloys, leading to speckling and strength 
defects in castings that are cooled from

  Salt-finger mixing can in theory also
arise within stars and in the atmo-
spheres of gaseous planets. Will space

traterrestrial analogues to the C-SALT
staircases when they explore the atmo-
spheres of Jupiter and Saturn? The an-
swer must await advances in planetary

ones. Creation of so-called pixel detec-
tors with this capability is a very active
area. One variety, under development
at CERN and elsewhere, is the hybrid
pixel detector. The detector chip in such
instruments is fabricated in much the
same way as a strip detector, but the
strips are replaced with a two-dimen-
sional array of small squares or rectan-
gles (the pixels), typically 50 to 500 mi-
crons on a side. This chip is sandwiched
to another one carrying a correspond-
ing array of amplifier/signal processing 
elements such that each pixel is con-
nected to one of its elements via a set
of conducting bumps.
  Pixel detectors are planned for the in-
nermost layers of the charged-particle
tracking systems of the big LHC experi-
ments. Close to the collision region, 
with its extreme density of particles,
track recognition and reconstruction
will be best accomplished with the fine-
granularity, space-point measurements
possible with pixel devices.
  Another possible use of pixel detec-
tors, still at an early stage of develop-
ment, is in x-ray radiography for medi-
cal imaging, especially mammography.

with a jazz soundtrack and a collage of
paintings, faces, dates and names that
gradually covers the screen. Once in,
you can take an audio tour of how to
use the disk, watch a brief movie about 
Roy Neuberger (you learn that his focus
was on "buying the work of living art-
ists"-~particularly in Paris in the 1920s
because "good times cause things to
happen in the arts") or enter the data-
base and explore the collection. For us-
ers dazed by the amount of material
available, the most reassuring philo-
sophical statement in the audio tour
comes at the end when the narrator
says, "And don't forget to turn your
computer off at least once a week."
  The disk's graphic interface is attrac-
tive but somewhat confusing. Rows of
similar-looking thumbnail buttons rep-
resent many different things: the art-
works, photographs of the artists, anec-
dotal movies, text about the works, art-
ists and social events of the period. The
user can uncover more buttons (and 
hence more choices) by clicking on ar-
rows at the end of the rows. Once you
have chosen a painting, for instance,
you can request to see links, which calls
up a vertical column of new buttons
next to the work. This setup of hyper-
links creates a great many ways to cir-
culate through the collection, but the
material on the CD-ROM is finite, so
you will soon run into the same materi-
al from a number of different routes.
  The generous use of sound and video
motion in American Visions quickly
pulls the viewer inside the collection.

Made in the light of hydrogen alpha
(H~) and doubly ionized oxygen, the im-
ages reveal multiple rings of circumstel-

of mass loss. 
  In April's Astronomical Journal Mar-
ston discusses the several phases of
Wolf-Rayet evolution implied by these
rings. First, the fast stellar wind of the
main-sequence precursor, a massive O
star, clears away the interstellar material
around it. This results in a shell of
swept-up gas and dust. When the O star
exhausts its core hydrogen fuel and
swells into a giant, it goes through a
mass-ejection phase, partially filling the
cleared-out bubble. During this phase 
the star may gently slough off its outer
envelope as a red supergiant or eject
mass in spurts as a luminous blue vari-


  A 120-volt hair dryer, used gently
from a distance so it doesn't overheat
the glass and warp it, will blow off dew
for perhaps five or 10 minutes. Then
you have to use it again. And again. A 
12-volt auto windshield defogger gun is
somewhat less effective. A better way 
is to apply a little heat continuously.
Heated dewcaps that run off a 12-volt
battery are advertised in this magazine
(one system was reviewed in the May 
1994 issue, page 51.) Or with just a lit-
tle electrical know-how you can make
an antidew heater to any size, shape,


and specification you want, as de-
scribed in the box on the next page.
  Warmed optics can have unexpected
benefits. Dew works its first subtle evils
before you notice anything. The late Wal-
ter Scott Houston used electric warmers
on both the objective and eyepiece hold-
er of his 4-inch refractor. When he turned
off the power, the telescope could lose a
whole magnitude of light grasp before the
objective actually looked dewy.
  "Even on nights when dewing is not
noticeable," Houston wrote, "the star
images seem better with the heaters on
than without them!" This may be be-
cause, contrary to what you might think,
gentle heating keeps a telescope close to 
the temperature of the surrounding air.
After all, the whole idea is to stop it
from growing colder than the air.

  NOT-SO-COLD STORAGE

  The most destructive dewing happens
when a telescope is in storage. No tele-
scope should be closed up and put away
until it is thoroughly dry. Water with
nowhere to escape, or condensation that
forms and evaporates repeatedly in a 
sealed environment over months and
years, may attack optical coatings and
ultimately etch the glass itself.
  How, you may ask, does water get
into an airtight space that was dry when


IN ASTRONOMY appearances often
deceive, and tiny, faint objects fre-
quently surpass flamboyant ones for
closeness and importance.
  For instance, have you ever seen a red
dwarf? These most abundant of stars are
surprisingly hard to find, since they are
intrinsically so dim. Proxima Centauri, 
famous as the closest star to the Sun, ap-
pears lost in the Milky Way swarms at
magnitude 11.1. Barnard's Star in Ophi-
uchus, the nearest star visible from mid-
northern latitudes, is magnitude 9.5. The
next closest is Wolf 359 in Leo, magni-
tude 13.5. Not until we come to the
fourth closest red dwarf do we find one
that's visible even in binoculars.
  Lalande 21185 can be seen these
spring evenings glowing like a dim
ember at magnitude 7.5 in the hind feet
of Ursa Major. It is only 8.3 light-years
away, a little closer than Sirius but 4,000
times fainter. With an absolute visual
magnitude of 10.5 it emits only ~~~80 the
light of the Sun.
  Although dim and obscure, Lalande

the better guides we reviewed-~that will give you a
rough idea of what to expect. Keep in mind, these
numbers are based on a two-parent family with two
kids. For a more exact estimate of how much aid you
may receive, see the work sheets in the College Costs
& Financial Aid Handbook put out by the College
Board (Henry Holt & Co., $16. To order a copy call
800-323-7155).
  When you finish the work sheet, you should have
enough information to make some important deci-
sions. Most readers will probably find that their sav-
ings and estimated financial-aid awards won't cover 
all tuition costs. Indeed, because most financial-aid
packages include loans as part of the package, some
borrowing will more than likely be part of any tuition
equation. Parents not wanting to borrow as much as
the work sheet estimates may decide to cut back on
certain areas of the household budget. Others, who
discover their retirement savings are below what they
should be, may decide that borrowing is the best way
to make up for tuition shortfalls.


THE SMARTMONEY 
PORTFOLIOS

SAVING FOR COLLEGE is a schizophrenic pursuit.
On the one hand you've got to invest aggressively
enough to accumulate thousands of dollars by the
time your child is ready for school. On the other hand
this is your child's future we're talking about: You
can't afford to lose one penny of principal.
  The SmartMoney strategy directly addresses this
inherent dichotomy in tuition planning. Our three
model portfolios should provide an average annual re-
turn of 12 percent over 18 years. Yet we've included
investments that post those gains without taking ex-
traordinary risks.
  How does our strategy achieve these two seem-
ingly opposite goals? Part of the reason is that we have
redefined the conventional wisdom on how parents


has been met so far. Look, rather, for Congress to tackle
the problem once again, either trying to solve it by fiat,
meaning forced centralized storage sites, or relaxing 
the deadlines for disposal.
  The former is unpalatable. But if dumps are not man-
dated, won't the radioactive waste "crisis" be made
worse? The fears are played upon by both sides. To re-
lieve the threat to the public, proponents would quickly
move the waste underground. Opponents would just as
soon see the waste back up while repositories are debat-
ed, and choke the front end of the process, that is, shut
down nuclear power.
  What no one is debating is the health hazard itself.
  Nuclear waste in its present modes of storage is not
very dangerous. The fuel rods are safe in the cooling
pools of power plants; as the pools fill up, the rods are
being moved to concrete casks. The casks, emitting 
great heat but little radiation, are held on-site. (Utilities
don't like this stopgap, of course, and are suing the fed-
eral government for not taking their high-level waste.)
Likewise, the barrels of TRU, guarded behind fences at
DOE reservations, aren't threatening anyone at the mo-
ment. DOE stores high-level liquid wastes there too, 
some of it in leaky underground tanks. The pollution so
far is being contained on the sites.
  It is the hospitals and private generators of low-level
waste that are the most pressed for space. Waste at one
California research facility nearly caught fire after the
1994 earthquake. Urban fires, earthquakes, floods-~
that's the low-level-waste failure scenario, although the
same risks applied when the hospitals' and private com-
panies' storerooms and warehouses were less full. Still,
many may give up their licenses if no solution is found.
  At all such facilities of interim storage, workers' expo-
sure to radiation is monitored. The limit is 5 rems per
year, and in practice the average worker receives about
300 millirems. Leaving aside the meaning of the terms,
the question is whether the workers' risk of cancer is ac-
ceptably low. Most scientists think so.
  The exposure limit for the public living near these fa-
cilities is set 50 times lower than the occupational stan-
dard. Is the public also being protected against cancer?
Most scientists think so. One's risk never disappears en-
tirely. Zero risk, like zero radiation, is unattainable.
  It takes a trust in the authorities, admittedly a tall
order in suspicious times. If one can trust the current
protection standards, backed by inspectors with Geiger 
counters and doctors with health studies, then the nu-
clear waste can stay where it is until society comes to a
consensus. It's a concern, not an emergency.

As the controversy rages, spent fuel rods from nuclear 
power plants smolder in cooling pools like this one.

Samaj, broke off relations with the
Theosophists. His organization hoped
to unify India under the banner of
Hindu revivalism and denounced the
society's embrace of all religions. At
one point, Samajists distributed leaf-
lets in Bombay attacking Olcott and
Blavatsky as untrustworthy foreigners
interfering in Indian affairs.
  When A. P. Sinnett published a book 
of letters he said he had received from 
Madame Blavatsky's Masters, a clergy-
man confronted Madame with evi-
dence that one letter was plagiarized 
from a sermon of his that had been 
published in an American Spiritualist
magazine. Anglo-Indian journalists
rushed to satirize Madame's astral
communications system.

Theosophical headquarters were
moved to Madras at the end of 1882,
and for a time public controversy died
down. The Colonel took up the lecture
tours again. While in London in 1884
he learned that the British Society for
Psychical Research, an organization 
dedicated to the study of paranormal
phenomena, wanted to investigate the
Theosophical Society's activities. The
group included philosopher Henry
Sidgwick, as well as politician Arthur
Balfour (who would become Britain's
prime minister in 1902) and physicist 
Lord Rayleigh.
  Their attention had been caught by
a sensational article in the Times of Lon-
don. Emma Coulomb, the housekeeper
whom Madame Blavatsky had earlier
defended, claimed to possess letters
from her employer instructing her to
fake many of the mysterious happen-
ings that had attracted so much con-
troversy. Coulomb published these let-
ters-~which the Theosophists insist to
this day were forgeries-~in the maga-
zine of Madras Christian College. For
years the society had sparred with the
missionaries. Now the men of the
cloth, it appeared, were about to get
their revenge.
  In one letter, Madame Blavatsky re-
portedly instructed Coulomb to dis-
play a bearded, life-size doll in the 
moonlight so that it could be taken for

he could not openly criticize her dur-
ing the SPR investigation. To do so
would have damaged his own reputa-
tion for integrity and further risked the
good name of the movement to which
he had dedicated his life.
  The investigation nearly destroyed
the Theosophical Society. Madame
Blavatsky, who usually deflected criti-
cism with her famous wit, insisted on
suing for slander. Colonel Olcott, ordi-
narily a jovial and easygoing adminis-
trator, refused to back her lawsuit,
fearing even more public embarrass-
ment for the society. Accusing him of 
treachery, she retreated to her quar-
ters in a rage and announced that she
was on her deathbed. 
  She was, in fact, suffering from a se-
rious liver ailment and nervous ex-
haustion. Colonel Olcott arranged for
her passage on the first ship bound for
Europe. On March 31, 1885, too weak
to walk, she was hoisted in an invalid
chair onto a steamer waiting in the
Madras harbor. She was never to re-
turn to India. Except for one brief, un-
easy meeting in London, she would
never see Colonel Olcott again.
  But to the astonishment of her crit-
ics, Madame Blavatsky's career as a

SWAT commanders and administra-
tors in the seminar. The more they
know about us and what we do, the
better. Here is a chance to teach them
to respect our skills. It is also a golden 
opportunity to sell them on the need
to get us more training and equip-
ment," Bartlett explained.
  Following the seminar was the
Sniper Team Shoot-out, a two-day 
event that pitted sniper teams against
one another in a variety of challeng-
ing courses. Each course was designed 
to test the team's tactics, decision
making, teamwork, conditioning, as
well as marksmanship. Also tested
was their ability to function under
pressure. In keeping with the
Snipercraft philosophy that snipers are
more than just shooters, there was
also a written exam to test observa-
tion skills and general knowledge of
their trade.
  "Given a quality rifle, anybody can
learn to lay in a comfortable position
and shoot bull's-eyes," Bartlett ad-
mitted. "A sniper worthy of his title
is much more than a marksman. But 
as a marksman, he is expected, be it
unrealistic or not, to be perfect under
pressure. In our competitions we be-
lieve in applying all the pressure we
can. The weather, the physical exer-
tion, the head-to-head competition,
performing in front of your peers and
the very nature of our fire courses all
add up to make this a formidable chal-
lenge. Succeed here, and you have
accomplished something you can
build confidence on. Pass these tests
and the real thing becomes just an-
other day on the range."
  The competition was always fierce
but friendly, each team openly
cheered for others to put forward a 
good effort. Downtime was spent

search studies from wound bal-
listic laboratories. The table shown
here well illustrates the less-than-
lethal characteristics of "assault
weapon" wounds.
  And the reality of Black Talon
wounds? Martin Fackler, M.D.,
former chief of the Army Wound
Ballistics Laboratory, has exposed
the voodoo wound ballistics of
ignorant physicians and has stud-
ied the Black Talon. Fackler's
research shows that Black Talon
performs exactly like any other
hollowpoint handgun bullet, ex-
cept in the last 4 of its 18 inches
of travel, where the cutting effect
is a more efficient wounding
mechanism than crushing. For
example, in its last few inches
of travel, a standard hollowpoint
might only bruise or stretch an
attacker's artery, but Black Talon's
sharp edges might cut the artery
causing the attacker to hemor-
rhage profusely and collapse,
ending the attack sooner.
  If Black Talon is marginally
more effective in stopping power
and less likely to ricochet, isn't
that what self-protection is all


about -~ stopping a vicious as-
sailant, without allowing non-ex-
panding and over-penetrating 
bullets to wound innocent neigh-
bors or bystanders?
  Prohibitionist physicians have
planted fear that the sharp edges
of Black Talon bullets might pierce
a surgical glove and injure a sur-
geon, increasing the risk of AIDS
and hepatitis -~ but it is not a
surgical axiom that bullets must be
handled or removed. Additionally,
since the AIDS epidemic began,
"universal precautions" (wearing two
layers of surgical gloves or wearing
Kevlar gloves) are SOP. If we worry
the nasty sharp edges might cut a
surgeon despite those precautions, 
remember that surgeons regularly 
handle sharp objects. They are called 
"needles," "scissors" and "scalpels."

implications of the Waco massacre
was a coroner's inquest held January
in Manchester, England. Twenty-three
of the dead Davidians were British
citizens. The irony did not escape
Coroner Leonard Gorodkin.
  "There has not been one focal
point in the United States to gather
all of the information and present it
to the public and, more importantly
and significantly, present it for the
families of the deceased," Gorodkin
noted. He said he hoped the inquest
would remedy the lack of such a pub-
lic hearing in the United States.
  That may be about to change,
mainly because of the shift in politi-
cal power on Capitol Hill. If the Re-
publican leaders' deeds are as good
as their words, congressional hear-

Flowers in the Field


  The pecan trees come into view
first-~then the house and garden.
The whole place looks enchanted; 
flowers and foliage are coated by the
shimmering, silvery mist of morn-
ing. From the road you can see
bright patches of color edged in gold
by the sun. Gardeners live here.
Good ones. Gardeners named Den-
nis and Ruth Mitchell.
  Ruth, smiling warmly, meets me at
the steps of their home, located just
south of Atlanta's outskirts. "I'm so
glad you came!" she exclaims, then
looks down at my city slicker shoes.
"Oh, my! The dew will ruin those!


ones too, like Iceland poppies, but I
just haven't had any luck with the 
Oriental ones."
  Ruth and Dennis could hardly 
claim to be unlucky with other
plants, however. The poppies are just
one part of the river of plants that
swirls around the house, spills down
the slope in back, and flows into the
woods beyond. Countless roses, iris,
moss pinks, columbines, Johnny-
jump-ups, daylilies, wallflowers, one
of this, a few of those-~an amazing
horticultural zoo spread over 10
acres. Although the property has
been in Ruth's family for more than 
100 years, the garden is only 10
years old, give or take a year. "There
was very little planted-~just around
the house-~when I came back to
Georgia," Ruth says, gesturing.
"Some boxwoods, daffodils-~the old
butter and eggs kind-~and old-
fashioned and species iris. We plant-
ed everything else."
  Dennis emerges from the woods 
at the garden's edge. There is a

Dining in Outdoor Comfort


  When healthy, Shawon Dunston is 
one of the better shortstops in the Na-
tional League, proven by his two All-Star
appearances in his 10-year career with
the Chicago Cubs. We asked Dunston to
rate the top 10 shortstops today, exclud-
ing himself.

1. (Tie) CAL RIPKEN JR., BALTIMORE 
ORIOLES: "Cal is simply amazing with
his [consecutive games] streak. Pride has
a lot to do with it. The reason I have more
respect for him is it's so hard to play ev-
ery day. You get fatigued. To play for 10
straight years without a break is unbeliev-
able."

1. OZZIE SMITH, ST. LOUIS CARDI-
NALS: "He plays every day and has never
been injured. Ozzie has played on artifi-
cial turf for so long. If I'd have been on the
Cardinals, I would have been retired long
ago."

3. BARRY LARKIN, CINCINNATI REDS:
"Some shortstops play defense, some
are good hitters. Barry puts power, speed
and defense together."

4. JAY BELL, PITTSBURGH PIRATES:
"He does everything like Larkin, but just a


POS: "He will get


even better if he can get a good first
baseman in Montreal. If he had Mark
Grace, he'd make only 10 errors a year.
He can hit, run, throw and field."

7. ANDUJAR CEDENO, SAN DIEGO
PADRES: "I see Andujar and myself as
the same kind of player. But you've got to
put it together full time. He needs a little
more effort. Cedeno could be the best
shortstop in the game. I've talked to him,
and he just needs a little more maturity."

8. OMAR VIZQUEL, CLEVELAND INDI-
ANS: "He may be the best fielding short-
stop in the game. His hands are beautiful,
just outstanding. I remember seeing him
in winter ball in 1984 when he was just a
teen-ager. He was good [defensively],
but he couldn't hit."

9. ROYCE CLAYTON, SAN FRANCIS-
CO GIANTS: "He has a chance, like Ce-
deno, to be the best shortstop in base-
ball. He's got great hands. It just takes
time. He has intensity."

10. WALT WEISS, COLORADO ROCK-
IES: "He's a gamer. He's a much better 
player than I thought. He's a good, sure-
handed shortstop."  -~George Castle
can pass, he can defend, he can
shoot. He can do everything well. But I
think the key for the Magic is going to
be Horace Grant. If Horace can give
them some of his knowledge as far as
the playoffs are concerned and keep
them focused and poised, the Magic
will go far. On the other hand, if the
Magic allows the Knicks to intimidate
them with their physical brand of play,
they'll have problems. Let's see if the
Magic is mature enough to handle it.
Grant should really help them in this
area.

INDIANA PACERS-~As Reggie Miller
goes, Indiana goes. If Reggie is hot,
talking trash and really playing his
game, then Indiana has a chance to go
a long way. They're the team that you
don't want to play....You know they're
good, and you just don't want to have
to deal with them because you don't
know exactly how good they can be. I
don't think either the Knicks or Orlan-
do wants to face them in the playoffs.
Indiana is big and physical, and they
can wear you down. Even if they don't
win the series against New York or Or-
lando, the team that does win is going
to be so tired that it will affect their play
in the next series. The Pacers have
Byron [Scott] coming off the bench
shooting very well, the Davis Boys
[Dale and Antonio] crashing the
boards and putting a lot of pressure
on you. If Rik Smits is healthy and can
play as well as he did in last year's 
playoffs, Indiana will put a lot of pres-
sure on either New York or Orlando.

WESTERN CONFERENCE

  Johnson prefaced his picks in the
West by saying: "Danny Manning [of
Phoenix] threw everything for a loop.
With him getting hurt, it's now confu-
sion. You've got three good teams
here, but you can't say one is the fa-
vorite. There is no favorite anymore."

SAN ANTONIO SPURS-~They're
definitely going to be there. I believe 
this is the team that's going to come
out of the West. You have to give re-
spect to the defending champs, but I
think the Spurs are the best in the
West. For two reasons: One, Dennis
Rodman. Two, David Robinson,
who's playing better than he ever 
has. I mean ever. He has never been


Hardaway. The name has a magical
sound to it.
  "He's absolutely phenomenal," says
a fellow magician, Magic Johnson. 
"Really, words don't describe how
great he is and how great he's going to
be. He's one of the three most enter-
taining players in the league right now."
  And to think some people actually
questioned-~some even complained
about-~the Orlando Magic's acquisi-
tion of this extraordinary talent. Would
anyone even consider trading Hard-
away for Chris Webber today?
  Pity those poor Golden State War-
riors. In the 20th-anniversary season of
their only NBA championship, the War-
riors have had the most forgettable year
for a sports franchise in recent memory,
not only being forced to trade Webber,
but having to live with the fact that they


rebounding skills for a guard. Granted,
he's not a great outside shooter-~yet.
He vows he'll become one; he plans to
launch jumpers "by the hundreds" ev-
ery day during the off-season.
  "I can see Penny averaging 22-25 
points, 10 assists, and five or six
boards, maybe even next season," says
Magic forward Horace Grant. "But
what's exciting is the way he gets his
points, assists and rebounds. He's so
exciting out there, like a magician."
  Says Hardaway: "I want to be known 
as one of the greatest players in history.
When people talk about the greats, I
want to be mentioned with Michael Jor-
dan, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird."
  That day may very well come.

Jets quarterback Boomer Esiason,
who's proven he'll be as good in the
broadcast booth as he once was on
the field, unfortunately has no peer
when it comes to inconsistency at the
quarterback position over the last five 
seasons.
  He led the league with 22 intercep-
tions in 1990 and averaged only 12 TDs 
and 15 picks in 1991 and '92. After
throwing for 3,421 yards and complet-
ing 61 percent of his passes in his first
year with the Jets in '93, he sunk to a
58-percent completion ratio with 17
TDs and 13 interceptions last season.
He also saw his December record with
the Jets slip to 1-7.
  With new coach Rich Kotite having


brought in Bubby Brister, it'll be inter-
esting to see what develops. Remem-
ber, Brister was Kotite's No. 2 quarter-
back in Philadelphia, and when Randall
Cunningham slumped, Kotite yanked
him and called on Brister.
  Kotite, Esiason's fifth coach in five
seasons, refuses to speculate, but it's
evident that if Esiason is ineffective,
Brister will get the call.

If last year's NBA draft were to take
place today, the top 10 would look a
little different, according to a panel
of two assistant coaches and one gen-
eral manager:


  Dallas still might have taken Kidd over
Hill because of its desperate need for a
point guard, but there's no question the
Mavericks have been disappointed with
Kidd's outside shooting (he's hovered
around 37 percent most of the season)
and free-throw shooting.
  Early on, it appeared as if the Bucks 
had blown the top pick by taking Robin-
son over Hill. No mistake. Hill's a stud,
but Robinson came on like a seasoned
All-Star about a month into the season.
  The big changes, as the above rank-
ings indicate, take place from the fourth
pick on. Marshall was picked too high,

once told a sportswriter he had just

cently looked more approvingly upon

An Apple from Teacher
As tax-cut fever threatens school budgets
across the country, many districts are
finding it increasingly difficult to fund in-
terscholastic sports. Last week New York
City's board of education announced that
it would eliminate eight junior varsity pro-
grams. And in early April the school
board in Hamler, Ohio, voted to require
students to pay to play-~$150 to partici-
pate in one sport, $120 more for the sec-
ond and an additional $90 for the third.
  So far no one in New York has offered
a solution to the 6,500 students who
would be affected. But in Hamler, 38
coaches from the Patrick Henry School


District will forgo their normal stipends
for one year if the district can't make up
the shortfall. That would allow almost 375 
kids to continue playing for free. The dis-
trict figures to save almost $90,000, and
each teacher will lose between $1,300 and
$4,000-~but their gifts to their students
would be priceless.

During a recent tour of the baseball stadi-

dressing room a visitor inquired about
one sign that appeared to be different 
from the others. "That's Braille," stadium
manager Jose Soto replied, "so the um-
pires will know where to go."

WHILE THE aftershocks from baseball's work stoppage continue to leave
that game turned upside out, inside down and worthy of pen-and-ink comment by
editorial cartoonist John Caldwell, we're grateful to be reminded that rates of
acceleration sometimes apply to something other than greed. In the May issue of
Physics Today, Yale professor Robert K. Adair not only assures us that curveballs
still curve and line drives still slice, but also explains precisely why.
  Adair says that because a baseball usually travels between 60 and 120 mph, a
speed that's neither unusually fast nor unusually slow, the game is played
befuddlingly between "two aerodynamic regimes." This, combined with the
raised stitches on the ball, makes for baseball's occasionally vexing exceptions to 
what would normally be tidy natural laws. In summing up, Adair sounds more
than a little like that laureate of convoluted logic, Yogi Berra. "Simple matters,"
he writes, "are not always easy."


cut that they concluded was the result of
one of the attacks and described her as
"very truthful."
  Yet in the days following Brenda's visit
with the police, a number of things hap-
pened-~and didn't happen-~that explain
how a coach might beat his wife for years
with impunity. In his interview with po-
lice, Dan, after denying most of Brenda's
account of the incident, raised concerns
about publicity and "the reputation of the
football team." For some reason Johnson
assured McCarney and his lawyer that the
sheriff's office "would not notify the me-
dia of this investigation," the report said.
Dan had already called Brenda to say that
if she went public with the latest incident,
he would lose his job and she and their
children would be without support, ac-
cording to the report. Brenda, who hadn't
worked outside the home since 1990, 
soon secured a restraining order but
didn't press criminal charges.
  Last March, after a Des Moines Register
account of the private life of Iowa State's
new football coach forced the university 
to launch a reevaluation of its decision to
hire him, Brenda and Dan released a joint
statement. In it they denied that there had
been anything more than that single inci-
dent. With her estranged husband having 
signed a contract worth as much as
$300,000 a year, the scenes from their
marriage that Brenda had recounted to


detectives a year earlier suddenly hadn't
happened. No, there had never been that
first beating just before the July 1986 mar-
riage. Nor had there been one, as she had
previously reported, five days after the
birth of the first of their three children,
Jillian, in '87, when Dan slapped her face
as she held the baby. Nor had there been
an incident that Brenda said had occurred
on Super Bowl Sunday in '93, when she
suffered a bruised cheek and black eye af-
ter confronting her husband about an af-
fair. The Iowa State administration says it
will honor rather than eat Dan's five-year 
deal-~and Brenda will collect the $3,600-
a-month support payments she was grant-
ed soon after Dan got the job with the 
Cyclones.


  Similarly, the Coxes appeared together
Monday at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadi-
um to read a joint statement denying that
Bobby had struck his wife and calling the
incident an "argument" that "became 
heated." Pamela appeared to have a slight
bruise on her left cheek. In response, the
commander of the Cobb County uniform
division, Col. J.D. Arrowood, said the po-
lice stood behind their report.
  Coaches have suffered from stress
since long before Ohio State's Woody
Hayes slugged an opposing player in the
1978 Gator Bowl, before Northwestern
basketball coach Ricky Byrdsong took his
bizarre midgame stroll into the stands in
1994. But stress is only one element in a
mix that can lead to excessive drinking or
violence. An occupational need to control
is another. "Coaches want to be in con-
trol," says Todd Crosset, a former swim-
ming coach at Northeastern who now 
teaches in the sports-management pro-
gram at Massachusetts. "But the people
we reward for making decisions are ulti-
mately not in control. When the game be-
gins, the athletes are on the field."
  Many coaches have coped sensibly with
stress, calling timeout in their careers
when the pressure became too much to
bear. But as a group, coaches may be at
higher risk than men in other profes-
sions-~not because they're coaches but
because of the traits that coaches are like-
ly to have. "People like police officers,
military people and people in sports-~ca-
reers where competitiveness and aggres-
siveness and control are dominant and
valued-~tend to get involved in spousal
abuse," says Toby Willner, coordinator of
the Coalition of Battered Women's Ad-
vocates in New York City. 

ability at every position. If we could take
two teams to the Pan American Games, 
we'd finish first and second." It is the day
after the naming of the national team that
will win the gold medal in Argentina, and
its pitching staff, in particular, is a happy
embarrassment; Zabala ticks off four of
the nation's top pitchers before getting to
Rolando Arrojo, ace of the Cuban league 
champion team, Villa Clara, who went
12-0 with a 1.85 ERA this season and
beat the U.S. at the 1994 world champion-
ships in Nicaragua. "It was a close game,"
Zabala says, deadpan. "We won 15-2."
  It is a terrible time. Squeezed by an eco-
nomic vise that Castro dubbed the Special 
Period but might well be called the Great 
Depression, Cubans suffer severe short-
ages of fuel, soap, meat, medicine. Asked
how athletes still maintain such a high lev-


the tiles are cracked, and the toilet backs

phone numbers, but they don't work," he
says. Then again, he does have some ad-
vantages. After the announcement of the 
world-beating Cuban team, the commis-
sioner was seen walking out of the stadi-
um with two sandwiches in his hands.
Shoving them under his arm, he pulled
out his keys and unlocked a small, bat-
tered blue Lada station wagon. He had his
food, he had his Golden Age, he had
enough gas to get home.

Miami
He is away from it now. But the best relief
pitcher in Cuban history still can't be sure
what to say, whom to trust, how to be-
have. He squints, ducks his head into his
shoulders. On the escape boat, which was


buoyed by four empty 55-gallon oil
drums, the good water ran short, and he
was so thirsty, he drank from the sea when
his wife wasn't looking, and he kept row-
ing, rowing. Experts believe that only
40% of those who leave Cuba in rafts sur-
vive the journey. What if his boy or wife
had slipped over the side? Euclides Rojas 
would never have forgiven himself; he
would've killed himself, maybe. He sits in
this nice house on the edge of the Ever-
glades, sure of this: He would never put
his family through that again. They were
picked up after 4~~~ days at sea, 67 miles
out of Cuba, by a Coast Guard vessel with
three numbers painted on the side.
  "Seven-two-one," Rojas says. "I'll nev-
er forget it. At least we weren't going to
drown. We saw a lot of empty rafts. After
we were picked up, I saw a woman in the
water, all bloated."
  He and his family spent six months in-
terned at Guant~~namo, his son wheezing
with a constant lung ailment. They had
dropped into the sea off Havana's Morro
Castle at 11 p.m. on Aug. 17-~when U.S. 
policy still would've allowed them to en-
ter the country-but on their third day
out, President Clinton directed that all
refugees be sent to the base. Finally, in
February, all three Rojases were allowed


something is missing. Police on horseback
aren't ringing the field, no one fears his
car will be roasted in a U.S-style flame of
"celebration," the announcer doesn't
threaten hooligans with arrest. When it's
over and Villa Clara is champion of Cuba,
the crowd simply flows onto the diamond
to dance. Mesa is grabbed by dozens of
hands and lifted high; grinning, he is 
tossed over and over into the air. A song
plays: Villa Clara is the champion....
Don't stop.... Go on, go on. Now Mesa is
back on his feet; neighbors and friends 
and people he has never met come to hug
him, and he hugs back. There is no threat,
no fear. The last time a win was celebrat-
ed so purely? In the U.S., maybe Pitts-
burgh, Bill Mazeroski, 1960. In Cuba,
maybe last year.
  "This means a lot, because it's my prov-
ince," Mesa says. "It's where I live, where
people take care of me." He sits in the

93-cubic-foot sealed enclosure built
into the wall below the stairway lead-

adding a vent," Preston notes, "but I
discovered that short of using a vent
large enough for my three-year-old to
climb through, there wasn't much to
be gained." Remarkably, nothing vi-
brates, not even the stair railing.

ALL IN THE FAMILY
I enjoyed "Science Fiction: Stepchild of
Science" by Frederick Pohl (TR Octo-
ber 1994). In naming scientists who
wrote science fiction, it's a pity he didn't
mention Norbert Wiener. During my
time at MIT in the early 1950s, Wiener
was considered a genius; his various
contributions included establishing the
science of cybernetics. When asked why
he wrote science fiction under the
pseudonym W. Norbert, Wiener replied
that it enabled him to keep his profes-
sional writing separate from his science
fiction writing.

CORRECTION:
In "Sheriffs of Scientific Correctness"
(TR February/March 1995), Lang-
don Winner wrote that the Smithso-
nian Institution exhibit "Science in
American Life" had been "the focus
of efforts by the American Chemical 
Society to remove displays that ex-
pressed concern for environmental
damage and social justice." In fact,
the ACS provided funding for the
exhibit despite its earlier concerns
about plans to include materials on
pollution and other social issues in the
exhibit. After "Science in American
Life" opened, it was the American
Physical Society that protested what it
viewed as the exhibit's negative por-
trayal of science. We regret the error.

New standards from the National Academy of
Sciences for teaching high-school science call
for rolling biology, chemistry, and physics 
classes into one course taught over several
years. The goal is to help students tackle real-
world problems, most of which require con-
tributions form several scientific disciplines.

attend a three-week seminar this sum-
mer that will explain the curriculum they 
will implement in the fall. One obvious 
change is that there will be no textbook
for the class, since traditional texts do
not fit the new approach. Instead,
Aldridge's group is creating its own
instruction manuals for teachers and
work packets for students. The materials
will pool information and experiments 
from different science books that are
consistent with the group's content stan-
dards.The teachers will also require stu-
dents to do a considerable amount of
outside reading. Teachers will identify
articles in popular science magazines,
newspapers, science books, even science-
fiction novels.
  Students will be given a set amount of
time each week in class to discuss obser-
vations that they have made in their own
lives. For example, they might ask how
the colors of the sunset are made in the
sky every evening, whether Alka Seltzer
dissolves faster and more completely in
hot water, or why a microwave oven
cooks food so much faster than a con-
ventional oven.
  Finally, lab experiments will take on
greater importance. The focus will be on 
allowing students to devise experiments
to help answer their own observations.
For example, they could set up an exper-
iment to compare how Alka Seltzer dis-
solves in water at different temperatures. 
The teacher could then use the results as 
a springboard to discuss relevant science
concepts.
  Aldridge believes that once these pilot
projects begin to show results, the new
concepts will become the norm. "By the
year 2000," he predicts, "we're going to
see a noticeable change in thousands of
schools around the country."

THE ROLE OF A NEW
MACHINE

Does Technology Drive History?
Edited by Merritt Roe Smith and Leo Marx
MIT Press, $16.95 in paper

BY G. PASCAL ZACHARY

THE parade of "new and im-
proved" products is so rapid to-
day that those who track tech-
nological change are usually too
busy sorting through them to confront
larger questions about the relationship
between technology and culture. Yet
much of what provokes anxiety about
technological change is precisely the
inability, or perhaps the unwillingness,
of sponsors, inventors, promoters, and
consumers to confront those questions.
None is more important, none causes
more worry or even fear, than the view
that machines make history, that our
tools and technologies determine the
nature of our society.
  This view, termed "technological
determinism," has long seduced both
academics and the public. In the intro-
duction to a new collection of essays
entitled Does Technology Drive His-
tory?, Merritt Roe Smith, a historian at
MIT, locates the source of technologi-
cal determinism in "the early stages of
the Industrial Revolution," when, ironi-
cally, the notion inspired not fear but
hope. Supported by relentlessly upbeat
advertising, "technology became idol-
ized as the force that could fix the econ-
omy and deliver on the legendary
promise of American life," he writes.
Advertisers pitched their products not
simply as fixes for specific needs but as
a means to health and happiness. By the
early twentieth century, "technology
had ... become the cause of human
well-being," Smith observes. Technolog-


ical determinism took even deeper root
by mid-century, with weapons of mass
destruction perversely underscoring the
capacity for inventions to make history.
  However, the 1960s proved to be a 
watershed for technological determin-
ists, Leo Marx, a professor of history at
MIT, finds in his essay. For many peo-
ple, the Vietnam War, and the later mis-
calculations that produced acid rain,
Chernobyl, Bhopal, and the possibility 
of global warming, have led to the con-
clusion that technology per se does not
drive history after all. Rather, the driving
force is seen to be the decisions people
make about how to use technology.
There has been a growing realization
that "high technical skills may serve to
mask ... the choice of ends," Marx
writes. Though technological determin-
ism has hardly faded away, this other
way of thinking has begun to gain ascen-
dency. Both academics and citizen-
activists have urged closer scrutiny of
technical choices and a consideration of
the ways in which powerful sponsors
can influence specific innovations.
  For help in explaining the social pres-
sures acting upon technology, histori-
ans and sociologists have drawn on a 
theory called "social constructivism,"
which calls attention to a mountain of
previously ignored evidence that shows


how different cultures have reacted in
vastly different ways to the same inno-
vation. For example, why did farmers 
in the American Midwest embrace new
seeds and cropping techniques earlier
this century while Chinese farmers,
when given the same opportunities, did
not? Why did television spawn a cornu-
copia of commercially driven program-
ming in the United States while in the
Soviet Union the same medium served
up drab, state-controlled shows? Such
case studies amount to a convincing
rebuttal of "hard" technological deter-
minism, a stance epitomized by Karl
Marx's famous maxim: "The hand mill
gives you society with the feudal lord;
the steam mill, society with the industrial
capitalist."
  Social constructivists have also illu-
minated the ways in which individuals
create technologies that reflect their
own biases and needs. Technologies as
diverse as household appliances, mis-
sile-guidance systems, and computers
have resulted from a myriad of social
choices, with innovators facing open-
ended turning points. The first digital
computers, for instance, were greatly
shaped by the pressures of World War
II, when the military needed to perform 
more quickly the voluminous calcula-
tions entailed in charting bomb trajec-
tories. Absent these pressures, engineers
might have stressed from the start the
computer's awesome ability to produce
images on a TV screen. Each path was
open, but because of human choices, 
the number cruncher took precedence
over the image maker.
  In Does Technology Drive History?,
the social constructivist perspective is
taken for granted. Indeed, most of the
contributors are unabashedly impatient
with the still-popular notion that tools,
as opposed to styles of mind, define a
civilization. Peter Perdue, a professor of
history at MIT, demolishes the influen-
tial argument historian Lynn White
makes in his 1962 classic book Medieval
Technology and Social Change-~that
the heavy plough led to the rise of north-
ern Europe's manorial economy, in
which land was consolidated into large

at it long enough to find a grain of truth
on which to hang our "objective" 
response. In some cases, such as in the
Wall Street Journal, Newsweek, and the
Boston Globe, that response consisted
of picking up on Murray's lament that
his theory was wrongfully dismissed by
serious scholars such as psychologists
Howard Gardner of Harvard, Robert 
Sternberg of Yale, and Richard Nisbett
of the University of Michigan not
because it is unsupported but because it
is politically incorrect. Some journalists
went so far as to quote Murray, saying
that clear-headed scientists agreed with
his theories in private but would not
speak out for fear of disturbing the
equal-opportunity police.
  "The science behind The Bell Curve is
overwhelmingly mainstream," wrote
Geoffrey Cowley in Newsweek. "In
short, cognitive inequality is not a politi-
cal preference. It's a simple fact of life."
Cowley provided evidence of this in the
form of a 1984 survey in which 53 per-
cent of social scientists agreed that "the
black-white gap involves genetic as well
as environmental factors." But that find-
ing indicates only that a modest majority
of social scientists think genetics as well
as environmental factors influence intelli-
gence. The Bell Curve, by contrast, con-
tends that genetics swamps environmen-
tal effects to such a degree that different 
ethnic groups must approach life with a 
whole different set of expectations.
  If political correctness has anything
to do with serious critiques of Murray's
ideas, it is not a lot. Social scientists are
not so sure that intelligence can be mea-
sured by any single test, or that it should
be-~and many are sure that it cannot
and should not be measured this way.
In any case, even psychometricians, psy-
chologists who make their living quan-
tifying intelligence and designing intelli-
gence tests, would not agree that intelli-
gence based on a single measure (what
The Bell Curve calls "g") can prove one
group's intellectual superiority over
another. That is Murray's idea.
  All this was made painfully clear by
Gardner, Nisbett, and others in letters to
the editor and opinion pieces in maga-

THIS WEEK WHEN 121,000 HIGH
school seniors file into classrooms
around the country to take the calcu-
lus Advanced Placement examina-
tion, they will need to come armed with 
more than a couple of sharpened No. 2 
pencils and a firm grasp of derivatives;
they will also require the latest that math
technology has to offer. Under new rules
set by the College Board, all students who
take the test must have a hand-held 
graphing calculator. Those who lack this
powerful machine, which graphs complex 
equations, will have to sign a waiver 
stating that they will not challenge
their scores if they do poorly on the exam
because they do not use a graphing 
calculator.
   To apostles of the "calculus-reform


movement," who advocate learning
through technology, graphing calcu-
lators are to calculus students what mi-
crowave ovens are to popcorn lovers;
once the device is used, there is no go-
ing back. "If you don't use this tech-
nology, then you're really teaching as
if you were in the 1940s," says Judith
Broadwin, an A.P. math teacher at Jeri-
cho High School in New York. "The
few people who object to this do so
because they're afraid of it."
  Other teachers, many of them in
public schools, protest that the Col-
lege Board is rushing to embrace
new technology without considering
the many students who cannot afford
an $80-to-$100 calculator. And the
effort required to learn how to use it,
some teachers believe, far outweighs
the benefits. "The students grow de-
pendent on a machine to do all the
work for them," says Joan Harrison,
who teaches A.P. math in Durham,
North Carolina. "And I'm driven nuts
because I'm having to spend valu-
able class time trying to get the stu-


requirement on the basis of, among other
things, discrimination.
  Wade Curry, director of the Advanced
Placement Program for the College Board,
insists that students and teachers have
been given ample opportunity to obtain
and learn to operate the new calculators.
Texas Instruments, the largest supplier of
the machines, has helped finance training
sessions for teachers and has provided 
some 2,000 calculators to 300 schools at a
25%-to-30% discount. Says Richard
Schaar, a vice president at TI: "Equity is
certainly a critical issue, but the graphing
calculator is a relatively affordable solution
to the need for equipment and technology
in the classroom. Think about a computer
system. How many graphing calculators
can you get for the cost of a PC?"
  The controversy will not help this year's
test takers, who will need the calculators for


TEST RUN: Students work with the calculator


  Nightmover ended on the morning of 
Feb. 21, 1994, when Ames left his house in
Arlington, stepped into his Jaguar and
drove into an FBI roadblock a short dis-
tance away. The arrest of Ames and his 
wife came one day before he was sched-
uled to leave for Moscow on CIA business.
The FBI was not about to risk Ames' going
to Russia and perhaps never coming back.
Slouched in the back of the car that took
him to the bureau's office at Tysons Corner,
Virginia, Ames repeated to himself again
and again, "Think ... Think ... Think." He
knew that all sorts of incriminating doc-
uments, including computer disks and
letters to the KGB, were in his house and 
in his computer. It was over.

ON APRIL 28, 1994, AMES WAS SENTENCED
to life in prison. The very next day, he  was
brought to the Tysons Corner FBI office for
debriefing. Officials would begin the
process of questioning him fully about his


that had tracked him down. Mole hunter
and quarry were finally face-to-face.
  Ames nodded to her. "Hi, Jeanne," he
said.
  "Hi, Rick," said Vertefeuille. And for
the first time in a long while, she allowed
herself a smile.

AMES LEANED ACROSS THE TABLE 
and shook hands with each 
of the debriefers, including 
Vertefeuille, although he hesi-
tated for a moment before
shaking hands with Hulkower,
the energetic young prosecutor
who had put him and Rosario in
prison. But then he did.
  Ames made an opening statement. He
had participated in a number of debrief-
ings on the other side of the table, and he
would handle this one in a professional 
manner, as he would have done if he were
still in his former role. The debriefers went


the session, which lasted a few hours, and
ate two sandwiches. The questioning went
on as Guerin led Ames through the history
of his espionage.
  Then the debriefing took a dramatic
and unexpected turn. Ames explained 
how worried he was in late 1985 and early
1986 when the Soviets so swiftly arrested
the agents he had betrayed. He had talked
to the KGB in Rome about it and said that
the sudden loss of agents might lead the
CIA to look for a mole and jeopardize his
safety. The Soviets had asked, What can
we do to help you? Is there anyone you can 
blame? They suggested that if Ames pro-
vided the name of another CIA officer, then
the KGB would plant clues that the inno-
cent person was the mole. The officer 
would be framed.
  Ames looked at Jeanne Vertefeuille,
who sat across the table from him.
  "You're not going to like this," he said,
"but I gave them your name."  ~

would be delayed until April 1996-~after
the critical Christmas buying season. Sega,
which apparently was making its plans
around Nintendo's original schedule, sur-
prised everyone by announcing that its
new 32-bit Saturn would be available im-
mediately instead of in September. Sony,
no stranger to the stratagems of consumer-
electronics marketing, neatly parried with 
its own surprise: a pre-emptive price cut
on the PlayStation-~before the official list
price was even set-~to $299. That posi-
tioned the game system well below the
$399 list prices of the Sega and 3DO
machines and only slightly higher than the

capacity to store VHS-quality

out without suffering the usual loss of
clarity. 
  With all this new power, the medium
might seem to have a lot of potential, but
few game developers last week showed
any sign that they were interested in 
exploring it. The games on display-~even
on the new systems-~were depressingly
unoriginal. Most boiled down to a couple
of thugs (male or female) slugging and
kicking it out, or to various vehicles racing 
through a maze of one sort or another,
avoiding obstacles and obliterating any-
thing that moves. A typical title in this
genre: a 3DO game called Hell: A Cyber-
punk Thriller.
  Even with the price cutting that start-
ed last week-~and is likely to continue
through the holiday season-~the systems
are still far too expensive to tempt con-
sumers used to paying $100 or less for a
game machine with plenty of good soft-
ware. "We do not believe there is a mass
market for any machine that costs over
$200," says Dan Lavin, a senior analyst at
Dataquest, a market-research firm based 
in San Jose, California. "None of these


  The biggest villains in the movie,
however, are the media, especially local
TV newscaster Wayne Satz, who early
on reported the ghastliest accusations
against the McMartins with sensational-
istic relish. From talk-show hosts to
newspaper reporters, the media avidly
portrayed the McMartins as torturers.
Even Ray Buckey's lawyer Danny Da-
vis-~played intriguingly by James Woods
as part camera-ready opportunist, part
righteous upholder of justice-~presumed
the McMartins guilty at first.
  So too did Myra Mann and her hus-
band. "I reacted like everybody else,"
she says. "I thought, `God, what people.'
They looked rather sleazy. Later on I re-
alized it was because they hadn't slept.
They were in terror." The Manns have
been obsessed with the case since 1986,
taking it as a personal crusade. In fact,
they became participants in it. After
Glenn Stevens, one of the prosecutors 
(played in the film by Joe Urla), quit the
case because he felt the McMartins were
being unfairly targeted, Myra Mann be-


gan to tape what would turn out to be 30
hours of interviews with him. She even-
tually turned over the tapes to the court
and was called in to testify about them in
a pretrial hearing. She wound up spend-
ing every day of the two trials (which
spanned three years) in court as an im-
passioned observer. While they were on
the set of the movie last December, the
Manns' Los Angeles house mysteriously
burned down in what police confirm 
was arson: the Manns believe it was re-
lated to the case.
  Indictment has already raised an
outcry among children's advocacy
groups. In a press release, the American
Professional Society on the Abuse of 
Children argues that the film lacks bal-
ance and is "dangerous in its potential
for fueling unjustified skepticism about
the judicial system and about child wit-
nesses." Although APSAC executive direc-
tor Theresa Reid has not seen the film, 
she has read the script and cites as her
main concern "the implication that fan-
tastic elements in a child's account of

ica. However, the measure was criticized 
by Gonzalez, who cited it as the main
reason for his resignation.
  "The measures...put Guatemala at a
disadvantage...especially with El Sal-
vador," says Gonzalez, who had advo-
cated lower tariffs. "What we have to do
is try to avoid all costs for the transaction
of [goods]. The duty is only a cost in this
process and doesn't help increased
growth of exports."
  Guatemala's trade with the United
States, its largest trading partner, last year
increased by 5.2% over 1993 to more
than $2.6 billion, according to the U.S.
Department of Commerce. Trade should
grow again this year at about the same
level, Guatemalan and U.S. officials say.
  Top U.S. exports to Guatemala, which
reached $1.35 billion last year, included
nuclear reactors, boilers and machines;
apparel articles and accessories, mineral
fuel and electric machinery. Top U.S.
imports from Guatemala, which reached
$1.3 billion last year, included apparel
articles and accessories, coffee, edible
fruit and sugar. 
  Best prospects for U.S. business
include computers, hotel and restaurant
equipment, food-processing and packag-
ing equipment, agricultural machinery
and equipment, air-conditioning and
refrigeration equipment, hand and power
tools, and security and safety equipment,
according to the U.S. Department of
Commerce.
  "Guatemala is so oriented toward U.S.
products that U.S. companies have an
advantage from the get-go," says a U.S.
Commerce Department official.

September 1996 whether to remain a

Mexican authorities.

~ Cinema profits down
Cinemark USA Inc., a Dallas-based
theater owner, said earnings were down
28%, largely because of a US$900,000
loss linked to its expansion in Mexico. 
Cinemark has four theater complexes
in Mexico and plans six more this year.

~ Insurance expansion
Chubb Corp. is expanding its hold-
ings in Mexico. The Warren, N.J.,
company increased its ownership in
Central de Fianzas to 100%, chang-
ing the name of the surety and bond

ico Compa~~~~a Afianzadora. Chubb

ance company Seguros Equitativa
by 3% to 30%; the name was changed
to Chubb de M~~xico Compa~~~~a de

~ Dollar payout
Investors redeeming tesobonos will be
paid in dollars. Officials hope the move 
will take pressure off the peso because
the dollars will be paid out of foreign

Investors had been redeeming
tesobonos in pesos and buying dollars
with the proceeds, which impeded ef-
forts to help the peso recover.

the amount of shrimp caught in the
ocean. As a result, total shrimp and
seafood exports have risen from $9 mil-
lion in 1986 to $34 million last year.
Manufacturing. But despite the suc-
cess in agricultural exports, the
strongest growth and revenues have
been generated by exports of garments
and textiles assembled in maquila
plants. The two products increased from
about $30 million in 1987 to $211.5
million last year.
  "We're a very small country that 
doesn't have significant natural
resources," says Gonzalez. "But our geo-
graphical position should [help us] be
trans-shippers and traders."
  One of the main assets Guatemala
offers is a large, hard-working labor force
with an attractive salary level compared
with the United States, Guatemalan offi-
cials say.
  "Our labor is very well-qualified to do
maquila-type jobs," says Giancarlo
Ib~~rg~~~en, general director of real estate
developer Grupo Marbensa. "We have a
very skilled artisan population, and those
are very good skills to have in maquila,
so that's a big advantage."


  Guatemalan authorities estimate the
maquila industry employs approximately 
80,000 people. California-based Levi
Strauss is the largest employer, with
7,000 employees. Other top U.S.
investors include Van Heusen. As much
as half of the industry is owned or oper-
ated by Korean companies, Guatemalan
and U.S. officials say.
  The de Le~~n government views the
maquila industry as key to generating
jobs, especially in the rural areas, Gonza-
lez says. "With 40% unemployment,
basically in the countryside, what [the
government is] aiming at is generating
massive employment, and there it's prin-
cipally the maquila that... can achieve it,"
he says.
Mexico effect. However, the industry
is seeing a slowdown because of a com-
bination of factors. Gexpront reports that
72 maquila companies closed last year,
leaving the total at 328. That's down 
from the high of 500 in 1991, but still
eight times higher than in 1986.
  The slowdown started in 1993 with
charges by U.S. unions that the
Guatemalan maquila industry was under-
paying and overworking its employees,


charges denied both Guatemalan and
U.S. officials. "The Guatemalan
maquilas offered better wage and work-
ing conditions than many other sectors of
the economy and significantly helped
improve overall living conditions in the
country," says the U.S. AID consultant.
  Last year also saw increased competi-
tion from neighboring Mexico, which,
through NAFTA, exports textiles to the
United States duty free. Mexico's attrac-
tiveness compared with Guatemala's
increased with last December's peso
devaluation, Gonzalez says.
Prospects. Other problems affecting
the sector include insufficient infrastruc-
ture, transportation costs, hijackings of
cargo and other crime, Gexpront says.
Yet optimism reigns.
  "While a return to the 100 percent 
growth rates of the past are no longer
likely, the industry should be able to sus-
tain growth rates of 20-plus percent a 
year," says the U.S. AID consultant.
  Guatemalan officials and business
leaders estimate that if non-traditional
exports grow at an average of 22% per
year over the next five years, total non-
traditional exports will reach $2 billion,
creating an additional 380,000 jobs.
  "There are thousands of opportuni-
ties," says an optimistic Santano. ~

says Michael Kramer, Sea-Land's direc-
tor of marketing for the Americas and,
until recently, the carrier's manager for 
Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.
  During late 1993 and early 1994, Sea-
Land and other transport companies suf-
fered a wave of cargo hijackings in and
out of Guatemala's top port, Santo
Tom~~s. After implementing counter mea-
sures such as convoys with guards, the
hijackings declined significantly. To off-
set the increased costs, Sea-Land added a
$200 fee for each container carried 
through Guatemala. Kramer and other
executives suggest the government use
the police or army to increase security
and controls on the roads leading to and
from the port.
Pat on the back. Most U.S. compa-
nies operating in Guatemala express opti-
mism over the future. "Guatemala is its
own worst critic," says DHL's Davison.
"They should be patting themselves on
the back for their accomplishments."
  Adds Julio Ligorr~~a, president of the
communications division of Guatemala-
based Delta Consultores: "The country is
clearly moving in the right direction, with


election of an activist gun-control ad-
ministration and the recent passage of
the Brady bill and a ban on certain
semiautomatic weapons have heated
the discourse to white-hot intensity.
  Some believe the 1994 weapons ban
eventually will provide the Supreme 
Court with an opportunity to make a
definitive statement on the amend-
ment. Wayne LaPierre, executive vice
president of the NRA, says his organi-
zation is looking for some sort of suit-
able test case right now. "Let's get it
over with," he says. "Let's take this to
the Supreme Court and have it out."
But given the passion of the issue and
the deep cultural divide that lies be-
neath it, a definitive high court ruling
may be at least as likely to escalate the
conflict as it is to put it to rest. ~

for their annual convention. The leader-
ship will try to present a unified front
while a few dissidents make a plea for
reform and moderation. One prominent
American who will miss the show is for-
mer President George Bush, who re-
signed his NRA life membership last
week to protest the organization's esca-
lating antigovernment diatribes.
  Image implosion. Since the Oklahoma
City bombing, the NRA's reputation
and legislative agenda have taken some
unwelcome hits. With majority support
in the House of Representatives and
powerful support from the likes of 
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole,

er Newt Gingrich wasn't having 
any of it. "To every Democrat who
wants to be responsible, we are
prepared to sit down and work
with you," he said. "But we're not 
going to tolerate and take without
fighting back totally irresponsible 
adolescent behavior."
  Despite the strong words, Re-
publicans now privately worry
that the Democratic assault on 
their budget could grow deadly.
In fact, polls show that a majority
of voters would consider slowing
the growth of Medicare spending
as a breach of the pledge not to
cut Social Security. "The truth is,
we wish we could have done [this]
after 1996," says a top House Re-
publican staffer. Even so, at least
one key Republican strategist says
he's not worried because he be-
lieves Clinton has abdicated any
claim to leadership. "To say there 
is no governing vision of the 
Democratic party is an under-
statement," asserts William Kris-


tol. "It's even worse than George Bush
was in 1992."
  Big shifts. As the partisan rancor rises,
Republicans insist that they are only
snipping around the edges of the federal
colossus. Total federal outlays-~about
$1.5 trillion this year-~would rise to $1.9 
trillion  in the year 2002 under Domeni-
ci's plan, rather than $2.2 trillion if cur-
rent law remained in effect. Of course, 
those numbers obscure big shifts within
spending categories. Social Security,
Medicare and Medicaid, which account
for just over one third of federal spend-
ing, would continue to grow faster than
total government spending, simply be-
cause of demographic trends and health
care inflation. Outlays for defense, about
one fifth of the budget, would decline
slightly. And spending on nondefense,
nonentitlement programs, which repre-
sent roughly 20 percent of the budget and
include everything from highways to for-
eign aid, would slip 13 percent over the
next seven years, according to the Center
on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal
Washington research group.
  For all their specificity, the Republi-
can budget plans still leave some ques-
tions that will have to be answered as
the debate unfolds. Kasich's plan, for
example, assumes that Washington will 
save $52 billion from reduced growth in
pension and Social Security outlays af-
ter the Bureau of Labor Statistics recal-
ibrates its consumer price index, used to
calculate cost-of-living increases in 
those programs. But the bureau hasn't
said how much it will actually change
the price index, and economists differ


widely on the likely adjustment. The
plan proposed by Domenici counts on
$143 billion in five-year savings off the
projected growth in Medicare. But just
how those savings will be achieved is 
left to a bipartisan commission yet to be
appointed. Notes Allen Schick, a bud-
get expert at the Brookings Institution
in Washington: "In politics, the dirty
work is done by commissions."
  The central political struggle of the
summer may be over whether to in-
clude a tax cut in this year's congres-
sional budget. Clinton's plan contains a
five-year $63 billion tax cut aimed at 
families with children at home or in
college. The Kasich tax package costs
$189 billion over five years, but bal-
loons to $630 billion over 10 years be-
cause many of the tax cuts are "back


loaded." Domenici did not include a 
tax cut in his blueprint, arguing that
deficit reduction must come first. But
in a nod to colleagues Bob Dole of 
Kansas and Phil Gramm of Texas, who
are advocating tax cuts as part of their
positioning for the 1996 presidential 
campaign, Domenici said that if deficit
reduction produces lower government 
interest payments or higher govern-
ment revenues, the "fiscal dividend"
could be used to finance a tax cut. 
Gramm wants to offer an amendment
for a tax cut similar to the House tax
package, although at this point he
doesn't have the votes. Senate Majority
Leader Dole, who has promised that
he will pass a tax cut this year, could
well propose a plan of his own, possibly
phased in over a few years.


"How do we stay competitive," muses
Wiggenhorn, "without killing every-
body?" Others question whether the in-
tensified effort will cause employees to 
become too inward looking. During its
quality push, Motorola concentrated so
hard on reducing defects that some cus-
tomers became dissatisfied because they 
felt the company was ignoring their
needs. To restore balance, the company 
launched the Total Customer Satisfac-
tion campaign. Finally, not every Motor-
ola training course is a rousing success.
Curtis Plott, president of the American 
Society for Training and Development,
argues: "There are many business prob-
lems for which the solution is not train-
ing." When several Motorola business
units supply a single corporation, for ex-
ample, they need a unified strategy.
That's an organizational issue that can't
be addressed through training.
  The best judgment so far, however, is
that Motorola has avoided overtraining
its employees, mainly by aligning educa-
tional efforts with business needs. And
there is growing financial proof at the
company that continuous learning may
be one of the smartest investments em-
ployers and employees ever make. ~

Democrats and Republicans wrangling over wel-
fare should pay a call on Mayor Rudy Giuliani of
New York City. He has shown the way by enforc-
ing two simple reforms in the city and state program for
able-bodied, childless adults called Home Relief.
  Step No. 1 is effective screening. Applicants return for
an extensive interview a week after applying for benefits.
Experienced caseworkers review Social Security num-
ber, place of residence, assets and income and ask what
the applicant has been doing. A caseworker then does a
home visit to check the accuracy of a given address, and
other information is tested against information in com-


puter bases. Here is the big news: Near-
ly 50 percent of rejected applicants did
not reside at the address they gave; 5.5
percent did not even have an address. 
Only nine of the several thousand peo-
ple rejected for false addresses came 
back and claimed an official error. A 
number had unreported incomes or
were not who they said they were. One
man who said he was eligible turned
out to be living in a $1,500-a-month
apartment with more than $14,000 in 
the bank. One woman fled the welfare
office after giving a false name; it
turned out to be that of a welfare fraud
investigator in New Jersey where she
lived and had been prosecuted.


  What was astonishing was that so many people lied.
The Giuliani program found that nearly 60 percent of
the 18,000 who applied over the first three months were
not eligible. Just identifying people who did not merit
full support saved the city nearly 5 percent of outlays.
  The second stage of the Giuliani method is work.
Eligible, able-bodied people are required to look for a
job during the 45-day application process and make 40
job contacts over that period. Those who don't find
work are required to work for New York City for an
average of 23 hours a week, producing quality-of-life
improvements in public places. The prospect of work-
ing for the city seems to have prompted 3~~~ times as
many eligible applicants to find jobs during the applica-
tion period as had found them the year before. The
work requirement has also produced a 27 percent re-
duction in the number of initial applicants, which is
saying something, since this year the weather has been


mild and last year there were 17 major snowstorms that
limited the number of applicants. Those working off the
books who did not wish to give up their work for welfare
gave up welfare instead. Others decided it made more
sense to find a real job that would pay better than the
average Home Relief grant of $325 a month.
  Westchester County, a neighbor of New York City,
was first in the state to try the combination sandwich of
front-end evaluation and workfare. It found substan-
tially fewer people merited welfare. Over a five-year
period, including a recession, Westchester welfare cases
increased by only 1 percent, while other counties' went


up 25 percent to 30 percent.
  New York promises to save much of
the $2 billion cost of its Home Relief
program when these new standards are 
applied to the 244,000 Home Relief 
beneficiaries already on the rolls. And
the city has not stopped there. It will
soon start a finger-imaging system to
ensure that nobody double dips for
benefits under different names. Last
year, random fingerprint tests showed
that about 25 percent of the 1,500 peo-
ple tested were double dipping in both
New York and New Jersey-~a much
smaller proportion than those who are
double dipping in different counties
within New York State.


  New York's program has restored integrity to its sys-
tem without denying benefits to those truly in need.
Indeed, it has helped to make benefits more secure
because they are more defensible. Yet for years now,
anyone expressing concern over waste, fraud and abuse
in the welfare system has been automatically tagged an
insensitive oppressor of the poor. Die-hard welfare ad-
vocates, of course, are not impressed. They consider any 
denial of benefits as cruel and any added steps to deter-
mine eligibility as unfair. But President Clinton, who
supported this program and its wider applicability to
other states and cities, has a better grasp of its relevance
to trust in government. "Anytime you can reduce the
number of people on any public program who aren't
qualified to be on it," he said, "[you] bring a sense of
integrity, and taxpayers don't feel they are being ripped
off." Now let's apply the same technique to the far larger
welfare programs that operate under federal rules. ~


immensely impoverished after her first
flush of material well-being. It wasn't 
just the disappearance of her milieu-~
that was obvious-~but the feeling that
she had, somehow, been had. The Amer-
ican supermarket tomatoes didn't taste 
at all like the rare genuine item back in
Romania. American chicken was taste-
less. Mass-produced furniture was built
to fall apart. Her car, the crowning glory
of her achievements in the eyes of folks
back home, was only three years old
and already beginning to wheeze and
groan. It began to dawn on my mother
that she had perhaps made a bad deal:
She had traded in her friends and rela-
tives for ersatz tomatoes, fake chicken,
phony furniture.
  Leaving behind your kin, your
friends, your language, your smells, your
childhood, is traumatic. It is a kind of
death. You're dead for the home folk
and they are dead to you. When you
first arrive on these shores you are in
mourning. The only consolations are
these products, which were imbued with
religious significance back at home. But
when these things turn out not to be
the real things, you begin to experience
a second death, brought about by 
betrayal. You begin to suspect that the
religious significance you attached to 
them was only possible back home,
where these things did not exist. Here,
where they are plentiful, they have no
significance whatsoever. They are inan-
imate fetishes, somebody else's fetishes,
no help to you at all. When this real-
ization dawned on my mother, she
began to rage against her new country.
She deplored its rudeness, its insensi-
tivity, its outright meanness, its indif-
ference, the chase after the almighty
buck, the social isolation of most Amer-
icans, their inability to partake of warm,
genuine fellowship, and, above all, their
deplorable lack of awe before what they
had made.
  This was the second stage of grief
for her old self. The first, leaving her 
country, was sharp and immediate,
almost tonic in its violence. The second
was more prolonged, more damaging,
because no hope was attached to it. Cer-
tainly not the hope of return.
  And here, thinking of return, she
began to reflect that perhaps there had
been more to this deal than she'd first
thought. True, she had left behind a lot
that was good, but she had also left
behind a vast range of daily humilia-
tions. If she was ordered to move out of

How technology created the urban underclass


The story of automation's impact on
African-Americans may be prophetic of
what lies ahead for the rest of the work-
force. In the early years of the 20th cen-
tury more than 90 percent of the black
population of the United States still lived
below the Mason-Dixon Line, and the vast 
majority was tied to agriculture.
  Then, in 1944, an event took place
in the rural Mississippi delta that was to
change the circumstances of African-
Americans forever. On October 2 an esti-
mated 3,000 people crowded onto a cot-
ton field just outside of Clarksdale, Mis-
sissippi, to watch the first successful
demonstration of a mechanical cotton
picker. The onlookers were awed by the
sight. Each machine could do the work of
50 people. For the first time since blacks
had been brought over as slaves to work
the agricultural fields in the South, their
hands and backs were no longer needed.
  The push of mechanization in South-
ern agriculture combined with the pull of
jobs and less overt discrimination in the
industrial cities of the North to create
what Nicholas Lemann called "one of the
largest and most rapid mass internal
movements of people in history." More
than 5 million black men, women, and
children migrated north in search of work
between 1940 and 1970.
  Although most African-Americans
were unaware of it at the time of their
trek north, a second technological revo-
lution had already begun in the manu-
facturing industries of Chicago, Detroit,
Cleveland, and New York that once again
would lock many of them out of gainful
employment. In the mid-1950s, automa-
tion began to take a toll in the nation's
factories. Hardest hit were unskilled jobs
in the very industries where black work-
ers were concentrated. Between 1953 and 
1962, 1.6 million blue-collar manufac-
turing jobs were lost. In The Problem of
the Negro Movement, published in 1964,


civil rights activist Tom Kahn quipped, "It
is as if racism, having put the Negro in
his economic place, stepped aside to
watch technology destroy that place."
  Companies started to build more
automated manufacturing plants in the
newly emerging suburban industrial parks.
Automation and suburban relocation cre-
ated a crisis of tragic dimensions for
unskilled black workers in the inner cities.
The newly laid interstate highway system
and the ring of metropolitan expressways
being built around cities favored truck
over train transport of goods, providing
a further incentive to relocate plants to
the suburbs. Finally, employers anxious 
to reduce labor costs and weaken unions
saw relocation as a way to create dis-
tance between plants and militant union
concentrations in urban neighborhoods.


Eventually these same anti-union feelings
pushed companies to locate plants in the
South, in Mexico, and overseas.
  The corporate drive to automate and
relocate manufacturing jobs split the
black community into two distinct eco-
nomic groups. While many blacks were
able to take advantage of the loosening
grip of outright discrimination and join
the middle-class mainstream of American
life, millions of unskilled African-Ameri-
can workers and their families became
part of what social historians now call an
underclass-~a permanently unemployed 
part of the population whose unskilled 
labor is no longer required and who live
a marginal existence, often as welfare
recipients or in the underground econo-
my of drugs and crime.

aided and abetted the literary delinquency of minors. On
MTV Liz Phair, Lemonhead Evan Dando, and Speech of
Arrested Development have dusted off their freshman-
comp notebooks and shared their wit and whimsy with
celebrity-conscious scholars across America. While it
might seem incongruous that the channel most responsi-
ble for shortening the American attention span would sud-
denly promote something akin to book learning, reduc-
ing the soliloquy to a sound bite is actually in keeping with
MTV's agenda of serving as a cultural Cuisinart. Besides, 
by committing airtime to such purportedly vocabulary-
expanding fare, MTV can claim that it offers "educa-
tional programming" next time some congressman tries
to blame a serial killing on Beavis and Butthead.
  Though today's plugged-in poets think they've dis-
covered fire, Rock Lit actually has a rich and
hilarious history, which begins where so many 
other pop music shaggy-dog stories do: with the
Beatles. In 1964, as sales for Beatles-related chazzerai


went through the roof, a cunning British publisher com-
missioned John Lennon, "the smart Beatle," to write a 
book. Few accounts remain, but the story might have
gone something like this: As his deadline approached,
Lennon panicked, having committed to paper only some
random backstage ruminations. When the fateful day
finally arrived, Lennon turned in several notebooks full
of sloppy sketches and nonsense verse. The publisher,
having already spent millions of pounds promoting the
book, had no choice but to release it. Everyone, includ-
ing Lennon, was prepared for a massive critical and com-
mercial disaster. 
  Remarkably, In His Own Write was a sensation on
both sides of the Atlantic. "He writes like a Beatle pos-
sessed.... Inspired nonsense," proclaimed the New York
Times Book Review. Lines like "'Speak up, come forth,
you ravel me,' / I potty menthol shout" brought frequent
comparisons to Lewis Carroll, Edward Lear, and the
author of Ulysses, although hindsight reveals Lennon's
style to be more Joyce Jillson than James Joyce.
Nevertheless, in March 1964 In His Own Write won the
prestigious Foyle's Literary Prize. In his acceptance speech


Lennon mumbled, "Thank you very much, you've got a 
lucky face," then fled. He was now, as Paul would later
sing, a "paperback writer."
  Bob "Get sick, get well, hang around an inkwell"
Dylan was actually the first rock personality to be treat-
ed as a literary figure. He laid the groundwork by chang-
ing his surname "Zimmerman" to "Dylan" in honor of
Dylan Thomas before dropping out of the University of
Minnesota. Once his recording career was under way,
Dylan was celebrated as a messiah for his fanciful lyrics
alone; the New York Times called him "the poet laureate
of young America." By 1966, though, Dylan had been
upstaged not only by Lennon but also by the publication
of Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me, a novel
by his friend and fellow folksinger Richard Fari~~a, who
was killed in a motorcycle accident before he could go
electric and get baptized. Stung by his competitors' break-
throughs, Dylan rose to the challenge and signed with 
Macmillan.
  Although he told interviewers his manuscript was


Dylan finally agreed to publish Tarantula in 1971 without
Bob's "changes." Needless to say, after more than half a
decade of hype the results were disappointing, prompting
the publisher to include a preface practically apologizing
for the book: "Bob has always been out ahead, working
in ways which can be hard to understand." Those read-
ers not blinded by bathtub acid were completely befud-
dled, and the book met with overwhelming critical dis-
approval.
  But reviewer reprobation was rare. By and large, the
only negative assessments that greeted rock performers'
printed expressions came from doddering holdovers in the
mainstream media. Elsewhere, musicians-cum-muse
chasers sallied forth and an entire publishing industry
rose up to boost their literary efforts. Thus was born the
"rock critic," a pop-culture oracle whose mediation was
needed to interpret the increasingly baroque blathering
offered up as entertainment.
  In 1968 came the book that would become the essen-
tial text in defense of the new pop literature: Richard
Goldstein's The Poetry of Rock. Essentially a reprinting 
of song lyrics by artists as various as Phil Ochs, Paul

Dispatches

to infiltrate a J.D.L. splinter group
known as SOIL (Save Our Israel Land),
whose members were suspected of hav-
ing set off bombs in an effort to thwart 
a peace accord. Fitzpatrick has said he
undertook the role because it was the
"moral thing" to do. Wearing a body
mike, Fitzpatrick gathered information
that led to the arrest and conviction of 
two Jewish militants, Victor Vancier
and Bruce Berger, for plotting the
bombing of the Egyptian tourist office
in New York. After the indictment of
Qubilah Shabazz, Vancier-whose truth-
fulness was questioned in 1979 by a 
federal judge-told reporters that he
and others had wanted only to cause
property damage but Fitzpatrick had
urged them to kill. According to
William Kunstler, Fitzpatrick not only
egged on the SOIL members-supplying 
the dynamite while saying he hoped 
it would kill or maim-but was also
promised more than $10,000 by the
F.B.I. for his work. Dan Scott says
Fitzpatrick was a young idealist who
saved lives at a delicate time-perhaps 
a hero. 
  After the Vancier-Berger trial, Fitz-
patrick was enrolled in the federal wit-
ness-protection program under the name


jewelry, leather jackets, fast cars, and
gaming tables, Gordon wrote, and he
once mentioned that he had gone to
school with Malcolm X's daughter. He
said "she was not a close friend. He
said she was a quiet loner who drank
by herself often." Gordon says she was
intrigued by Fitzpatrick's intellect and
ability to "grasp complex scenarios."
But she found him "kind of a thug,"
"too slippery."
  Fitzpatrick was married a second time,
for eight months, in 1991. He went to
work for several gold and rare-coin deal-
ers but filed for bankruptcy in April
1993, with debts of more than $70,000.
In October 1993, he left a suburban-
Minneapolis employer called Investment
Rarities-the company told police he was
fired-and a dispute ensued over whether
he had given or sold the names of cus-
tomers to competitors. A police com-
plaint report said Fitzpatrick had threat-
ened to "expose" the company's prac-
tices, and claimed to be in the witness-
protection program "for killing a mafi-
oso." In November 1993, Fitzpatrick and
others were arrested on drug charges
at the Minneapolis apartment of Har-
lan Rosenfeld, another coin dealer. Be-

passion that men like Pennant-Rea seem 
capable of lavishing only on their mis-
tresses (and only when they have no in-
tention of leaving their wives). For ex-
ample: "Very dearest ME, yesterday has
left me warm and loving, where once I
was closed down and cold. Thank you
for that, with all my heart." Within two
weeks, he would sign another letter 
"with eternal love." Soon afterward he
wrote, "I was thinking back to a lunch
when you were there.... You were
looking very austere in black. The
knowledge that I now possess-that you 
probably weren't wearing any knickers-
was wonderfully distracting." He seemed
to relish the illicit nature of the affair.
On May 21, he wrote, "An outsider
would say that what we are doing is
crazy: distance, danger, everything is
against us. And part of me would have
to agree with that view."
  While this was going on, Pennant-
Rea's Economist was supporting anti-in-
flationary economic policy and, to the
bitter end, the ultimately disastrous ex-
change-rate mechanism in Europe. Staff
members remember his peculiarly vigor-
ous support at this time of David Mel-
lor, a Tory minister who'd had to resign
after trouble over a mistress and other


things. In 1993-about a year after Mary
Ellen had moved to England-Pennant-
Rea was, astonishingly, appointed to the
number-two job at the Bank of England.
  Ordinarily, this would have been filled
by someone from within. But at No. 10
Downing Street the feeling ran deep that
an outsider was needed to provide a 
fresh perspective and to serve as a coun-
terbalance to Eddie George, the bank's 
very forceful governor. And so Sarah
Hogg, now working as the prime minis-
ter's chief policy adviser, reached out to
The Economist and tapped her old friend
for the job. Eddie George wasn't in-
formed until the last minute.
  It was an awkward fit. Not only did
Pennant-Rea have little supervisory
banking experience, but he was the
most reviled kind of outsider. "The
bank doesn't really approve of journal-
ists, or the way journalists think, or the
way they do their job," said Stephen
Fay, the author of Portrait of an Old
Lady, a book about the bank published
in 1987. "It believes in discretion, ma-
nipulation-I'm thinking in terms of
defining an objective and chasing it rig-
orously. They like to think of them-
selves as being single-minded." What
were Pennant-Rea's qualifications for

  Continuing to read, Love tries to wrap
her daughter in the white robe that bare-
ly clings to the edges of her breasts.
Handing me the doll, Frances Bean
climbs higher on Love's lap and hangs
on every word. The child places her
tiny hands on her mother's cheeks and
listens to the last lines read to her in
that ragged, loving, rocked-out voice.
"The spell was broken," her mother
finishes, knowing the lines by heart,


ple: "a swaggering, tough little slut."
  Love's Kinder-slut persona is primed
and ready by the time I catch the last
leg of a recent Hole tour in Salt Lake 
City. As I wander around the temple
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat-
ter-Day Saints, located in a 10-acre
square in Salt Lake City, I can't help 
but wonder who will show up for Hole's
concert tonight. The young people here
are so well scrubbed and polite that
I can't imagine them singing along with
anything other than Mormon hymns.
Stationed around Temple Square are 
lovely young girls from all over the
world, referred to as "sisters," who 
are doing their missionary work for
the church. Flight attendants for the


ancestral angels of this faith, they pi-
ously dispense information about the
holy pioneers who settled in this val-
ley in 1847.
  Even in Salt Lake City, it turns out,
Courtney Love and Hole can pull in
a crowd. "Hers is the heart of the
rock 'n' roll audience," Danny Gold-
berg, who once managed Nirvana as
well as Hole and is now chairman 
and C.E.O. of Warner Bros. Records,
tells me. "You meet 14-year-olds and 
they're all into Hole. It's not just a
cult. It's not just colleges. It's not just
critics. She's appealing to the heart
of the MTV mainstream rock audience.


It's not just based on one song. It's
her. There are very few women who
have ever done that.... My daugh-
ter, Katie, who is four and a half, of-
ten says she wants to be like Courtney
when she grows up," Goldberg con-
tinues, laughing nervously.
  "I'm a Courtney Love fan because
I think she's a woman who goes be-
yond the limits of anything to say what
she wants to say and to do what she
wants to do," a chubby teenager named
Holly tells me just before the concert
begins in a small hall on the shore of 
the Great Salt Lake. Along with hun-
dreds of other sweet-faced girls and
tough-talking boys, she is getting revved
up for her idol's entrance. "I think


she's been through hell and back," says 
Holly. "And she's survived!"
  Suddenly the crowd lets loose with
a pulsating roar. I look up and see
Love, in a girlishly pink getup, stag-
ger onto the stage full of Stoli and a
couple of weeks' worth of road-weary
attitude. Her band-the beautifully
aloof bass player, Melissa Auf der
Maur (who replaced Kristen Pfaff af-
ter her death from an overdose of hero-
in last year), guitarist Eric Erlandson
(his stoicism tested tonight by the news
of his father's death), and drummer
Patty Schemel (calm, kick-ass, the keep-
er of the rhythmic flame)-grab their


instruments and wait for Love's
signal to let the music rip. Hold-
ing a stuffed Barney dinosaur in
one hand and a Dunhill ciga-
rette in the other, she pauses to
stare down at the throng of row-
dy boys crowding the stage be-
low her, then smirks at their crude
innocence and drops the Barney 
amid the trademark array of
broken dolls that adorn the stage
around her. (Love's song "Doll
Parts" has become the latest
teen anthem for pubescent girls
terrorized by their own tender, 
morphing bodies.) Ready to
mosh-an activity that entails

makes a big difference when you're a
widescreen laserdisc lover. The latest
35-inch entrant is Mitsubishi's top-of-
the-line CS35803, a feature-packed
tabletop set that comes at a suggested
price of $3,199. Any 35-inch direct-
view set this costly better perform well
because, let's face it, you can get some
fine 45- to 50-inch rear-projection sets
at this price, as "Big-Screen Brouhaha"
(Feb.), our rear-projection shootout
showed. 
  If it's features you're looking for,
you'll like what you find with this
Mitsubishi. For example, a common fea-
ture on sets today is channel lock. This
set takes the idea a step further with
parental lock. This allows you to lock
out either individual channels or access
to the entire TV, and only a four-digit 
code will reaccess viewing. It's a fail-safe
way to prevent kids from watching too
much TV, although it may not do much
for your parental popularity rating. 
There is a Super Quick View function
that allows you to program in your
favorite 10 channels, then view them
instantly with the touch of a button.
The set also has picture-in-picture, but
adds a couple of twists; in particular,
snap shot and replay functions.
  However, the set's most useful and
interesting feature is the long awaited


offers its own custom look to the basic
StarSight display and feature package. 
  The guide appears on the screen
with a touch of the remote, and is intu-
itive and easy to use. While watching a
particular channel, you can use
StarSight's browsing function to show
what programs are on other channels,
how much time remains on any of the
shows, and even what the shows are
about. With the Mitsubishi set, you'll
also receive a fuller description than
with the Zenith version of the StarSight

dethroned.
  Besides playing laserdiscs, the CLD-
S104 has one of the new separate draw-
ers-within-a-drawer for five-inch music
CDs. As a combi player, it also handles
CD-Video discs and VSDs (video sin-
gles), eight-inch LDs and 12-inch 
laserdiscs.
  It's a breeze to hook up. Plug it into
an outlet, and run the left and right

RCA jacks for audio out to a surround
processor, an audio/video receiver or a 
monitor. A single composite video cable 
connects to the video output and heads


to the video in jack on your processor,
receiver or monitor.
  Operation couldn't be simpler
either. There's nothing happening on
the front panel except basic open/close
for the CD or LD drawer, plus controls
for play, fast forward, review, stop,
pause, and power. The rest of the func-
tions are on the remote, which does not
feature a jog/shuttle dial. The remote
can freeze single frames and advance
frame by frame on CAV discs only. And
it has skip, for finding the start of songs
or movie chapters, and scan, which is
digital fast forward. The scan feature,
however, leaves something to be
desired. Sometimes the frames jarred so
much I couldn't tell what I was looking
at. For moments such as these, there is
clear scan: Hit the display button and
then scan forward or in reverse, and the
machine plucks an image from every 10
or so frames and holds it clearly so you
can see where you're going.

class home theater experience and,
thanks to the inclusion of dual-purpose
left and right main channel speakers,
satisfying stereophonic performance as
well. Considering the number and qual-
ity of the individual components sup-
plied with the Synthesis 3, the price of
admission does not seem unreasonable.
For your $18,900, you get a pair of S3M
cinema and music speakers for the front
left and right channels, an S3C center
channel, a pair of S2A dipole effects
speakers, and a pair of S3S 12-inch sub-
woofers. The center-channel speaker
can be configured vertically or horizon-
tally, as you choose. You also get an
SDP-1 surround-sound processor, which
is essentially a modified version of
Lexicon's CP3-plus, and S650 and S400 
power amplifiers, which deliver a total
of 1,050 watts into 8 ohms, and an S3-
SPP signal processor/equalizer.
  We ran all this audio hardware with
our video set-up, which consisted of a
Mitsubishi VS-1250 front projector, a
Dwin LD-2 line doubler, a Da-Lite


Model C screen, a Pioneer CLD-97
laserdisc player, and an Audio Alchemy
v1.1 digital/analogr converter for pro-
cessing the audio bits. The set-up was
wired with Monster Cable speaker wire
and interconnects, and Straight Wire
SilverLink II video cable.
  A number of the components in the
Synthesis 3 are derivations of JBL pro-
fessional theater products, which are
installed in nearly 70 percent of the
movie theaters in this country and built
to standards higher than one would
normally associate with consumer
equipment. And like real movie theater
set-ups, the Synthesis 3 utilizes horn
tweeters in the front, center and effects
speakers. The standards for home THX 
certification require that treble disper-
sion be controlled only in the vertical 


  Despite the nuts-and-bolts quality of
the components, the Synthesis 3's most 
formidable strength is its ability to be
optimized, via the supplied S3-SPP sig-
nal processor/equalizer together with
JBL's proprietary computer program and
a technician trained to calibrate the sys-
tem for each customer's specific home
theater environment. Although some of
the Synthesis 3's qualities-~dynamics,
detail, image localization-~were obvi-
ous from the moment we unpacked and
hooked everything up, the calibration
and equalization procedures undertak-
en at our test facility by Synthesis
Eastern Sales Manager Eric Leicht (see
sidebar) helped the system to dial in a
level of home theater realism that set a 
new standard in our reference room. 
Tonal balance, from midbass to upper
treble, was refined and correct, with no
part of the frequency range calling
attention to itself. Integration between 
the speakers was flawless. The transi-
tion of sonic information from one
speaker to another was accomplished 
seamlessly, heightening the sense of
movie realism.
  As noted, the Synthesis compo-
nents were derived from JBL's pro-THX
applications, a fact that became evident
when we pushed the system at high vol-
umes for prolonged periods. While 
other high-powered components have,
under extreme conditions, compressed 
the dynamic peaks of blockbuster
soundtracks, the Synthesis encom-
passed major swings in volume without
ever breaking a sweat. Watching films
that have hectic action sequences that 
take place simultaneously with calmer
scenes are well served here, as the JBL 
system properly delineates each 
sequence while preserving the integrity
of the cinematic whole. JBL's matched 
system approach allows the Synthesis 3
to deliver a greater range of dynamic
contrast than would be possible if amp

Blue Sky

1994. Jessica Lange, Tommy Lee Jones; dir.
Tony Richardson. Surround, cc. (R) 101
min. priced for rental. Orion.
  The title of Blue Sky refers to an
Army project to measure radioactivity
from atom bomb tests, which is danger-
ous even when the weather looks fine.
The family of Hank Marshall (Jones), a
major assigned to the project in the
early '60s, is in a similar state. His wife
Carly (Lange), despite two teenage
daughters, has remained an adolescent
obsessed with movie-star glamor. Her
volatile behavior threatens Hank's
career, already in jeopardy because he
won't toe the line on nuclear testing.
  In his final film, director Tony
Richardson paints a detailed portrait of
a troubled family in which love is not


escape the corruption of Paris. He
arrives to find a brutish sheriff, multi-
ple murders, lewd behavior in the
streets, ignorance and intolerance
rampant, and the local priest (Holm)
making hay with the ladies. And the
local big shot (Nicol Williamson),
whose family takes dysfunctionality to
the next level, shows an unusual inter-
est in Courtois' latest case, in which
the defendant is a pig (of the four-
footed persuasion).
  The Advocate, a ribald, wildly
entertaining British import, is set in
1452, when the Inquisition held sway
and animals were attributed souls-~and
legal shenanigans had begun to turn
trials into major entertainment events.
Writer and director Leslie Megahey
plays this as a modern story with
medieval details. The style seems
anachronistic, but it maximizes the

while closer objects and obstacles would be 
identified using words. It may be possible to
eliminate the need for guide dogs and
canes, replacing them with sonar signals and
spoken words.
  To date the researchers have only created
maps for the campus where they've been
working. However, it should be possible to
use any electronic map of any geographical
location. Furthermore, the five test subjects
(Golledge and four others, only one of
whom is visually impaired) have only used a
small area of the campus. This area consists 
of a network of short, straight paths inter-
sected by other paths and is generally de-
void of large obstacles and structures that 
would reduce the consistency of signal ac-
quisition. The end of each path is marked
by a stationary satellite signal receiver emit-
ting virtual tones.
  Returning sight to those who have lost it
may not be possible for modern science, but
through technologies such as VR people
with visual impairments may find new ways 
to navigate through the world. They would
no longer need to rely on the assistance of 
friends and strangers to direct them to their
destination. They would no longer have to
worry about becoming an imposition on the 
world. The research being done on 3D and
textured sound, along with new ways of de-
termining a person's position in an environ-
ment, might give people with visual impair-
ments the freedom to find their own way.

RIDE THE BUS
People take a great deal for granted as they
wander through their daily lives. Take go-
ing to work, for example. Getting up and
going to work in the morning is an easy
thing for most people to do. Some drive,
others take public transportation. They all


get to where they're supposed to be easily
enough.
  But what if you don't have a car and can't
figure out how to use a bus? All those buses
with all those routes and stops can be con-
fusing. It's a miracle that anyone can figure
out how to use the system.
  Well, some people can't, at least not with-
out a good bit of help. There are millions of
people with mental disabilities who just
can't figure out all those buses, routes, and
stops. Trying often makes them nervous
and confused. Of course, social-service pro-
grams can help train people to use the bus
systems, but those programs are often diffi-
cult to find and always cost the providing
agencies a lot of money and time.
  Travel training is a goal-oriented affair
usually accomplished in the following man-
ner: Students and coaches travel back and
forth over a particular bus route until the
student learns and becomes comfortable 
with taking that bus. The process often in-
volves repeating the stages of bus riding (in-
cluding money exchange, seat selection,
identification of destination, and departure
points) over weeks and, perhaps, months.
However, a more cost-effective, time-effi-
cient way of conducting this training has
been developed.
  Lyn Mowafy is the project director for 
the University of Dayton's (Ohio) Train to
Travel Project. The project was originally
designed to help severely mentally disabled
junior and senior high-school students learn
to take public transportation. Through the
use of individual head-mounted displays
(HMDs), which provide the look and feel of a
real bus ride (including reproduction of ac-
tual scenery), the designers wanted to pro-
vide job-trained students with a new way to
learn about riding a bus.
  In the past, teachers were given the task
of providing travel training to students who
required it. But teachers often felt over-
worked and undertrained for the job. This
lack of ability and resources often left stu-
dents with no way of getting from their
homes to their jobs other than the paratran-
sit services provided under Americans with
Disabilities Act. Miami Valley's Regional
Transit Authority (RTA) (Dayton), finding
this arrangement exorbitantly expensive,
approached the university and decided to
fund their Train to Travel project. Accord-
ing to Carla Lakatos, director of planning
and marketing for the transit authority, the
rationale for the RTA's decision was that if
more people could use the regular bus sys-
tem, the more expensive door-to-door ser-
vices would be left to those who really need
them.
  Before students enter the virtual bus,
they are given a course in bus-riding basics
using a multimedia program on a Macintosh

among a group of scientists and researchers
searching for a scientific explanation behind
the healing effect of dolphins. In 1991, he
founded the AquaThought Foundation in
Torrance, Calif., a privately funded academic
research organization that studies the neu-
rological impact of human-dolphin interaction.
  To assist in their research, Cole and his
colleagues at AquaThought developed a VR
experience called Cyberfin, which is prob-
ably the closest thing you can get to meeting
a dolphin face to fin without getting wet.
Cole and his colleagues created Cyberfin to


simulate a dolphin encounter out of the wa-
ter, hoping to produce brain waves similar
to those that occur in humans after an actu-
al dolphin swim.
  Cyberfin has quickly evoloved from a
crude research tool built in a garage to a
piece of commercial, location-based enter-
tainment. A prototype of Cyberfin (Figure 2)
made its debut at SIGGRAPH 1994 (Orlando,
Fla.), before long lines of VR enthusiasts who
waited two hours or more to experience this
virtual swim with the dolphins. If the crowd
is any indication of the system's popularity,
Cyberfin could be one of the hottest VR ex-
periences to hit the mainstream.
  Cyberfin delivers all the sights, sounds,
and most important, the intense feeling of
an underwater encounter with dolphins. To
experience Cyberfin, you lie on your back
on a liquid crystal-filled mattress. Through
VR glasses, you view a 3D underwater scene
presented on a C-20 collimated monitor. 
The eerie and mournful sound of dolphin
song comes over two huge speakers placed
next to your ears. The sound vibrates deep
in your bones. Suddenly, dolphins appear.
They swim playfully, darting in and out of
your view. One swims right by your face,
making eye contact. Soon, you are swim-
ming with the group around a beautiful un-
derwater reef. After a few minutes, the dol-
phins encircle you in a gesture of farewell.
  When it's over you feel delighted, elated,
and a little wigged out. According to Cole,
that's exactly how you should feel. "In reali-
ty, swimming with a dolphin can be over-
powering. It's not a casual swim. You get
out of the water and you feel different."
  The impact of an actual dolphin encoun-
ter, says Cole, lies in dolphin echolocation
energy, the powerful sonar dolphins use to
navigate in the sea. Cole theorizes that this
energy, which can be as strong as 2,000
watts, has something to do with how dol-
phins heal. "That's enough energy to cause
changes in cellular membranes, which
would change biomolecules. You could com-
pletely rearrange a living organism using
that kind of sound."
  Cyberfin employs some unique technol-
ogy to deliver the feeling of echolocation
energy and the overall intensity of actual
dolphin encounter (Figure 3). A Vibrasonic
table produces vibra-tactile sound via huge
transducers placed underneath the mat-
tress. The transducers pump low frequency
signals directly into the soft tissues of the
body. Higher frequency audio signals, up to
150 kHz, are transduced directly onto nerve
pathways with a neurophone, a device in-
vented as a hearing aid for the deaf that
sends audio signals directly into the brain.
Cole feels that the neurophone accurately
reproduces the skin-to-water transduction
of dolphin echolocation energy.


The brain can register
slight differences in sound
intensity at either ear due to
head position in relation to
the arriving sound or
interpret differences in the 
time that a sound wave takes 
to arrive at either ear in 
directional terms


 The board is optimized to work 
in conjunction with video applica-
tions where high-quality output
and multichannel flexibility are
important. The EX-4 also supports
the ability to handle dual-device
operations; meaning that the board
has the ability to record on any
number of channels while playing 
back on the remaining channels.
All four channels are independent,
and they can perform functions
simultaneously.
  Another important feature for
video applications is EX-4's ability
to sync to an external tie source.
The card's two external clock in-
puts make it capable of syncing to
any external audio or video time.
The EX-4 is EISA-compatible and
can accommodate 32-bit data
transfers. The card also incorpo-
rates next-generation 64x over-
sampling A/D and D/A converters.
These features, combined with
balanced analog connections, al-
low for 22kHz bandwidth and a 
dynamic range of 92dB.
  A Windows NT driver is option-
ally available and supports Micro-
soft multimedia extensions, letting
the EX-4 be used with any multi-
media application. A hardware-de-
pendent module development kit
is also available and supports appli-
cations programming in DOS. The
kit provides low-level access to all


some funky macro utility that blindly
sends keystroke commands to an OS/2
PC. It's a systemwide procedural language
with a full set of operators. It sports a
number of third-party implementations,
including Borland's ObjectVision for
OS/2, Quercus Systems' Personal REXX
3.0 and HockWare's VisPro REXX Gold
Edition. You'll also find versions of REXX
for DOS, UNIX, Mac System 7 and even
Windows-Personal REXX for Windows
from Quercus Systems (800-440-5944,
408-867-7399).
  Mac power users, meanwhile, have
AppleScript built into System 7.5. Even
the Finder can now be scripted using Ap-
pleScript. Many third-party vendors (in-
cluding Microsoft) are creating Apple-
Script-aware programs that use the
language to automate tasks.
  You may wonder why I'm complain-
ing. After all, there are plenty of third-
party automation utilities available for
Windows. But Microsoft didn't take a
leadership position on what the stan-
dard Windows scripting language
should be. That's why we have a mind-
boggling number of incompatible, pro-
prietary options.
  The result is that we power Windows 
users are far less likely to embrace macros
and scripting than our OS/2 and Macin-
tosh brethren. Why bother to spend the
time to master some random language 
that may not be available in five years?
  As OS/2 and Mac power users become
increasingly familiar with REXX and Ap-
pleScript-~and the languages become
more mature-~end-user automation on
the Windows platform falls behind.
  Windows 3.x ships with the pathetic
Macro Recorder. It's not extensible. You
can't edit the scripts. And it has a lousy
interface. Macro Recorder is a joke.
  If you think that's funny, wait until


but your time. And often that cost is
too high.
  In today's competitive market, soft-
ware publishers will do almost anything
to grab a share of your mind, your hard
disk and ultimately your wallet. Some will
even give you their software hoping you'll
return to buy an upgrade. I'd rather they
charge me a few dollars and teach me
how to do something.
  Today, you can expect to see major
new products introduced with a special
"deal"-usually a low price. At introduc-
tion time, software publishers deeply dis-
count or give away their crown jewel to
capture you as a long-term customer.
  A few months ago, a government peri-
odical announced buyers could get the 
"lowest-ever" prices on four to five appli-
cation software suites. It pointed to a U.S.
General Services Administration (GSA)
price schedule that included Microsoft
Office at $260 for a master CD-ROM.
Even on the open market you can find
suites down to about $299.
  Sometimes software is beyond cheap-
it's free. Remember last year when Com-
puter Associates gave away more than a
million copies of its personal finance soft-
ware, Kiplinger's Simply Money? CA of-
fered the first version for the cost of ship-
ping and handling. Then last June, CA,
under the name 4Home Productions, in-
troduced an updated version for an up-
grade cost of $14.95. Now, version 2.0 car-
ries a street price of $34.95 and a January
promotion offered consumers a $15 re-
bate when they bought either Kiplinger's 
Simply Money or Simply Tax.
  Even venerable Microsoft bought its
way into the hearts, minds and machines
of database users. When Microsoft
launched Access at the bargain-basement
price of $99 it scorched earth. At the time,
most decent database software packages


DSP (DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING): Micro-
processors designed to operate on electrical
waveforms, like voice and video. DSP chips
can perform multiple functions, such as
wavetable synthesis, data transmission and
file compression. Depending on the archi-
tecture, a DSP chip can switch from one
task to another or, in some cases, perform
two tasks simultaneously. DSP functionali-
ty can be enhanced with software upgrades.
However, this is not the case with fixed-
function DSPs.

FM SYNTHESIS: A method of generating


sound through frequency modulation.
While FM synthesis provides stereo sound,
wavetable synthesis provides better and 
more realistic sound.

MIDI (MUSICAL INSTRUMENT DIGITAL INTER-
FACE): A protocol for communication with
and control of MIDI-compatible sound de-
vices, such as keyboards and synthesizers.
Not all MIDI-compatible cards have an
adapter that allows this communication. 
Some can only play back MIDI files.

TAPI (TELEPHONY APPLICATIONS PROGRAM-


MING INTERFACE): A standard that integrates
Windows PCs with telephone systems.
TAPI was developed by Microsoft in con-
junction with Intel and several major tele-
phone equipment manufacturers, and will
be directly included in Windows 95. A card
that is not TAPI compliant may work with
Windows 95, but there are no guarantees.

WAVETABLE SYNTHESIS: A method of syn-
thesizing sound using short samples (stored
on the card or in software) of actual instru-
ments. Wavetable synthesis sounds more
realistic than FM synthesis.

The P6 seems poised to take over the
desktop and nearly all else-~eventually.

The Hexium? The Sexium? The Intel marketing folks
do have a slight problem. Still, whatever Intel ulti-
mately calls the P6, it's going to be fast. Expect the
initial, 133-MHz P6-~which will probably appear in the
fall-~to deliver roughly twice the performance of a 90-
MHz Pentium. Future P6 chips will run at clock speeds
of 200 MHz and possibly greater.

Down to the Core The P6 will achieve its performance
gain over the Pentium partly through its decoupled,
asynchronous superscalar organization. AMD's forth-
coming K5, which should appear in an initial 100-MHz
version in the fall, uses a similar microarchitecture. No
clear winner emerges if you judge the P6 and K5 by their
internal organizations alone, but differences beyond the
processors' RISC-like cores will probably allow the P6 to
maintain a solid performance advantage. The P6 adds 
a dedicated 64-bit L2 cache interface, for example, which
allows the chip to access the secondary cache at full
processor speed. 

RISC Business Unlike the K5, which AMD made pin-
compatible with the Pentium to encourage vendor accep-
tance, the P6 also implements a split-transaction exter-
nal bus. This new interface will increase bus bandwidth
considerably. Along with other P6 features such as inter-
nal parity checking and an integrated APIC interrupt
controller, the split-transaction bus prepares the P6 to
meet what is surely one of Intel's goals: the conquest of 
even the high-end server market and other niche mar-
kets that more-expensive RISC systems now dominate.

Pentium Still Reigns We wouldn't recommend that
you become too attached to your Pentium system if
you haven't already, but the Pentium will still domi-
nate for some time to come. Initial P6s will undoubt-
edly find an enthusiastic market among those willing 
to pay top dollar for the best performance, but over at
least the next 18 months, the Pentium will probably
offer a price/performance mix much better suited to
the mainstream. AMD, Cyrix, and NexGen have each
announced chips that may outperform the Pentium
at identical clock speeds, and each company promises
faster future offerings, but Intel seems prepared to stay
a step ahead with still-faster Pentiums and the forth-
coming P6. By the time you read this, Intel will be ship-
ping 120-MHz Pentiums, and we expect to see 150-
MHz Pentium chips by the end of 1995. -~Mitt Jones

Love on the ROM

As a roving urban chickie, I am abundantly qualified to take CD-
ROMANCE, a quarterly CD-ROM singles magazine, for a spin. With
more than 300 video-enhanced personals from men and women in the US
to choose from, I figured my pursuit of a playmate was sure to be a fun
and successful endeavor. 
  After a less-than-one-frame-per-second video introduction, I filled out
the rudimentary questionnaire, describing whom I was seeking: age 21 to
39; height 6 feet or taller; religious and ethnic options - blank; search
words "ski" and "sail." Then I gleefully awaited my potential mates. There
were none. I was an unmatchable woman (proving my last boyfriend right
on that score!). Nixing the search words, I was promptly matched with
five men. Hmm. Apparently, common interests hold little sway with this
electronic matchmaker.
  No matter: five eligible bachelors were lined up to meet me - all a
quick e-mail or voicemail away! First there was Adam, an interesting
creature, who provided a photo montage, audio track, and video clip of
himself. A biomedical engineering student/guitarist big on Spyro Gyra


and classic rock, we had nothing in common but being human and Jew-
ish. Plus, he's in Chicago, making lunch dates a stretch.
  Next is Bob. Bob's fave food is milkshakes. Bob is also into classic rock,
and his favorite entertainer is Cindy Crawford. Nuff said. I browsed on and
came across Bryan, who blades and likes U2 and Green Eggs and Ham.
We were getting warmer, except that he lives in Cincinnati.
  Frank, another classic-rock aficionado (apparently the keyword "classic
rock" would garner more fans than Toto!), was seeking a woman who
lived in Georgia.
  This was silly. What's the attraction of tinny audios and jerky videos of
men located all across America? But, trooper that I am, I clicked on man
number five, Matthew. A Vegas-based lawyer, he digs R.E.M. and Melrose
Place. Right on! In his personal comments, he said the CD-ROM seemed
an easier way to meet women "than trying out for Studs." Unfortunately,
I'd have to disagree. - Jennifer Cowan

In his best-selling book Cuckoo's Egg, astronomer
and part-time computer scientist Clifford Stoll told
of his pursuit and capture of a gang of German hack-
ers. Now, he's back with a 230-page meditation on
life in cyberspace. And his report is bleak.
  Silicon Snake Oil is a loose collection of anecdotes
and bon mots that illustrate his twin themes: too
often we mistake information for knowledge, and
cyberspace is no substitute for real-world sensation.
Stoll argues that the speed of online discussion
fosters flames rather than reasoned debate, that
mastering the constantly changing skills required to
use computers is time poorly spent, that the fancy
text and graphics possible with computer publishing
leads to a false and dangerous sense of professional-
ism, that our lives would probably be better if we
tossed some of the newfangled contraptions.


  Stoll says nothing that cultural critics such as Sven
Birkerts and Neil Postman haven't said many times
before, and more eloquently. But because Stoll
really knows computers, from the frustration of Unix
manuals to the intricacies of TCP/IP, his criticisms can
get under your skin.
  You want to tell him: "Yeah, but next year's ver-
sion...." and "Sure, but with all the time I save...."
But after Stoll's fiftieth example of how computers
force us to master technical minutiae at the expense
of real learning, those replies seem less credible.
This book is too relentlessly one-sided and too ram-
bling to be read straight through, or to be entirely
convincing. But when your eyes get blurry from
staring at a computer screen, pick up this book and
read a page at random. Then go outside with a clear
conscience. -Steve G. Steinberg

For a clear conscience, take these bon mots a page at a time.

Of course, it may sacrifice some emotional
power, but I sometimes imagine it may start
to gain a kind of linguistic power - universali-
ty, specificity. As it becomes ubiquitous, peo-
ple will want music purpose-designed much
more. Just as you choose to arrange things
and colors in your house in a particular way,
I think you will choose music like that. Imag-
ine that you order an evening of music over
the Net. You say, "We're having a dinner, peo-
ple should be able to talk over the music, I'm
fond of Pachelbel's Canon and Joni Mitchell
and Miles Davis. Can you put together three
hours for me?" Whereupon the brain of the
system looks through its ever-evolving "taste-
clumps" - the product of continuous cust-
omer research - and says, "Someone who
likes those things is quite likely to also enjoy
some of the quieter moments of Hector Zazou,


Jane Siberry, and Jon Hassell." It will compile
a combination of all those. This is an autocu-
rator. You could even tell it how experimental
you wanted it to be: "Really surprise me - pull
out a few long shots."
There is a book called Elevator Music that
calls elevator music and Muzak "furniture
music" - utilitarian fixtures of our environ-
ment. It says more is going on in that kind 
of music than most people think.
Yes! I'm always thrilled when someone sud-
denly says, Hey! you can take this seriously
as well. It's like a new piece of the world that
suddenly opens up for you.
So what kind of cultural margins do you
think we should be taking seriously now?
I'm trying to take videogames and video-
game music seriously. Videogame music
is not music that I would listen to as on a 
CD, but automatically evolved video music
would be a million times better than hav-
ing to hear that idiot music that repeats
itself over and over again. The number
of hours that people listen to Mario Broth-
ers music is probably greater than the
total number of hours that people listen
to Beethoven.
That's probably true.
The total number of hours that people are


listening to game music probably exceeds
all hours spent listening to classical music,
so it's very important that there be some
kind of mechanical music worth listening
to. I see a place for machine music as some-
where between the handcrafted music sold
on albums, and pure, canned, inane, repe-
titious stuff. Ideally, what we want in a
videogame or an interactive experience is
automatic music that's adjusting in real
time to what we're doing. The music is
changing depending on what's happening 
on the screen.
Automatic music becomes interesting when
it does something we didn't expect. Yet mere
"didn't expect" isn't good enough - we have
to already have a framework of expectations
against which to be surprised. That frame-
work can be simple - such as one's sense of


wonder when the tape loops in Steve Reich's
"It's Gonna Rain" mysteriously recombine to
produce something apparently quite different 
from what they are. That's a surprise of
synergy. Another kind of surprise is that of
extension - such as when Dorothy Love
Coates collapses down to that beautiful,
heartbreaking low note in "Lord Don't Forget
about Me," just when you thought she could
never go any lower. That kind of surprise is
difficult to get from a machine, because it
depends so much on our empathy with
another human, and on our belief that this
music represents some feeling that a human
is having or could have.
  Of course, a lot of the remixing of musical
tracks - which is so fashionable now - has an
automatic music feel about it: spin a few
samples and see what they do together.
The other thing about all this remixing is,
who keeps track of the intellectual proper-
ty rights as bits of music are passed from
studio to studio?
Intellectual rights is the hottest area going,
and certainly not only in music. There are so
many uniquely new problems. For example, I
think of producing as the act of creating a 
sonic and conceptual overview of the record.
And this type of creation is a whole new cate-


gory for which there is no current copyright
arrangement. When you're using sophisticat-
ed tools with very strong personalities, is the
designer of the tools in some sense responsi-
ble for what finally comes out? Should that
designer benefit? When a new tool or tech-
nology comes into existence, and suddenly 50
people at the same time see the same obvious 
idea, is it right that the one who gets to the
publisher or patent office first should get all
the material benefits of that idea? If not, how
else do we share it?
I'm impressed with Bruce Sterling, the sci-
ence fiction writer. He's loaded much of his 
nonfiction writing onto the Net. He says, in
effect, This is copyrighted, but you can
make a copy of it for noncommercial rea-
sons; go ahead, he says, spread it around. 
He calls it Literary Freeware. He encourages
people to make a copy of a book of his that
is still in print.
I've always thought one of the most fantastic
things about the Grateful Dead was that
instead of sending heavies down into the 
crowd to smash people over the head and
take their cassette recorders, they offered
them a nice board to plug into so at least they
got a decent recording.
I'm curious about the economic motives of
artists in these technological times. At the
first hearing, ambient music sounds like
music that was made because it could be
made. When you were first making ambient
music, did you expect anybody to buy it?
Yes! As with everything I do, I expected it to
be tremendously successful. [Laughs.]
What led you to believe anybody else
wanted to listen to that kind of music, as it
was so mechanical and not fashionable?
I'll tell you what it was. It was based on an
observation that my tastes aren't that different
from other people's. I always know that if I
like something now, enough other people are
going to like it soon enough. For instance,
when I got into female body builders, every
guy I knew was saying, Oh god! It's gross! I 
said, Oh yeah, this is just the last wall of resis-
tance before they finally admit that they think
these women are enormously sexy. Sure
enough, they do now. I just admit to my tastes
sooner. I don't have any embarrassment about
what I like. It doesn't threaten what I've liked
before even when it appears completely 
inconsistent with it. I don't mind the tension,
and I don't think I have to compromise my
whole theory of life to accept this thing. If I'm
attracted to something, I immediately surren-
der to it. I offer no resistance to being
seduced. Because I offer no resistance, I think
that I sometimes touch things more quickly 
than other people do. ~ ~ ~

Paine

~ 213 conservative in order not to lose favor
with society. Paine did neither and fell from
grace. Many of his reform programs will
remain unacceptable to political conserva-
tives and his religious views will always
offend believing Christians. Though his
memory is invoked from time to time, his
resurrection will never be complete.
  At the moment, though, he is showing
signs of minor resurgence. In 1994, officials
in Washington, DC, were considering funding
a monument to him somewhere. And Sir
Richard Attenborough, the famed British
actor and director, has been struggling for
several years to get studio backing for a film
about Paine.
  A Paine bio - featuring two bloody revolu-
tions, standoffs with Napoleon, tangles with
the British royals, and cameo roles for Wash-
ington, Jefferson, Robespierre, and his neme-
sis George III - would make a socko TV 
miniseries, too.
  Nigel Hawthorne could play Paine's father,
who intercepted his runaway teenage son in
1756 as he was about to board the Terrible, a
privateer captained by a man named William
Death. Heeding his father's desperate plea,
Paine didn't sail. Shortly afterward, the Terri-
ble was engaged by a French privateer, the
Vengeance, and was horribly mauled. More
than 150 members of its crew were killed,
including Captain Death and all but one of
his officers.
  Anthony Hopkins could star in Rights of
Man, playing the role of the Honourable
Spencer Perceval, who stood up at the Guild-
hall in London to read out the sedition
charges against the absent Paine in 1792 and
accuse him of being "wicked, malicious, and
ill-disposed."
  And imagine the scene of his near-execu-
tion. Paine went to France after the Revolu-
tionary War as a hero and supporter of
democratization there. But the French Revo-
lution was far bloodier and more violent than
the American. Paine tried to save King Louis
XVI's life and pleaded with the country's new
rulers to be merciful and democratic. Eventu-
ally, he was imprisoned and sentenced to
death. In June 1794, six months into his har-
rowing imprisonment, watching as hundreds 
of fellow prisoners were led off to be killed,
Paine fell into a feverish semiconsciousness.
His fellow cellmates barely kept him alive,
mopping his brow, feeding him soup, and
changing his clothes.
  The prison governors were ordered to send
him to the guillotine the next morning. At 6
a.m., a turnkey carrying Paine's death war-


rant walked quietly down the prison corri-
dors, chalking the cell doors of the con-
demned, marking the number 4 on the inside 
of Paine's door. Usually the turnkey marked
the outside of the door, but Paine was seri-
ously ill, and his cellmates had been granted
permission to leave the door open so that a
breeze could help cool Paine's profusely
sweating body.
  That evening, the weather cooled, and
Paine's cellmates asked a different turnkey
for permission to close the door. Knowing
that the number on the door was now
inward, the occupants of the cell waited,
Paine murmuring on his cot. Near midnight,
the death squad slowly made its way down
the corridor, keys jangling, pistols drawn.
One of his friends cupped his hand over 
Paine's mouth. The squad paused, then
moved on to the next cell.
  A few days later, the Jacobin government
was overthrown. A fellow prisoner said Paine
had struggled to keep his democratic values


alive in prison. "He was the confidant of the
unhappy, the counselor of the perplexed; and
to his sympathizing friendship many a devot-
ed victim in the hour of death confided the
last cares of humanity; and the last wishes of
tenderness."
  Despite his close call, Paine stayed in
France until 1802 when he managed, inevit-
ably, to alienate Napoleon. At the invitation of
Jefferson, he returned to the United States to 
a hostile welcome.
  Although he had left the United States a 
revolutionary hero, Paine soon outraged the
American clergy by publishing The Age of
Reason. He infuriated the business communi-
ty with his pro-labor writings in England and
by publishing Agrarian Justice. He also wan-
dered into the middle of increasingly vicious
domestic politics. Federalists, looking for
ground to attack Jefferson, seized upon his
invitation to Paine to come home. Paine was
savaged as a heretic, and as an unwashed,
drunken infidel. He was attacked in columns
and stories, insulted on the streets and in
public places. Not only had the children for-
gotten the father, they had turned on him.
  Paine didn't see, writes Keane, "that he was


among the first modern public figures to
suffer firsthand an increasingly concentrated
press equipped with the power to peddle one-
sided interpretations of the world."
  Perhaps, if a movie is made and Paine
becomes a focus of attention once more,
somebody could locate his bones. That they
are missing may be the most fitting postscript
to his life. British journalist and Paine con-
temporary William Cobbett smarted at the
way Paine had been neglected in his final
years. Cobbett wrote, in his Cobbett's Weekly
Political Register, under the pseudonym of
Peter Porcupine: "Paine lies in a little hole
under the grass and weeds of an obscure
farm in America. There, however, he shall
not lie, unnoticed, much longer. He belongs
to England."
  Just before dawn one autumn night in
1819, Cobbett, his son, and a friend went to
Paine's New Rochelle farm - the hole under
the grass is still there, marked by a plaque
from the Thomas Paine National Historical

RADAR


~ Composite Bellwether (5 this month/4 last month) This
index, computed by InvesTech, tracks utility and brokerage stocks, which
usually predict market turns. The indicator has been tracking upward along
with the broader market, but weakness in utilities remains a drag.

~ Put/Call Ratio (4/5) Based on the volume of equity put and call
options traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. This contrarian
indicator turns negative if traders are betting on a stock surge-which they
have been lately, after being noncommittal for three months.

~ Advance/Decline Line (3/2) A moving average of the differ-
ence between the number of rising and falling stocks, this shows whether
market moves are broadly or narrowly based. Computed by InvesTech, the
measure recently bounced back to provide support for the Dow's run-up.

~ Advisory Sentiment (6/6) Investment advisors tend to be fol-
lowers, not leaders. Historically, they get most excited at market tops. We
fretted last month as their optimism waxed ever stronger, but the good
feeling seems to have plateaued. Compiled by Investors Intelligence.


~ Commodity Index (3/4) Supplied by Goldman, Sachs, this mea-
sure of raw-material prices has jumped nearly 4 percent in the last month,
driven by increases in energy and precious metals. The index now shows a
net rise of 1.5 percent for 1995 to date, boding ill for inflation.

~ Consumer and Corporate Debt (5/5) This aggregate mea-
sure of private debt has resumed its upward trend, a bad sign. But the rise
is being fueled partly by dramatic growth in real-estate lending, which
probably will slow down soon. Provided by Safian Investment Research.

leagues. Wakeman spends three to four
hours a day talking to other fund managers.
He regularly badges Price's 26 research an-
alysts for ideas. His old department, he says,
is nothing less than a "gold mine."
  Gold mines do have their risks. The de-
partment recently directed him toward, and
then steered him away from, a catastrophic 
stock pick: Exide Corp., a Michigan com-
pany founded by Thomas Edison that makes
and sells batteries for cars and boats world-
wide. The stock had been a Wall Street fa-
vorite since going public in late 1993, and it
shot from $20 per share to $56 by year-end
1994. Near the end of January 1995, when
the stock dipped to $48, an analyst brought 
the stock to Wakeman's attention and sug-
gested he take a look. Wakeman started re-
searching it. But another analyst, William 
Stromberg, talked Wakeman out of the
stock in early March. Stromberg warned
that the company could have earnings prob-
lems because of the warm weather being ex-
perienced throughout the Northeast.
  Stromberg was right: North America had
the second warmest winter on record, and
Europe experienced its warmest winter in
400 years. Batteries weren't dying, cus-
tomers weren't buying, and Exide's earnings 
fell below expectations. "Now it could lose
a lot of money, and I may buy it when it 
settles in the $30 range," Wakeman says.
  Wakeman's best pick so far has been
Adobe Systems, a Silicon Valley graphics
software company that he bought at $30 in
December. "The stock looked cheap to us,"


Dayton Hudson. In early January, Wake-
man invested $850,000 in the company.
"But Christmas was bad," he says, shaking
his head. "And the first quarter went soft
again because consumer spending was
down." By mid-March, Dayton Hudson
had fallen off its perch in the low 80s to set-
tle in the high 60s.
  It was a crucible for Wakeman; he liter-
ally wrings his hands as he describes it. "I
thought at first, managing a fund is going to
be great when it's working well," he says.
"But when the big stocks blow up, how will
I deal with it? Managing a new fund sounds
really neat on paper, but once I get in the
real world, how am I going to do?"
  He won't, he hopes, give in to what he
knows is his biggest flaw as an investor. "I
tend to overanalyze," he says. "Fund man-
agers, like everyone else, now face informa-
tion overload, and analysis can lead to
paralysis. Sometimes I sit here and look at
information about a stock and don't move
on it." Last December, for example, Wake-
man missed out on the Apollo Group, an
online education and testing service that was
trading at $12. Since he wanted more in-
formation on it, he never got around to
buying it. "It went to $25 in my face with-
in three months," he recalls with a grimace.
"Good move, John."

WAKEMAN ROUTINELY RETURNS HOME
around 8 P.M. after a last round of debates
with his fellow fund managers. Then he
works a couple hours more. "We're not


Clayton Preuitt  JUNE 1995 worth 85
lacked was $150,000 in Silicon Graphics
workstations, Wavefront computer-graphics
software, international connections, and a
nice office. We supplied all that in return for
a controlling interest in the business, which
was renamed Media Arts.
  When friends ask me what "computer 
graphics" really are, I explain it this way.
You know that winged horse at the start of
all Tri-Star motion pictures? It's not a real
horse. Not that we did that particular horse,
or have done anything at all just yet for Tri-
Star. But our equipment is in use virtually 
24 hours a day.
  And we've started a media-monitoring 
business. At an office a few miles away, we
have a bank of TVs and VCRs and a crew 
employed to tape everything that plays on
Russian TV, keeping a log of what com-
mercials are played when. That way, adver-
tisers can verify they got the ad time they
paid for-and get a clear idea of what their
competitors are doing.
  My role in this is as wire clerk. And al-
though the novelty is beginning to wear off,
it's heady stuff. Picture it. To get the Wave-
front software to our new office in Moscow,
I wired dollars from our account in Miami
to the Taipei account of the Dutch compa-
ny that represents Wavefront in Russia. It
then delivered the software in Moscow and
(presumably) forwarded payment to Wave-
front in California. Ah, brave new world.
  Meanwhile, some of our business comes
direct to the States (1-800-MEDIART-I
kid you not), so again I get to play wire
clerk. In February, the bank called to tell me
that a $450,000 wire had just come in from 
France. This was to pay for commercial time
on Russian TV, so a few days later my part-
ners E-mailed me instructions on wiring
most of it back out: $235,000 to an account
in Moscow and $201,000 to an account in 
Latvia. (Latvia!)
  I dutifully fired off the wire instructions,
and the bank dutifully fired off the wires.
  Normally, that would have been the end
of it, but later that day I got a call from Ilya
in Moscow. "Have the wires gone out?"
he asked.
  "I think so-why?"
  "Can you stop them?" he asked.
  "I don't know-I doubt it," I said, grow-
ing ever so slightly nervous. "Why?"
  Ilya reported that the aforementioned
highly popular 38-year-old TV czar,
Vladimir Listyev, had just been assassinated.
Chaos reigned. Ilya thought it would be a 


good idea to stop the wires.
  It was seven minutes to five in Miami
(nearly one A.M. in Moscow), so I hung
up and called the bank. "Well, it's not 100
percent guaranteed," I was told, "but we
can recall the wires in the morning and
chances are the money will come back."
  So I asked them to do that-all of this 
confirmed in writing, of course-apologiz-
ing for the inconvenience. "The irony," I 
said, "is that things are likely to settle back
down in a day or two and we'll have to send 
the darn wires out all over again. But better 
safe than sorry."
  Sure enough, a day or two later, that's just
what happened. I received word from my
partners that it was okay to send the money.
  The $235,000 from Moscow had already
come back, so I instructed the bank to send
it back out. "And if the $201,000 comes
back from Latvia, send it back out, too."
  Twelve days passed. I was out of town,
thinking about other things, but then came
an E-mail from Moscow. Where's the 
$235,000?
  I called my counterpart at the bank.
"Oh," she said. "I was going to call you this
morning."
  "Yeah?"
  It seems that instead of resending the
$235,000 that had come back from 
Moscow, she had accidentally resent a sec-
ond $201,000 to Latvia.
  I won't take you through every twist and
turn. Suffice it to say that Latvia is not Cleve-
land. The Latvians apparently thought this
second $201,000 was a miracle. An answered 
prayer. Can you imagine how much money 
$201,000 is in Latvia? When the Latvians
were apprised of the error and asked to return
the money, they said, "No." The Latvian
bank was contacted directly by a vice presi-
dent of the Miami bank. "Forget it," he was 
told. "You're not getting the money back."
  This made the Miami bank, which ac-
knowledged it was their problem not ours
(but which showed a $170,000 overdraft in
our account all the same), highly nervous.
The FBI was contacted; Kroll Associates, a 
private investigative firm, was poised to
strike. At the 11th hour, our partners in
Moscow prevailed on their partners' part-
ners in Latvia to force the bank to return
the money. Something like that. All I know
is that the money came back.
  And now a nice wire has come in from 
Hong Kong, from a client who wants to sell
TVs in Russia.
